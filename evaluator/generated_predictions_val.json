    "crs_R45636": "Since the founding, the federal courts have played a critical role in adjudicating legal disputes, including ones involving executive action. As the Supreme Court stated in Marbury v. Madison, \"where a specific duty is assigned by law.. the individual who considers himself injured[] has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy.\" Naturally, Congress and its Members have an interest in litigating in federal court, for example, to vindicate their institutional priorities, to argue that the Executive is violating their legislative prerogatives, or to advance their legislative policy interests. During the Obama Administration, for instance, legislative entities brought or joined litigation in federal court for a host of reasons, such as to challenge the Executive's decision to allegedly expend money without a congressional appropriation, to defend the Defense of Marriage Act from constitutional challenge in lieu of the Executive, and to challenge the Executive's decision to engage in military action in Libya. Likewise, during the Trump Administration, legislators have become involved in lawsuits that challenge the President's alleged unconstitutional acceptance of emoluments, suits demanding the production of documents from the Administration, and, in an amicus capacity, challenges to legality of the so-called travel ban. Congressional interest in litigation may increase in salience under the current divided government, as illustrated by the House of Representatives' resolution to authorize the House to participate in ongoing litigation in Texas involving the Affordable Care Act and a recent lawsuit brought by several Members of Congress challenging the President's appointment of an acting Attorney General. However, whenever any party seeks to invoke the power of the federal courts, it must first show that its dispute belongs there. For nearly its entire history, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the role of courts is in \"decid[ing] on the rights of individuals.\" By contrast, \"[v]indicating the public interest (including the public interest in Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.\" The federal courts apply a number of doctrines, known as justiciability doctrines, to ensure that they do not step beyond their bounds and decide issues more properly reserved for the other branches. Foremost among these doctrines is the requirement that a party seeking judicial relief from a federal court demonstrate \"standing.\" This report provides an overview of the standing doctrine as it applies to lawsuits involving legislators, committees, and houses of Congress. First, the report lays out the general rules of standing as they apply in every case in the federal courts and the main purpose behind the doctrine. One central purpose of the standing doctrine\u2014protecting the court's role in the constitutional balance of powers\u2014is a theme that underlies this report, as many of these cases involve courts deciding whether they have the power to adjudicate high-profile political disputes between the other two branches of the federal government. Next, the report considers the relatively few Supreme Court cases to discuss legislator standing, explaining the general principles that courts have drawn from those cases. The report then analyzes how lower courts have interpreted the limited Supreme Court case law on the issue, beginning with cases involving individual legislators, and following with cases brought by entire institutions, such as committees or houses of a legislature. The report then considers other issues relating to legislator participation in litigation, such as intervention under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or participation purely as an \"amicus curiae,\" or a \"friend of the court.\" The report concludes by identifying unresolved doctrinal questions and offering takeaways for prospective congressional litigants.",
    "crs_R45491": "Science and technology (S&T) play an important role in our society. Advances in science and technology can help drive economic growth and meet national priorities in public health, environmental protection, agricultural productivity, defense, and many other areas. Federal policies affect scientific and technological advancement on several levels. The federal government directly funds research and development (R&D) activities to achieve national goals or support national priorities, such as funding basic life science research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or developing new weapons systems in the Department of Defense (DOD). The federal government also establishes and maintains the legal and regulatory framework that affects S&T activities in the private sector. In addition, federal tax, trade, and education policies can have effects on private sector S&T activity. This report serves as a brief introduction to many of the science and technology policy issues that may come before the 116th Congress.

This election win gave Representative Rankin the dist inction of being the first woman elected to serve in Congress. The first woman to serve in the Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-GA). She was appointed in 1922 and served for one day. Three hundred sixty five women have been elected or appointed to Congress. These figures include six nonvoting Delegates, one each from Guam, Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and American Samoa, and two from the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as one Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. Of these 365 women, there have been 247 Democrats and 118 Republicans; 309 (211 Democrats, 98 Republicans) women elected only in the House of Representatives, including 7 (4 Democrats, 3 Republicans) women who have served as Delegates or Resident Commissioners in the House; 40 (25 Democrats, 15 Republicans) women elected or appointed only in the Senate; and 16 (11 Democrats, 5 Republicans) women elected or appointed in both houses.

    "crs_R44737": "In academic year (AY) 2017-2018, 6,700 institutions of higher education (IHEs), enrolling over 27 million postsecondary education students in AY2016-2017, participated in the federal student aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329, as amended). These IHEs ranged in sector, size, and educational programs offered. They comprised all sectors (i.e., public, private nonprofit, and proprietary), with some IHEs enrolling as few as three students and others enrolling over 190,000 in a single year. Offered educational programs varied from certificate programs in career and technical fields to doctoral and professional degree programs. Most of these IHEs operate from year to year with few severe financial or operational concerns; however, each year, a few do face such concerns, which may cause them to cease or significantly curtail operations. The recent closure of multiple large, proprietary (or private, for-profit) IHEs has brought into focus the extent to which a postsecondary student's education may be disrupted by a school closure. However, even in instances of a small IHE's closure, student concerns remain the same. Concerns include the following, among others: Can they continue their postsecondary education at another school? How will they finance future postsecondary educational pursuits? Are they liable for repaying loans they may have borrowed to pursue a postsecondary credential that they were unable to obtain because of an IHE's closure? This report provides an explanation of the options a postsecondary student may pursue in the event the IHE he or she attends closes, any financial relief that may be available to such students, and other practical implications for students following a school's closure. First, this report describes the academic options available to such students, such as participating in a teach-out or transferring to a new IHE. Next, it discusses issues related to financing a postsecondary education, including the extent to which borrowers may have any loans borrowed to finance educational expenses discharged due to a school closure and whether future financial assistance, including federal student loans, Pell Grants, and GI educational benefits, may be available to students should they decide to continue their postsecondary education at another IHE. This report then describes additional relief that may be available to students who attended IHEs that closed, such as the potential to have tuition paid reimbursed through a state tuition recovery fund. Finally, this report describes some potential income tax implications for students when their IHE has closed, including the extent to which they may incur a federal income tax liability for loans discharged and whether higher education tax credits remain available to them in future years.",
    "crs_R45461": "The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act), enacted on October 5, 2018, is a law to reauthorize the (unrelated) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (H.R. 302/P.L. 115-254). Under the BUILD Act, the IDFC is to consolidate and expand the U.S. government's existing development finance functions\u2014currently conducted primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). By statute, the IDFC is a successor agency to OPIC, which is to terminate when the IDFC is operational. The BUILD Act consolidates functions currently carried out primarily by OPIC and certain elements of USAID. The IDFC's authorities would expand beyond OPIC's existing authorities to make loans and guarantees and issue insurance or reinsurance. They would also include the authority to take minority equity positions in investments, subject to limitations. In addition, unlike OPIC, the IDFC would be able to issue loans in local currency. The extent to which USAID functions will be transferred to the new IDFC is less clear. The act specifies that the Development Credit Authority (DCA), the existing legacy credit portfolio under the Urban and Environment Credit Program, and any other direct loan programs and non-DCA guarantee programs shall be transferred to the IDFC. It also provides the authority for, but does not require, the transfer of USAID's Office of Private Capital and Microenterprise, the existing USAID-managed enterprise funds (it gives the IDFC authority to establish new funds), and the sovereign loan guarantee portfolio. The disposition of these functions is to be detailed in the reorganization plan that the Administration must submit to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The reorganization plan is expected to be submitted by early February 2019. In addition, the IDFC would have the authority to conduct feasibility studies on proposed investment projects (with cost sharing) and provide technical assistance. The BUILD Act follows long-standing debate among policymakers over whether or not government financing of private-sector activity is appropriate. Supporters argued that OPIC helps fill in gaps in private-sector support that arise from market failures and helps U.S. firms compete against foreign firms backed by foreign DFIs for investment opportunities\u2014thereby advancing U.S. foreign policy, national security, and economic interests. Opponents held that OPIC diverts capital away from efficient uses and crowds out private alternatives, criticized OPIC for assuming risks unwanted by the private sector, and questioned the development benefits of its programs. They have called for terminating OPIC's functions or privatizing them. While the BUILD Act garnered overall support, specific aspects of it were subject to debate. Some development advocates expressed concern that the BUILD Act's transfer of DCA and other credit program authority from USAID to the IDFC may sever the close link between these funding mechanisms and the USAID development programs into which they have been embedded, potentially making the tools less effective and less development-oriented. Others saw potential for the DCA to become a more robust financing option for USAID programs under the new IDFC, with its expanded authorities. In response to these concerns, the BUILD Act includes many provisions, discussed later in this report, to promote coordination and linkages between USAID and the IDFC, and to emphasize the development mission of the IDFC. Some in the development community also questioned whether the new DFI would have a sufficiently strong development mandate, as well as raised concerns about the transparency, environmental, and social standards of the new DFI relative to OPIC. Some critics of OPIC supported strengthening statutorily the aim of the IDFC in specifically countering China's growing economic influence in developing countries. Other possible policy alternatives include focusing on enhancing coordination of development finance functions among agencies or supporting development goals through multilateral and regional DFIs in which the United States plays a major leadership role.",
    "crs_R41352": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loans for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and access to entrepreneurial education to assist with business formation and expansion. The SBA currently provides financial support to about 14,000 resource partners, including 63 small business development centers (SBDCs) and nearly 900 SBDC local outreach locations, 128 women's business centers (WBCs), and 350 chapters of the mentoring program, SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives). The SBA receives an annual appropriation for entrepreneurial development/noncredit programs collectively (currently $247.7 million). The SBA uses these funds for its management and training programs ($226.7 million in FY2019), administration of the HUBZone program ($3.0 million), and the State Trade and Export Promotion program ($18.0 million). Congress specifies the appropriation amount for SBDCs (currently $131.0 million) and the Microloan Technical Assistance Program (currently $31.0 million) in its annual appropriation act and includes recommended appropriation amounts for the SBA's other management and training programs in either the explanatory statement or the committee report accompanying the appropriations act. The SBA is not legally required to adhere to the recommended amounts but has traditionally done so in the past. For many years, a recurring theme at congressional hearings concerning the SBA's management and technical assistance training programs has been the perceived need to improve program efficiency by eliminating duplication of services and increasing cooperation and coordination both within and among its training resource partners. For example, the Obama Administration recommended in its FY2012-FY2017 budget recommendations that funding for the PRIME technical assistance program end. The Administration argued that PRIME overlaps and duplicates \"the technical assistance provided by SBA's microlending intermediaries.\" The Trump Administration has also requested the program's elimination. The House Committee on Small Business has argued that the SBA's various management and technical assistance training programs should be \"folded into the mission of the SBDC program or their responsibilities should be taken over by other agencies\" because they \"overlap each other and duplicate the educational services provided by other agencies.\" Congress has also explored ways to improve the SBA's measurement of these programs' effectiveness. This report examines the historical development of federal small business management and technical assistance training programs; describes their current structures, operations, and budgets; and assesses their administration and oversight, including measures used to determine their effectiveness. This report also examines legislation to improve SBA program performance and oversight, including P.L. 114-88, the Recovery Improvements for Small Entities After Disaster Act of 2015 (RISE After Disaster Act of 2015). P.L. 114-88, among other provisions, relaxed requirements that Microloan intermediaries may spend no more than 25% of Microloan technical assistance grant funds on prospective borrowers and no more than 25% of those funds on contracts with third parties to provide that technical assistance by increasing those percentages to no more than 50% (originally in H.R. 2056, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2017, and S. 526, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2018). In addition, it discusses H.R. 1774, the Developing the Next Generation of Small Businesses Act of 2017, which was introduced during the 115th Congress. The bill would have required the SBA to only use authorized entrepreneurial development programs (SCORE, WBCs, SBDCs, etc.) \"to deliver entrepreneurial development services, entrepreneurial education, support for the development and maintenance of clusters, or business training\" and would have added SBDC data collection and reporting requirements. Similar legislation was introduced during the 114th Congress (H.R. 207 and S. 999). The SBA supports a number of management and technical assistance training programs, including the following: Small Business Development Center Grants Program, Microloan Technical Assistance Program, Women's Business Center Grants Program, Veterans Business Development Programs, SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives), PRIME Technical Assistance Program, 7(j) Technical Assistance Program, Native American Outreach Program, and Several initiatives, including the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters), Boots to Business, Entrepreneurial Education, and Growth Accelerators. The legislative history and current operating structures, functions, and budget for each of these programs is presented in this report. In addition, if the data are available, the program's performance based on outcome-based measures, such as their effect on small business formation,",

FVPSA programs are carried out by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACF administers most FVPSA programming, including grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes to support local organizations that provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children. ACF also provides funding for a national domestic violence hotline that responds to calls, texts, and web-based chats from individuals seeking assistance. The funding for ACF also supports state domestic violence coalitions that provide training for and advocacy on behalf of domestic violence providers within each state, as well as multiple resource centers that provide training and technical assistance on various domestic violence issues for a variety of stakeholders. The CDC funds efforts to prevent domestic violence through a program known as Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Allies (DELTA). The House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) Committee have exercised jurisdiction over FVPSA. The report begins with background on the definitions of domestic violence and related terms. This background section also describes the risk factors for domestic violence and estimates of the number of victims. The next section of the report addresses the history leading up to the enactment of FVPSA, and the major components of the act: a national domestic violence hotline, support for domestic violence shelters and nonresidential services, and community-based responses to prevent domestic violence. The report then discusses efforts under FVPSA to assist children and youth exposed to domestic violence, including teen dating violence. Finally, the report provides an overview of FVPSA's interaction with other federal laws, including the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) and the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA, P.L. 103-322). FVPSA was the first federal law to address domestic violence, with a focus on providing shelter and services for survivors; however, since the enactment of VAWA in 1994, the federal response to domestic violence has expanded to involve multiple departments and activities that include investigating and prosecuting crimes and providing additional services to victims and abusers. FVPSA also includes provisions that encourage or require program administrators to coordinate FVPSA programs with related programs and research carried out by other federal agencies. The appendices provide further detail about FVPSA-related definitions and funding, and statistics related to domestic violence victimization.",
    "crs_R45667": "Enacted in 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, now known as the Pittman-Robertson Wildli fe Restoration Act (hereinafter referred to as Pittman-Robertson), provides funding for states and territories to support projects that promote the conservation and restoration of wild birds and mammals and their habitats and programs that provide hunter education and safety training and opportunities. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), an agency within the Department of the Interior, administers Pittman-Robertson as part of its Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program. Revenues generated through excise taxes on pistols and revolvers, other firearms, ammunition, bows, and other archery equipment provide the funding for Pittman-Robertson. After collection, receipts from these excise taxes are deposited into the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Fund in the Treasury, and monies from the fund are made available for FWS for Pittman-Robertson activities in the fiscal year following their collection without any further action by Congress. For three programs within Pittman-Robertson, FWS apportions the funds directly among the states and territories. All 50 states as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (collectively referred to as territories in this report) are eligible to receive funding through Pittman-Robertson. Since its creation, Pittman-Robertson has provided over $18.8 billion (in 2018 dollars; $12.2 billion in nominal dollars) to states and territories. This report provides an overview of the Pittman-Robertson state and territory programs that support wildlife restoration and hunter education and safety activities, including a breakdown of the various apportionment formulas and an analysis of related issues that may be of interest to Congress. This report focuses on the formula-based programs within Pittman-Robertson that provide funding for states and territories.",
    "crs_98-505": "The exercise of emergency powers has long been a concern of the classical political theorists, including the 18th-century English philosopher John Locke, who had a strong influence upon the Founding Fathers in the United States. A preeminent exponent of a government of laws and not of men, Locke argued that occasions may arise when the executive must exert a broad discretion in meeting special exigencies or \"emergencies\" for which the legislative power provided no relief or existing law granted no necessary remedy. He did not regard this prerogative as limited to wartime or even to situations of great urgency. Nevertheless, Presidents have occasionally taken an emergency action that they assumed to be constitutionally permissible. Until the crisis of World War I, Presidents utilized emergency powers at their own discretion. Proclamations announced the exercise of exigency authority. During World War I and thereafter, Chief Executives had available to them a growing body of standby emergency authority that became operative upon the issuance of a proclamation declaring a condition of national emergency. Sometimes such proclamations confined the matter of crisis to a specific policy sphere, and sometimes they placed no limitation whatsoever on the pronouncement. These activations of standby emergency authority remained acceptable practice until the era of the Vietnam War. In 1976, Congress curtailed this practice with the passage of the National Emergencies Act. This report provides background and history on emergency powers, discusses the evolution of emergency powers, and provides a brief history of the exercise of these authorities.",
    "crs_R40425": "Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. The HI trust fund is mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers. Since 2013, workers with income of more than $200,000 per year for single tax filers (or more than $250,000 for joint tax filers) pay an additional 0.9% on income over those amounts. Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. The SMI trust fund is funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%). Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA) is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Individuals choosing to enroll in Part C must also enroll in Part B. Part C is funded through the HI and SMI trust funds. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Funding is included in the SMI trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfer payments. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and older. In 2019, the program will cover an estimated 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. About 28% of Medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services. CBO also estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be about $637 billion in 2019, accounting for about 14% of total federal spending and 3% of GDP. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process.",
    "crs_R45242": "Congress is currently considering reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for either a shorter or longer term, while the program is still dealing with the financial impact of the 2017 and 2018 hurricane seasons. Total losses (insured and uninsured) for the 2017 hurricane season are estimated at a record $273 billion, with losses for Hurricane Harvey estimated at $128.8 billion, Hurricane Maria at $92.7 billion, and Hurricane Irma at $51.5 billion. Total losses for the 2018 hurricane season are estimated at $49.4 billion, with Hurricane Florence at $24.2 billion and Hurricane Michael at $25.2 billion. NFIP claims for Harvey, Irma, and Maria amounted to more than $10.1 billion as of January 31, 2019, while NFIP claims for Florence and Michael amounted to more than $850 million as of that date. The NFIP is designed to borrow money from the Treasury to cover claims for extreme events; however, the 2017 losses would have pushed the program over its authorized borrowing limit. Rather than increase the borrowing limit, in 2017, Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP debt to allow the program to pay claims. Expanding the role of private insurers, including reinsurers, has been seen by many as an answer to the variability of the financial position of the NFIP. Increasing participation by private insurers could transfer more flood risk from policyholders to the private insurance sector, as opposed to transferring the risk to the federal government through the NFIP. In addition to the possible advantage to the NFIP, the increased availability of flood insurance as private companies enter the market may benefit households and businesses, as insured flood victims are likely to recover more quickly and more fully after a flood. Private insurer interest in directly providing and underwriting flood risk has increased in recent years. Advances in the analytics and data used to quantify flood risk along with increases in capital market capacities may allow private insurers to take on flood risks that they shunned in the past. However, increasing the private sector role in providing flood insurance coverage directly to consumers may have implications for the operations and fiscal solvency of the NFIP as currently structured. Increased access to private flood insurance could provide individual policyholders with a wider choice of coverage and possibly cheaper premiums, but may also lead to variable consumer protections. The extent to which private insurance companies participate in the U.S. flood insurance market represents an area of congressional concern. Both the 114th and 115th Congress addressed the issue with legislation passing the House; however, no legislation was ultimately enacted. The NFIP is currently operating under a short-term reauthorization until May 31, 2019. This report describes the current role of private insurers in U.S. flood insurance, and discusses barriers to private sector involvement. The report considers potential effects of increased private sector involvement in the U.S. flood market, both for the NFIP and for consumers. Finally, the report outlines the provisions relevant to private flood insurance in House and Senate NFIP reauthorization bills from the 115th Congress. It will be updated to reflect legislative developments in the 116th Congress, particularly focusing on private flood insurance.",

    "crs_R44804": "The existence and treatment of political prisoners in Burma (Myanmar) has been a central issue in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Burma for more than 25 years. The arrest, detention, prosecution, and imprisonment of Burmese political prisoners\u2014including Aung San Suu Kyi\u2014frequently were cited as reasons for imposing political and economic sanctions on Burma and the leaders of its ruling military junta. The release of political prisoners was often listed as a necessary condition for the repeal of those sanctions. When announcing waivers of existing sanctions, the Obama Administration often cited progress on the release of political prisoners as evidence for why the waiver was warranted. What actions, if any, the 116th Congress or the Trump Administration may take with respect to U.S. policy toward Burma may hinge, in part, on the issue of political prisoners in Burma. Eight years have passed since Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), transferred power over to a newly reconstituted Union Parliament and President Thein Sein, a retired general and the SPDC's last Prime Minister. In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy (NLD) assumed control over the Union Parliament after NLD's landslide victory in the 2015 parliamentary elections. Although both the Thein Sein and NLD-led governments periodically pardoned political prisoners, authorities continue to arrest, detain, prosecute, and imprison people for peacefully expressing their political opinions. One reason that controversy over political imprisonment persists in Burma is the lack of agreement on the definition of \"political prisoner.\" Some in Burma would restrict the definition to \"prisoners of conscience\"; others prefer a broader definition that would include persons who took up arms against the SPDC and the Burmese military. Efforts to forge an official definition for political prisoners during the Thein Sein government were unsuccessful. So far, the NLD-led government has made little progress on the definition issue. A second reason the issue of political imprisonment persists in Burma is the existence of many laws\u2014some dating back to the time of British colonial rule\u2014that restrict freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press. Various human rights organizations have identified Burmese laws that violate international standards on these freedoms. Because these laws remain in force, Burmese security personnel can arrest, detain, and prosecute people for their political views. Burma's courts have also shown a willingness to convict people for their political views. During the Thein Sein government, the Union Parliament made some progress on legal reform, but also passed new laws that some observers maintain restrict political expression. Since the NLD took control of the Union Parliament, little progress has been made on repealing or revising Burma's questionable laws. A third reason the issue of political imprisonment persists in Burma has to do with who holds administrative authority over Burma's criminal cases. All security forces in Burma\u2014including the military (or Tatmadaw), the Myanmar Police Force (MPF), the Border Guard Police, and local militias\u2014directly or indirectly report to the Tatmadaw's Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and not to President Win Myint or the Union Parliament. As a result, people will continue to be arrested for political expression, in accordance with existing Burmese laws, so long as Min Aung Hlaing supports such a policy. President Win Myint does have authority over the prosecution of criminal offenses and the power to grant amnesty to convicted criminals. If addressing political imprisonment remains a priority in U.S. policy toward Burma, then the 116th Congress and the Administration could consider several options, such as reimposing sanctions and restrictions previously waived, or providing assistance in repealing or revising problematic laws or the provisions in the 2008 constitution. However, it may be useful for such options to be evaluated in the context of and with consideration of the possible impact on other priorities in U.S. relations with Burma, including: the creation of a democratically elected civilian government in Burma; the protection of the human rights of the people of Burma; progress toward greater economic prosperity for the people of Burma; and the establishment of direct civilian control over the Tatmadaw and the rest of Burma's security forces.",

    "crs_R43325": "Established by Congress as an amendment to the Clean Air Act, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates that U.S. transportation fuels contain a minimum volume of biofuel. The mandated minimum volume increases annually and must be met using both conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol) and advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic ethanol). For a renewable fuel to be applied toward the mandate, it must be used for certain purposes (i.e., transportation fuel, jet fuel, or heating oil) and meet certain environmental and biomass feedstock criteria. A variety of factors, such as infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance, have led to challenges in meeting the total volume requirement established by Congress. These challenges have included a lack of cellulosic biofuel production and delays by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in approving fuel pathways. Further, it is not clear how changes in gasoline consumption in response to fluctuating crude oil and gasoline prices impact the biofuel or conventional fuel industries. It is also uncertain how the program will fare once EPA implements the \"reset\" provision of the statute, which allows the agency to modify the volumes required for future years (starting in 2016) if certain conditions are met. In addition, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the transparency of the market wherein credits are traded to demonstrate compliance with the mandate. Lastly, there is concern by some biofuel producers that the Trump Administration's issuance of multiple small refinery exemptions has adversely affected, or will adversely affect, biofuel demand. Small refiners may petition the EPA Administrator for an exemption from the RFS mandate if they can prove disproportionate economic hardship. There are, however, two fuel categories that have consistently met their statutory targets: conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel. Also, since 2014, two advanced biofuel pathways\u2014renewable compressed natural gas and renewable liquefied natural gas\u2014have constituted the majority of the cellulosic biofuel volume target established by EPA. Challenges in implementing the RFS have led to scrutiny of the program in Congress and to litigation about EPA's regulations. Largely due to concerns about the implementation and feasibility of the RFS, some Members of Congress have expressed their perspectives on EPA's proposed and final rules as well as EPA's implementation of the program. They also have questioned whether to amend or repeal the RFS or whether to maintain the status quo. This report provides a basic description of the RFS, including some of the widely discussed policy issues related to it.",

A vetoed bill can become law if two-thirds of the Members voting in each chamber agree, by recorded vote, a quorum being present, to repass the bill and thereby override the veto of the President. The chamber that originated the bill sent to the President acts first on the question of its reconsideration. In other words, the House acts first on vetoed bills that carry an \"H.R.\" or \"H.J. Res.\" designation, and the Senate acts first on vetoed bills that carry an \"S.\" or \"S.J. Res.\" designation. If the chamber of origin votes to repass the bill, then the bill with the veto message is transmitted to the second chamber, which then also reconsiders it. Nothing in the Constitution requires that either chamber vote directly on the question of repassing a vetoed bill. The chambers have, for example, referred a vetoed bill to committee instead. If either chamber fails to vote on the question of repassing the bill, then the measure dies at the end of the Congress. Both chambers will not necessarily even have a chance to take up the question. If two-thirds of the Members of the chamber of origin do not agree to override a veto, then the measure dies, and the other chamber does not have an opportunity to vote on the question of repassing the bill. The Constitution does not otherwise address how Congress should consider a vetoed bill, and it is therefore House and Senate rules and practices that additionally govern the treatment of bills vetoed and returned by the President.

    "crs_RL33865": "The United States has participated in numerous arms control and nonproliferation efforts over the past 60 years. These efforts have produced formal treaties and agreements that impose restrictions on U.S. military forces and activities, informal arrangements and guidelines that the United States has agreed to observe, and unilateral restraints on military forces and activities that the United States has adopted either on its own, or in conjunction with reciprocal restraints on other nations' forces and activities. Because these arms control arrangements affect U.S. national security, military programs, force levels, and defense spending, Congress has shown a continuing interest in the implementation of existing agreements and the prospects for further negotiations. The United States and Russia signed the 2010 New START Treaty, and have completed the implementation of its modest reductions, but there was little evidence of progress toward discussions on further reductions on nuclear weapons. President Obama also did not seek Senate advice and consent on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the Fissile Material Control Treaty remained stalled in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. Progress was also scant in President Obama's second term. Not only did the United States and Russia fail to negotiate further reductions in their offensive nuclear weapons, the United States highlighted concerns with Russia's compliance with past agreements. Specifically, the United States accused Russia of violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the 1992 Open Skies Treaty. Some have argued that these actions, when combined with Russia's annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine in early 2014, indicate that Russia may be rejecting the web of arms control and security agreements that have contributed to U.S., Russian, and European security for the past two decades. On the other hand, in 2015, the United States, Russia, and other nations reached an agreement with Iran that restricted Iran's nuclear program and introduced new, extensive international monitoring mechanisms to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. The debate in Congress over its provisions and implications revealed broad disagreement about the role and value of arms control and nonproliferation agreements in supporting U.S. national security. The Trump Administration, like the Bush Administration, has voiced skepticism about the role that arms control and nonproliferation agreements can play in strengthening U.S. national security. This view reflects growing concerns about Russian compliance with existing arms control agreements, but also derives from the view that arms control does too much to restrict U.S. flexibility and too little to limit the capabilities of others. Moreover, while some would argue that growing tensions between the United States and Russia strengthen the case for further negotiated limits on U.S. and Russian forces, the Trump Administration, and the Obama Administration in its later years, notes that Russia is not, at this time, willing to pursue such agreements. In response to these views, and after years of trying to convince Russia to return to compliance with the INF Treaty, the Trump Administration announced on February 1, 2019, that the United States was suspending its participation in INF and would withdraw on August 2, 2019, following the treaty-mandated six-month withdrawal period. Moreover, while President Trump's approach to diplomatic engagement with North Korea has raised hope for some resolution to the nuclear crisis with that country, the Trump Administration has withdrawn U.S. support for the agreement with Iran.",

    "crs_R45472": "Human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion and industrial operations, have raised the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) by about 40% over the past 150 years. Almost all climate scientists agree that these GHG increases have contributed to a warmer climate today and that, if they continue, will contribute to future climate change. Although a range of actions that seek to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway or being developed on the international and sub-national level (e.g., individual state actions or regional partnerships), federal policymakers and stakeholders have different viewpoints over what to do, if anything, about future climate change and related impacts. Congressional interest in GHG emission control legislation has fluctuated over the last 15 years. Proposals to limit GHG emissions have often focused on market-based approaches, such as a GHG emission cap-and-trade program or a GHG emissions tax (often referred to as a carbon tax) or fee. In general, a market-based approach would place a price on GHG emissions (e.g., through an emissions cap or emission tax or fee), allowing covered entities to determine their pathway of compliance. This report provides a comparison of the legislative proposals from the 108th through the 116th Congresses that were and are designed primarily to reduce GHG emissions using market-based approaches such as cap-and-trade or carbon tax/fee programs. During this time frame, Members introduced multiple energy-related proposals that would have likely resulted in reductions in GHG emissions\u2014legislation that promotes renewable energy or encourages carbon capture and sequestration\u2014but these bills are not discussed in this report. In addition, starting in the 112th Congress, some Members have introduced resolutions in the House and Senate expressing the view that a carbon tax is not in the economic interests of the United States. In September 2018, the House passed a resolution \"expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy\" (H.Con.Res. 119). An analogous resolution was not introduced in the Senate in the 115th Congress. The proposals from the 116th Congress range in their scope of emissions covered from CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion to multiple GHG emissions from a broader array of sources. In addition, the proposals differ by how, to whom, and for what purpose the fee revenues or allowance value would be applied. Some economic analyses indicate that policy choices to distribute the tax, fee, or emission allowance revenue would yield greater economic impacts than the direct impacts of the carbon price.",

These programs include loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. In recent years, congressional interest in these programs has increased, primarily because assisting small businesses is viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs.

The SBA administers many, but not all, of these programs. It examines the following federal requirements and authorities in promoting contracting and subcontracting with small businesses: 1. The requirement that federal agencies generally reserve contracts that have an anticipated value greater than the micro-purchase threshold (currently $10,000) but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) exclusively for small businesses unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small businesses that are competitive with market prices and the quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased. 2. The establishment of small business procurement goals, both government-wide and agency specific, to promote the awarding of contracts to small businesses. 3. The requirement that federal agencies generally set aside contracts that have an anticipated value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold exclusively for small businesses when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses offering the products of different small businesses (Rule of Two) and the award will be made at a fair market price. 4. The authority provided federal agencies to make sole source awards to small businesses when the award could not otherwise be made (e.g., only a single source is available, under urgent and compelling circumstances). 5. The authority provided federal agencies to set aside contracts for, or grant other contracting preference to, specific types of small businesses (e.g., 8(a) small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, WOSBs, and SDVOSBs). 6. The SBA's oversight and responsibilities concerning the small business goaling program, small business mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs, the 7(j) management and training program, and the surety bond guaranty program. 7.

While the President nominates persons to fill federal judgeships, the appointment of each nominee also requires Senate confirmation. Historically, the vast majority of appointments to federal judgeships (other than to the Supreme Court) have typically not involved much public disagreement between the President and the Senate or between the parties within the Senate. Debate in the Senate over particular lower court nominees, or over the lower court appointment process itself, was uncommon. Typically, such nominations were both reported out of the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the Senate without any recorded opposition. In recent decades, however, appointments to two kinds of lower federal courts\u2014the U.S. circuit courts of appeals and the U.S. district courts\u2014have often been the focus of heightened Senate interest and debate, as has the process itself for appointing judges to these courts.

    "crs_R45685": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides an avenue of legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment committed by professors, teachers, coaches, and others at educational institutions. The statute prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" of any person in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Though Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual abuse or harassment, the Supreme Court has held that a school district can violate the statute, and be held liable for damages, based on a deliberately indifferent response to a teacher's sexual abuse or harassment of a student. The Court has also held that a school board may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Meanwhile, federal agencies that administratively enforce the statute, such as the Department of Education (ED), have also determined that educational institutions can be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment under Title IX in certain circumstances. Title IX is thus primarily enforced in two ways: (1) through private rights of action directly against schools by or on behalf of students subject to such harassment in certain circumstances; and (2) by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. With respect to the latter enforcement prong, like several other federal civil rights statutes, Title IX makes compliance with its antidiscrimination mandate a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program or activity. With respect to the latter enforcement prong, like several other federal civil rights statutes, Title IX makes compliance with its antidiscrimination mandate a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program or activity. The text of Title IX does not expressly mention sexual abuse or harassment, while current regulations implementing the statute also do not explicitly address sexual harassment (although the regulations do require schools to designate at least one employee to function as a Title IX Coordinator). In each of the last several presidential administrations, however, the Department of Education (ED) has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities under Title IX when addressing allegations of sexual harassment. In response, educational institutions have developed procedures and practices to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual harassment and assault. And ED recently issued another notice of proposed rulemaking, after having revoked some of its prior guidance to schools in 2017. As discussed in this report, if adopted, the regulations would significantly change educational institutions' responsibilities for responding to sexual harassment allegations.",

    "crs_R45615": "International trophy hunting is a multinational, multimillion-dollar industry practiced in countries on almost every continent. Trophy hunting is broadly defined as the killing of animals for recreation with the purpose of collecting trophies such as horns, antlers, skulls, skins, tusks, or teeth for display. Trophy hunting generates millions of dollars each year through trophy fees and other revenue connected with associated tourism. The practice of international trophy hunting, especially of rare and endangered species, has generated controversy for a number of reasons, including its relation to conservation (including of wildlife populations), ethical considerations, and its effect on local economies where the animals are hunted. Proponents of trophy hunting contend that the practice is a potential source of funding for the conservation of species in exchange for the hunting of a proportionally small number of individuals. Further, they argue that trophy hunting can create incentives for conserving habitat and ecosystems where hunted animals roam and, in some impoverished areas in range countries, can provide a means of income, employment, and community development. Critics of trophy hunting contend that the practice can lead to the decline of rare and endangered species and that the pathway of moving funds from hunting to conservation can be fraught with corruption and mismanagement. Further, some argue that it is unethical to kill animals for sport and that the life of an animal should not be valued according to how much a hunter would pay to kill it. Congressional interest in trophy hunting hinges on several aspects of the practice and its potential consequences. There is interest among some Members of Congress and constituents in international trophy hunting of rare and threatened species, such as African lions, elephants, and rhinoceroses. As the largest importer of sport-hunted trophies in the world, the United States can play a role in shaping policy, which likely bolsters this interest. The killing of Cecil the lion in Africa in 2015 drew particular public interest and attention in Congress. The incident stimulated debate on trophy hunting and raised questions about the relative importance of trophy hunting versus other threats to a species. Congress's role in addressing international trophy hunting is limited in some aspects, because the range country oversees most controversial aspects of the activity. However, Congress can address the import of wildlife trophies into the United States and can use laws and regulations to indirectly influence trophy-hunting practices in range countries. Congress has addressed international trophy hunting through several bills and through oversight of the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition, some Trump Administration policies have stimulated congressional interest in trophy hunting, such as one to evaluate permits issued for importing sport-hunted trophies of listed animals into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a change from the previous practice of evaluating the range country before issuing permits for hunting these animals. Further, the Trump Administration established an International Wildlife Conservation Council, which is charged with providing advice to the Secretary of the Interior on the benefits of U.S. citizens hunting overseas.",

    "crs_R45030": "The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires that states follow certain voter registration requirements for federal elections. NVRA does not set requirements for state or local elections. The stated purposes of NVRA are to establish procedures to increase the number of eligible citizens registered to vote in federal elections; enable enhanced voter participation in federal elections; protect the integrity of the electoral process; and ensure accurate voter registration records. NVRA was not the first piece of federal legislation addressing state electoral activities, but it did create a more significant federal presence in voter registration activities. NVRA may be viewed as an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) and other federal legislation that sought to create uniformity across state electoral processes in order to expand voter enfranchisement and ensure constitutionally protected voter rights. NVRA is sometimes referred to as the motor-voter bill, since one of its provisions requires that eligible citizens must be able to simultaneously apply for voter registration when they apply within a state for a motor vehicle driver's license or other personal identification document issued by a state department of motor vehicles. In addition to these motor-voter registration opportunities, NVRA requires that states establish mail-based voter registration processes and accept a federal mail-in registration form. States must also provide in-person voter registration opportunities at the designated, residence-based voter registration sites, in accordance with state law, and at designated federal, state, or nongovernmental offices, including state agencies providing public assistance or services to persons with disabilities. In addition to voter registration methods, NVRA included procedural requirements for states to follow when performing voter registration list maintenance or when adding, removing, or modifying records for registered voters. NVRA further required that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) provide guidance to the states for implementing NVRA. NVRA also directed the FEC to publish a biennial election report assessing the impact of the act on federal election administration and offering recommendations for improvements to federal and state procedures, forms, and other matters affected by NVRA. These FEC responsibilities were transferred to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) following enactment of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in 2002. NVRA, as amended by HAVA, provides much of the framework for federal voter registration policy. The first portion of this report provides a brief background on the federal role in voter registration and the passage of NVRA, followed by a discussion of the key components of NVRA. The implementation of NVRA, subsequent modifications to its provisions, and ongoing considerations related to federal voter registration are also discussed.

King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein (hereinafter King Abdullah II) has ruled the country since 1999, when he succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father, the late King Hussein, after a 47-year reign. Educated largely in Britain and the United States, King Abdullah II had earlier pursued a military career, ultimately serving as commander of Jordan's Special Operations Forces with the rank of major general. The king's son, Prince Hussein bin Abdullah (born in 1994), is the designated crown prince. The king appoints the prime minister and may dismiss him or accept his resignation. He also has the sole power to appoint the crown prince, senior military leaders, justices of the constitutional court, and all 75 members of the senate, as well as cabinet ministers. The king also can issue royal decrees, which are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The king commands the armed forces, declares war, and ratifies treaties. Jordan's geographic position, wedged between Israel, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, has made it vulnerable to the strategic designs of its powerful neighbors, but has also given Jordan an important role as a buffer between these countries in their largely adversarial relations with one another.

    "crs_R45283": "The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA) provided civil protections and rights to individuals based on their service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Congress enacted the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) in 2003 in response to the increased deployment of Reserve and National Guard military and as a modernization and restatement of the protections and rights previously available to servicemembers under the SSCRA. The SCRA has been amended since its initial passage, and Congress continues to consider amendments from time to time. Most recently, Congress has enacted amendments to extend certain benefits to the spouses of servicemembers. Congress has long recognized the need for protective legislation for servicemembers whose service to the nation compromises their ability to meet obligations and protect their legal interests. For example, Congress tolled all judicial actions during the Civil War, civil and criminal, for persons who \"by reason of resistance to the execution of the laws of the United States, or the interruption of the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,\" were beyond the reach of legal process. During World War I, Congress passed the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1918, which, unlike many state laws of the Civil War era, did not create a moratorium on legal actions against servicemembers, but instead directed trial courts to apply principles of equity to determine the appropriate action to take whenever a servicemember's rights were implicated in a controversy. During World War II, Congress essentially reenacted the expired 1918 statute as the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, and then amended it substantially in 1942 to take into account the new economic and legal landscape that had developed between the wars. Congress enacted amendments to the SSCRA on several occasions during subsequent conflicts, including in 2002, when the benefits of the SSCRA were extended to certain members of the National Guard. The SCRA protects servicemembers by temporarily suspending certain judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect their legal rights during military service. The SCRA does not provide forgiveness of all debts or the extinguishment of contractual obligations on behalf of active-duty servicemembers, nor grant absolute immunity from civil lawsuits. Instead, the SCRA provides for the suspension of claims and protection from default judgments against servicemembers. In this way, it seeks to balance the interests of servicemembers and their creditors, spreading the burden of national military service to a broader portion of the citizenry. Courts are to construe the SCRA liberally in favor of servicemembers, but retain discretion to deny relief in certain cases. Many of the SCRA provisions are especially beneficial for Reservists activated to respond to a national crisis, but some provisions are also useful for career military personnel. One measure that affects many who are called to active duty is the cap on interest at an annual rate of 6% on debts incurred prior to a person's entry into active-duty military service. Other measures protect military families from being evicted from rental or mortgaged property; from cancellation of life insurance; from taxation in multiple jurisdictions; from foreclosure of property to pay taxes that are due; and from losing certain rights to public land.

The damages caused by the hurricanes are some of the worst in the history of the United States in terms of lives lost and property damaged and destroyed. The federal government played a significant role in the response to the hurricanes and Congress appropriated funds for a wide range of activities and efforts to help the Gulf Coast states recover and rebuild from the storms. In addition, Congress appropriated a significant amount of funds for mitigation activities and projects to reduce or eliminate the impacts of future storms. Though the storms happened over a decade ago, Congress remains interested in the types and amounts of federal assistance that were provided to the Gulf Coast for several reasons. For one, Congress continues to be interested in how the money has been spent, what resources have been provided to the region, and whether the money has reached the people and entities intended to receive the funds. The financial information is also useful for congressional oversight and evaluation of the federal entities that were responsible for response and recovery operations. Similarly, it gives Congress a general idea of the federal assets that are needed and can be brought to bear when catastrophic disasters take place in the United States.

    "crs_R45557": "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is an international trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that became effective on January 1, 1994. The agreement includes market-opening provisions that remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as other rules affecting trade in areas such as agriculture, customs procedures, foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property protection, and trade in services. The United States approved NAFTA as a congressional-executive agreement by a majority vote of each house of Congress, rather than as a treaty ratified by the President after Senate approval by a two-thirds majority vote. It was not a self-executing agreement; rather, implementing legislation was required to provide domestic legal authorities with the power to enforce and comply with the agreement's provisions. Congress approved and implemented NAFTA in domestic law in the NAFTA Implementation Act. Although many U.S. obligations under NAFTA were already implemented in domestic law prior to Congress's enactment of the NAFTA Implementation Act, Congress delegated rulemaking authority to the President and various federal agencies in the Act so that they could further implement NAFTA in domestic law by promulgating executive orders, proclamations, or regulations. The NAFTA implementing legislation contemplates certain limited changes to certain provisions of NAFTA (e.g., certain rules of origin) in accordance with NAFTA's rules for minor amendments to the text of the agreement and limited congressional delegations of authority to the President to implement such changes in U.S. law. On May 18, 2017, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Robert Lighthizer notified Congress that the Administration intended to renegotiate NAFTA. More than a year later, following the conclusion of the negotiations, President Trump signed a proposed replacement for NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA), along with his counterparts from Canada and Mexico. The new agreement addressed a variety of issues, including changes to rules of origin for automotive trade; intellectual property rights protections; digital trade; limitations on the scope of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions; and certain provisions on agricultural trade. President Trump has at times suggested that he will withdraw the United States from NAFTA unilaterally if Congress does not approve the USMCA. If the President sought to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, an injured business or other party with standing to bring a lawsuit might seek an injunction from a U.S. federal court directing the executive branch to refrain from issuing a notice terminating U.S. obligations under NAFTA or a declaration from the court that such issuance is unlawful. It is difficult to predict how a court might resolve such a challenge, as U.S. courts have uniformly avoided answering whether the U.S. Constitution authorizes the President to terminate an international pact without express congressional approval. Instead, courts have left the executive and legislative branches to resolve disagreements over the termination power through the political process. While no court has considered a case involving a trade agreement approved as a congressional-executive agreement under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures, there is a significant possibility that a court would dismiss such a case for lack of jurisdiction. Congress could signal that it disputes the Executive's termination of U.S. NAFTA obligations to a court by enacting a law or resolution with a veto-proof majority opposing or purporting to block such action. If Congress passed such an act or resolution and the Executive still terminated NAFTA in direct derogation of that act or resolution, the legal paradigm governing the separation-of-powers analysis might shift. To resolve certain separation-of-powers conflicts, the Supreme Court typically applies the approach set forth in Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, which states that the President's constitutional powers often \"are not fixed but fluctuate, depending on their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.\" In the absence of guidance from the text or original meaning of the Constitution, a court considering whether the President has the constitutional authority to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA without congressional approval would likely turn to other methods of constitutional interpretation. Because Congress has not enacted a resolution or legislation disapproving of unilateral NAFTA termination, in order to terminate NAFTA without further congressional action, either (1) the President must possess plenary constitutional authority to terminate U.S. international obligations under NAFTA, or (2) Congress must have authorized the President to take such action through",

Federal funds were provided through annual appropriations under a state-by-state allocation formula contained in the act itself. States used their allotments to make grants to cities to build or upgrade wastewater treatment plants, supporting the overall objectives of the act: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The federal share of project costs, originally 75% under P.L. 92-500, was reduced to 55% in 1981. By the mid-1980s, there was considerable policy debate between Congress and the Administration over the future of the act's construction grants program and, in particular, the appropriate federal role in funding municipal water infrastructure projects. Through FY1984, Congress had appropriated nearly $41 billion under this program, representing the largest nonmilitary public works programs since the Interstate Highway System. The grants program was a target of budget cuts in the Reagan Administration, which sought to redirect budgetary priorities in part to sort out the appropriate roles of federal, state, and local governments in a number of domestic policy areas, including water pollution control. The Administration's rationale included several points: The original intent of the program to address the backlog of sewage treatment needs had been virtually eliminated by the mid-1980s. Most remaining projects (such as small, rural systems) were believed to pose little environmental threat and were not appropriate federal responsibilities. State and local governments, in the Administration's view, were fully capable of running construction programs and have a clear responsibility to construct treatment capacity to meet environmental objectives that were primarily established by states. Thus, the Reagan Administration sought a phaseout of the act's construction grants program by 1990. Many states and localities supported the idea of phasing out the grants program, since many were critical of what they viewed as burdensome rules and regulations that accompanied the federal grant money. However, they sought a longer transition and ample flexibility to set up long-term financing to promote state and local self-sufficiency. The CWA amendments authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction, through a combination of the Title II grants program and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program\u2014hereinafter the clean water state revolving fund (CWSRF) program\u2014hereinafter the clean water state revolving fund (CWSRF) program. Under the new program, in CWA Title VI, federal grants would be provided as seed money for state-administered loans to build sewage treatment plants and, eventually, other water quality projects. Cities, in turn, would repay loans to the state, enabling a phaseout of federal involvement while the state built up a source of capital for future investments. Under the amendments, the CWSRF program was phased in beginning in FY1989 (in FY1989 and FY1990, appropriations were split equally between Title II and Title VI grants) and entirely replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. The intention was that states would have flexibility to set priorities and administer funding, while federal aid would end after FY1994. The CWSRF authorizations for appropriations provided in the 1987 amendments expired in FY1994, but pressure to extend federal funding has continued, in part because, although Congress has appropriated $98 billion in CWA Title II and Title VI wastewater infrastructure assistance since 1972, funding needs remain high: According to the most recent formal estimate by EPA and states (prepared in 2016), an additional $271 billion nationwide is needed over the next 20 years for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act. Congress has continued to appropriate funds, and continued to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water occurred for several reasons. First, until the 1980s, the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small, and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations. Second, good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively low cost. By comparison, essentially all communities have had to construct or upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the CWA. Over time, drinking water circumstances changed, as communities grew and commercial, industrial,",

The Chief Counsel and Advocacy support the development and growth of American small businesses by \"intervening early in federal agencies' regulatory development processes on proposals that affect small entities and providing Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance training to federal agency policymakers and regulatory development officials; producing research to inform policymakers and other stakeholders on the impact of federal regulatory burdens on small businesses, to document the vital role of small businesses in the economy, and to explore and explain the wide variety of issues of concern to the small business community; and fostering a two-way communication between federal agencies and the small business community.\" Advocacy has 55 staff members and received an appropriation of $9.120 million for FY2019. Advocacy's responsibilities have expanded over time, and legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses to increase its authority still further. For example, during the 115th Congress, the House passed H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (Title III, Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act), by a vote of 238-183. The bill would have, among other provisions, revised and enhanced requirements for federal agency notification of the Chief Counsel prior to the publication of any proposed rule; expanded the required use of small business advocacy review panels from three federal agencies to all federal agencies, including independent regulatory agencies; empowered the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the RFA; specifically authorized the Chief Counsel to file comments on any notice of proposed rulemaking, not just when the RFA is concerned; and transferred size standard determinations for purposes other than the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 from the SBA's Administrator to the Chief Counsel. During the 113th Congress, these provisions were included in H.R. 2542, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013, and were later included in H.R. 2804, the Achieving Less Excess in Regulation and Requiring Transparency Act of 2014 (ALERRT Act of 2014), which the House passed on February 27, 2014, and in H.R. 4, the Jobs for America Act (of 2014), which the House passed on September 18, 2014.

More recently, S. 83, the Advocacy Empowerment Act of 2019, would empower the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the RFA. In addition, during the 114th Congress, S. 2847, the Prove It Act of 2016, which was reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, would have authorized the Chief Counsel to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to review any federal agency certification that a proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, is not required to submit a regulatory flexibility analysis of the rule.

The original Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress was constituted during the 79th Congress (1945-1946) for the purpose of strengthening the role of Congress and its committees in the lawmaking process. In 1965, Congress reincarnated this joint committee to suggest additional changes in how the two chambers operate, and the committee was reconstituted during the 102nd and 103rd Congresses (1991-1994).

    "crs_R45547": "The United States has long been a major contributor of foreign assistance to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 1946 and 2017, the United States provided the region with more than $88 billion ($181 billion in constant 2017 dollars) of assistance. U.S. assistance spiked in the early 1960s following the introduction of President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, an anti-poverty initiative that sought to counter Soviet and Cuban influence in the aftermath of Fidel Castro's 1959 seizure of power in Cuba. After a period of decline, U.S. assistance to the region increased again following the 1979 assumption of power by the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Throughout the 1980s, the United States provided considerable support to Central American governments battling leftist insurgencies to prevent potential Soviet allies from establishing political or military footholds in the region. U.S. aid levels have rebounded since FY2014, largely due to a renewed focus on Central America in response to recent migration trends, but appropriations remain below the FY2008-FY2013 average. The Trump Administration requested $1.1 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean through foreign assistance accounts managed by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in FY2019. That amount would have been $581 million, or 34%, less than the estimated $1.7 billion of assistance Congress appropriated for the region in FY2018. The Administration also proposed eliminating the Inter-American Foundation\u2014a small, independent U.S. foreign assistance agency that promotes grassroots development in Latin America and the Caribbean\u2014and consolidating its programs into USAID. The proposed reductions for the region were slightly greater than the 28% reduction proposed for the global foreign aid budget. Congress ultimately did not adopt many of the Administration's proposed cuts. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request would have reduced funding for nearly every country and regional program in Latin America and the Caribbean. The request included $435.5 million to continue the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, which would have been a $191 million (30%) cut compared with the FY2018 estimate. The request included $252.8 million for the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), $45.7 million for El Salvador, $69.4 million for Guatemala (-42%), $65.8 million for Honduras (-18%), and $1.8 million combined for Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama (-82%). It did not include any democracy assistance to support civil society groups in Nicaragua; such assistance totaled $10 million in FY2018.

    "crs_R45720": "U.S. foreign intelligence relations are a component of U.S. international relations that involve cooperation between a U.S. and a foreign state or non-state intelligence service over an area of mutual interest. This cooperation may include simple liaison to discuss or exchange information, raw data, or finished intelligence. Intelligence liaison leverages the relative strengths of the interested intelligence services to provide tactical, operational, or strategic insight and perspective to provide warning of attack, corroboration of national sources, or additional, possibly unique, intelligence that the other service lacks. Other forms of cooperation include basing rights to enhance the range of U.S. collection coverage, joint operations and collection from the sovereign territory of a foreign state, and training to improve the capacity and professionalism of a foreign intelligence service. In areas of the world where the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) has few national intelligence assets, cooperative relations with a foreign intelligence service based in the region can effectively increase the range of U.S. intelligence coverage by using the partner's source network and linguistic, political, and cultural expertise. Although the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) provides the policy and criteria, and conducts oversight for all IC element intelligence relationships with foreign intelligence services, the IC elements themselves have the statutory authority to enter into agreements with foreign counterparts. Normally every relationship is formalized through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other written agreement. This report provides a historic perspective of traditional and nontraditional foreign intelligence partnerships with the U.S. It also discusses their risks and benefits in the context of the broader public discussion over the sorts of relationships the United States should have with various actors in the international community. In many\u2014but not all\u2014instances, intelligence relations with a foreign partner may be viewed as an approximate reflection of the strategic condition of the relationship between the U.S. and that partner generally. They indicate shared interests and a degree of trust in the professional ability of the partner to provide credible intelligence while protecting sources and maintaining security about the nature and extent of the relationship. In discussing risk, this report emphasizes the risk to the United States. However, foreign partners also bear risk (e.g., relying too heavily on U.S. intelligence, or having their sensitive sources compromised). Congress has a vested interest in understanding the nature and scope of the IC's relations with foreign intelligence services. Congress has expressed both confidence in the value of these relationships and reservations. When the IC reduced national intelligence collection resources in the 1970s and the 1990s and the IC became heavily dependent upon intelligence obtained from foreign partners, Congress intervened to rebalance national intelligence collection with collection from foreign partners. Congress was also critical of deficiencies in the IC's ability to assess independently the credibility of foreign intelligence sources, one of whom fabricated reporting on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, one reason cited by the Bush Administration for invading Iraq in 2003. Most recently, Congress has expressed interest in the vulnerability of foreign intelligence partners' telecommunications technology to penetration by hostile intelligence services.",
    "crs_R45500": "The nation's air, land, and marine transportation systems are designed for accessibility and efficiency, two characteristics that make them vulnerable to attack. The difficulty and cost of protecting the transportation sector from attack raises a core question for policymakers: how much effort and resources to put toward protecting potential targets versus pursuing and fighting terrorists. While hardening the transportation sector against terrorist attack is difficult, measures can be taken to deter terrorists. The focus of debate is how best to implement and finance a system of deterrence, protection, and response that effectively reduces the possibility and consequences of terrorist attacks without unduly interfering with travel, commerce, and civil liberties. For all modes of transportation, one can identify four principal policy objectives that would support a system of deterrence and protection: (1) ensuring the trustworthiness of the passengers and the cargo flowing through the system; (2) ensuring the trustworthiness of the transportation workers who operate and service the vehicles, assist the passengers, or handle the cargo; (3) ensuring the trustworthiness of the private companies that operate in the system, such as the carriers, shippers, agents, and brokers; and (4) establishing a perimeter of security around transportation facilities and vehicles in operation. The first three policy objectives are concerned with preventing an attack from within a transportation system, such as occurred on September 11, 2001. The concern is that attackers could once again disguise themselves as legitimate passengers (or shippers or workers) to get in position to launch an attack. The fourth policy objective is concerned with preventing an attack from outside a transportation system. For instance, terrorists could ram a bomb-laden speedboat into an oil tanker, as was done in October 2002 to the French oil tanker Limberg, or they could shoot a shoulder-fired missile at an airplane taking off or landing, as was attempted in November 2002 against an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa, Kenya. Achieving all four of these objectives is difficult at best, and in some modes, is practically impossible. Where limited options exist for preventing an attack, policymakers are left with evaluating options for minimizing the consequences of an attack, without imposing unduly burdensome requirements. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation has taken a number of steps to improve the capability to detect concealed explosives and bomb-making components carried by airline passengers. The TSA Modernization Act, incorporated into the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), includes language directing TSA to streamline the contracting process for private screening at airports, and directs TSA to look into the feasibility of modifying the program to allow individual airport terminals, instead of entire airports, to switch over to screening by private contractors. Proposals seeking more extensive reforms of passenger screening have not been extensively debated. Rather, aviation security legislation has largely focused on specific mandates to comprehensively screen for explosives and carry out background checks and threat assessments. Despite the extensive focus on aviation security for more than a decade, a number of challenges remain, including effectively screening passengers, baggage, and cargo for explosives threats; developing effective risk-based methods for screening passengers and others with access to aircraft and sensitive areas; incorporating biometrics into the passenger screening process to verify identities; exploiting available intelligence information and watchlists to identify individuals who pose potential threats to civil aviation; implementing effective systems, regulations, and international agreements to assess risk and conduct risk-based screening of air cargo shipments worldwide; effectively deterring and responding to security threats in public areas of airports and at screening checkpoints; developing effective strategies for addressing aircraft vulnerabilities to shoulder-fired missiles and other standoff weapons; and addressing the potential security implications of unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace and developing effective countermeasures to protect critical infrastructure, including airports and aircraft, from attacks using drones.",

The H-2B program is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of State (DOS). The H-2B program is subject to an annual statutory numerical limit. Under the INA, as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990, the total number of aliens who may be issued H-2B visas or otherwise provided with H-2B nonimmigrant status in any fiscal year may not exceed 66,000. Also, since FY2006 there has been a cap of 33,000 on the number of aliens subject to H-2B numerical limits who may enter the United States on an H-2B visa or be granted H-2B status during the first six months of a fiscal year. This INA amendment effectively divided the annual H-2B cap of 66,000 into two semiannual caps of 33,000, respectively covering work in the first and second halves of the fiscal year. Certain categories of H-2B workers are exempt from the cap, including the following: current H-2B workers seeking an extension of stay, change of employer, or change in the terms of employment; H-2B workers previously counted toward the cap in any one of the three prior fiscal years; fish roe processors, fish roe technicians, and/or supervisors of fish roe processing; and H-2B workers performing labor in the U.S. territories of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and/or Guam until December 31, 2029. As noted, spouses and children who are accompanying H-2B workers are issued H-4 visas and, as such, are not counted against the H-2B cap. For FY2017 and FY2018, a different type of H-2B cap-related provision was enacted by the 115th Congress. For each of these years, provisions in year-end omnibus appropriations laws authorized DHS to make additional H-2B visas available beyond the statutory cap after consultation with DOL and \"upon the determination that the needs of American businesses cannot be satisfied\" with available U.S. workers. Under these provisions, the number of additional aliens who could receive H-2B visas each year was limited to \"not more than the highest number of H\u20132B nonimmigrants who participated in the H\u20132B returning worker program in any fiscal year in which returning workers were exempt from such numerical limitation.\" The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes a provision of the same type for FY2019. Using the same language as the FY2017 and FY2018 provisions, the FY2019 provision authorizes DHS, after consultation with DOL and \"upon the determination that the needs of American businesses cannot be satisfied\" with available U.S. workers, to make additional H-2B visas available for FY2019 up to a maximum of \"the highest number of H\u20132B nonimmigrants who participated in the H\u20132B returning worker program in any fiscal year in which returning workers were exempt from such numerical limitation.\" The FY2019 provision temporarily amends DHS H-2B regulations to state that for FY2019, DHS has authorized the issuance of up to 30,000 additional H-2B visas. As it did in the supplementary information to the FY2017 and FY2018 rules, DHS clarifies in the supplementary information to the FY2019 rule that the FY2019 provision only authorizes DHS to increase the number of H-2B visas; it does not cover individuals in the United States who change to H-2B status.

    "crs_R45415": "Many observers consider sanctions to be a central element of U.S. policy to counter Russian malign behavior. This includes Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, election interference and cyberattacks, human rights abuses, illicit trade with North Korea, support to the government of Syria, and use of a chemical weapon. The United States also employs sanctions in an effort to deter further objectionable activities by Russia (e.g., expanding the war in Ukraine or launching new attacks in neighboring countries). Most Members of Congress support a robust use of sanctions amid concerns about Russia's international behavior and geostrategic intentions. The United States has imposed most Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia in coordination with the European Union (EU). As the invasion of Ukraine progressed in 2014, the Obama Administration argued that EU support for sanctions was crucial, as the EU has more extensive trade and investment ties with Russia than does the United States. Many view U.S.-EU cooperation in imposing sanctions as a tangible indication of U.S.-European solidarity, frustrating Russian efforts to drive a wedge between transatlantic partners. Since 2017, the efforts of Congress and the Trump Administration to tighten U.S. sanctions unilaterally have prompted some degree of concern in the EU about U.S. commitment to sanctions coordination and U.S.-EU cooperation on Russia and Ukraine more broadly. The United States imposes sanctions on Russia in accordance with several laws and executive orders. In 2012, the United States introduced a new sanctions regime on Russia in response to human rights abuses. In 2014, the United States introduced an extensive new sanctions regime on Russia in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities for election interference. In 2017, Congress introduced and the President signed into law legislation that strengthened existing sanctions authorities and established several new sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, malicious cyber-enabled activities, human rights abuses, and corruption. The United States also has imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities in response to the use of a chemical weapon, weapons proliferation, trade with North Korea in violation of U.N. Security Council requirements, support for the Syrian government, transnational crime, and terrorism.

For most of the 19th century, U.S. law included language explicitly assigning the Secretary of the Navy the task of naming new Navy ships. The reference to the Secretary of the Navy disappeared from the U.S. Code in 1925. The code today (10 U.S.C. 8662) is silent on the issue of who has the authority to name new Navy ships, but the Secretary of the Navy arguably retains implicit authority, given the location of Section 8662 in subtitle C of Title 10, which covers the Navy and Marine Corps. On July 13, 2012, the Navy submitted to Congress a 73-page report on the Navy's policies and practices for naming ships. The report was submitted in response to Section 1014 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1540/P.L. 112-81 of December 31, 2011). The executive summary of the Navy's report is reprinted here as Appendix A.

The military has dissolved Morsi's government, suspended the constitution that had been passed during his rule, and installed an interim president. The Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters declared the military's actions a coup d'etat and protested in the streets. Weeks later, Egypt's military and national police launched a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood, resulting in police and army soldiers firing live ammunition against demonstrators encamped in several public squares and the killing of at least 1,150 demonstrators. The Egyptian military justified these actions by decrying the encampments as a threat to national security. Egypt's parliament is currently considering whether to adopt a package of draft constitutional amendments that would extend presidential term limits and executive branch control over the judiciary. If Egypt's 2019 constitutional amendments are approved, President Sisi will attain unprecedented power in the political system over the military and the judiciary and, if reelected, will have the potential to remain in office until 2034. He has inserted his older brother and oldest son into key security and intelligence positions while stymying all opposition to his rule and criticism of his government. This consolidation of power and crackdown against dissent has taken place during a period of steady economic growth, which has not benefitted wide swaths of the population.

    "crs_R41705": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the federal government charged with performing and supporting biomedical and behavioral research. It has major roles in training biomedical researchers and disseminating health information. The NIH mission is \"to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.\" As of FY2018, NIH was the largest single public funder of biomedical research in the world. Congress maintains a high level of interest in NIH for a variety of reasons. NIH funds extramural researchers in every state, and widespread constituencies contact Congress about funding for particular diseases and levels of research support in general. NIH is the largest and most visible contributor to the federal biomedical research effort; it represents about half of federal spending for non-Department of Defense research and development (R&D) and about one-fifth of total federal R&D funding. It has the largest budget of the eight health-related agencies that make up the Public Health Service (PHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In FY2018, discretionary appropriations to NIH constituted about 40% of all HHS discretionary budget authority. NIH-funded research has contributed to major scientific advances. To date, 156 NIH-funded researchers have received Nobel Prizes for their work. NIH-funded research has led to major medical innovations such as treatments for heart disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. Such advances have been credited with helping increase life expectancy and prevent millions of deaths. However, in light of the high cost of new medical innovations, some question whether NIH priorities are too focused on research that leads to new treatments rather than on disease prevention or improving the value of medical care. The allocation of NIH research dollars is a major source of debate. NIH has seen periods of both low and high funding growth. From FY1998 to FY2003, Congress doubled the NIH budget over a five-year period, from $13.7 billion to $27.1 billion. The agency then saw low funding growth or cuts from FY2004 to FY2015. From FY2016 through FY2019, Congress provided NIH with funding increases of over 5% each year, increasing funding from $30.3 billion in FY2015 to $39.3 billion in FY2019. Under President Trump's budget request for FY2020, NIH would be provided a program level of $34.3 billion\u2014a 12.6% reduction from the FY2019 program level. Some members of the scientific community have cited funding variability and uncertainty as a hindrance for advancing biomedical research. They have called for steady and predictable funding growth to support the multiyear nature of research. Others have questioned whether universities and other research institutions are too reliant on NIH funding and if institutions should diversify their funding sources or use institutional funds to pay for research. Aside from funding, other potential issues of for many in Congress and the research community may include allocating funding across disease types, areas of human health, and types of research; addressing congressional priorities and concerns, while ensuring the scientific merit and quality of NIH-funded research; helping new and early-stage investigators obtain their first independent research grants; maintaining the United States' role as a leader in biomedical research; balancing the public and private sectors' relative roles in biomedical research. This report provides background and analysis on NIH organization, mission, budget, and history; outlines the agency's major responsibilities; and discusses some of the issues facing Congress as it works to guide and monitor the nation's investment in medical research.",

The federal government, though, seeks to influence states' juvenile justice systems through the administration of grant programs and the provision of funds. This report provides a brief overview of funding for the juvenile justice-related grant programs administered by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). The JJDPA as originally enacted had three main components: (1) it established OJJDP to coordinate and administer federal juvenile justice efforts; (2) it created grant programs to assist states with their juvenile justice systems; and (3) it promulgated core mandates to which states must adhere in order to be eligible for certain grant funding. Although the JJDPA has been amended several times over the past 40 years, it continues to feature these three components. The JJDPA has been the primary channel through which the federal government has provided juvenile justice funding to states. However, other programs also administered by OJJDP have contributed to overall federal juvenile justice funding. The following section outlines various juvenile justice grant programs, including those authorized by the JJDPA. Grants noted in this section have been congressionally authorized at some point in time and have received an appropriation at least once since FY2010.

Obligated parties, such as refiners or importers of gasoline or diesel fuel, are responsible for complying with the RFS requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the mandate, which is an amendment to Clean Air Act (CAA) provisions governing the regulation of fuels. The statutory renewable fuel volume increases annually until 2022, with EPA determining the volume after 2022 within certain limitations. In general, EPA has the authority to waive the RFS requirements, in whole or in part, if certain conditions outlined in statute prevail. The RFS is a complex and highly technical policy initiative. It deals with multiple sectors of the economy and requires the use of some advanced renewable fuel production technologies that have yet to reach maturity. The RFS also incorporates thresholds for greenhouse gas emission reduction. This complexity is exacerbated by multiple stakeholders with differing perspectives on what the RFS should accomplish, how it should be implemented, and whether it should exist, which leads to debate about the RFS and its future. Congressional debate about the RFS is expected to continue with special attention to how EPA administers the program. As Congress continues its oversight of the RFS, it may be useful to understand the RFS waiver authority granted to EPA. This report discusses the waiver provisions of the RFS, including the modification-of-applicable-volumes (\"reset\") section. The RFS provisions of the CAA contain a set of waiver provisions. The provisions contain three separate waivers\u2014a general waiver, a cellulosic biofuel waiver, and a biomass-based diesel waiver\u2014that the EPA Administrator may use to waive, in whole or in part, the volume of renewable fuel mandated by statute. The waivers referred to in this report should not be confused with small refinery exemptions. If a waiver is issued, it expires after one year (60 days for the biomass-based diesel waiver), unless the Administrator renews the waiver. Additionally, starting in 2016, the waiver provision allows for a modification of applicable volumes. The waivers and the modification of applicable volumes are described in further detail in this report.",

It was established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or \"Communications Act\") and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms (except when filling an unexpired term). The President designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party as the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The FCC is funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. The FCC annually collects and retains regulatory fees to offset costs incurred by the agency and to carry out its functions. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities (e.g., cable television systems).

    "crs_R45631": "The protection of personal data has emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. Despite the increased interest in data protection, the legal paradigms governing the security and privacy of personal data are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution provides various rights protecting individual privacy, but these rights generally guard only against government intrusions and do little to prevent private actors from abusing personal data online. At the federal statutory level, while there are a number of data protection statutes, they primarily regulate certain industries and subcategories of data. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fills in some of the statutory gaps by enforcing the federal prohibition against unfair and deceptive data protection practices. But no single federal law comprehensively regulates the collection and use of personal data. In contrast to the \"patchwork\" nature of federal law, some state and foreign governments have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation. Some analysts suggest these laws, which include the European Union's (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and state laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), will create increasingly overlapping and uneven data protection regimes. This fragmented legal landscape coupled with concerns that existing federal laws are inadequate has led many stakeholders to argue that the federal government should assume a larger role in data protection policy. However, at present, there is no consensus as to what, if any, role the federal government should play, and any legislative efforts at data protection are likely to implicate unique legal concerns such as preemption, standing, and First Amendment rights, among other issues. This report examines the current U.S. legal landscape governing data protection, contrasting the current patchwork of federal data protection laws with the more comprehensive regulatory models in the CCPA and GDPR. The report also examines potential legal considerations for the 116th Congress should it consider crafting more comprehensive federal data protection legislation.

    "crs_R45661": "Since 2002, Canada has been the United States' top agricultural export market. Mexico was the second-largest export market until 2010, when China displaced Mexico as the second-leading market with Mexico becoming the third-largest U.S. agricultural export market. In FY2018, U.S. agricultural exports tashed $143 billion, of which Canada and Mexico jointly accounted for about 27%. USDA's Economic Research Service estimates that in 2017 each dollar of U.S. agricultural exports stimulated an additional $1.30 in business activity in the United States. That same year, U.S. agricultural exports generated an estimated 1,161,000 full-time civilian jobs, including 795,000 jobs outside the farm sector. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico are an important part of the U.S. economy, and the growth of these markets is partly the result of the North American market liberalization under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On September 30, 2018, the Trump Administration announced an agreement with Canada and Mexico for a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that would possibly replace NAFTA. NAFTA entered into force on January 1, 1994, following the passage of the implementing legislation by Congress (P.L. 103-182). NAFTA was structured as three separate bilateral agreements: one between Canada and the United States, a second between Mexico and the United States, and a third between Canada and Mexico. Provisions of the Canada-U.S. Trade Agreement (CUSTA), which went into effect on January 1, 1989, continued to apply under NAFTA. The agricultural provisions agreed upon for CUSTA remained in force as provisions of the new NAFTA agreement. While tariffs were phased out for almost all agricultural products, NAFTA (in accordance with the original CUSTA provisions) exempted certain products from market liberalization. These exemptions included U.S. imports from Canada of dairy products, peanuts, peanut butter, cotton, sugar, and sugar-containing products and Canadian imports from the United States of dairy products, poultry, eggs, and margarine. Canada liberalized its agricultural sector under NAFTA, but liberalization did not include its dairy, poultry, and egg product sectors, which continued to be governed by domestic supply management policies and are protected from imports by high over-quota tariffs. Quotas that once governed bilateral agricultural trade in these commodities were redefined, under NAFTA, as tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) to comply with the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), which took effect on January 1, 1995. A TRQ is a quota for a volume of imports at a favorable tariff rate, which was set at zero under NAFTA. Imports beyond the quota volume face higher over-quota tariff rates. The United States, in turn, agreed to improve access to Canadian dairy products, sugar, peanuts, and cotton. The United States would increase TRQs for Canadian dairy, sugar, and sweetened products. Tariffs on cotton and peanut imports into the United States from Canada would be phased out and eliminated five years after the agreement would take effect. As for U.S.-Mexico trade in agricultural products, under NAFTA, Mexico eliminated all the tariffs and quotas that formerly governed agricultural imports from the United States, and the proposed USMCA provides for no further market access changes for imports by Mexico of U.S. agricultural products. The proposed USMCA would have to be approved by Congress and ratified by Canada and Mexico before entering into force. On August 31, 2018, pursuant to TPA, President Trump provided Congress a 90-day notification of his intent to sign a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. On January 29, 2019\u201460 days after an agreement was signed, and as required by TPA\u2014U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer submitted to Congress changes to existing U.S. laws that would be needed to bring the United States into compliance with the proposed USMCA. A report by the USITC on the possible economic impact of TPA is not expected to be completed until April 20, 2019, due to the 35-day government shutdown. The report has been cited by some Members of Congress as key to their decisions on whether to support the agreement. Some policymakers have stated that the path to ratifying USMCA by Congress is uncertain partially because the three countries have yet to resolve disputes over tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, as well as retaliatory tariffs that Canada and Mexico have imposed on U.S. agricultural products.

    "crs_R45101": "Since the late 1700s, Congress has expressed public gratitude to individuals and groups by awarding medals and other similar decorations. The first Congressional Gold Medals were issued by the Continental Congress. Since that time, Congress has awarded gold medals to express public gratitude for distinguished contributions, dramatize the virtues of patriotism, and perpetuate the remembrance of great events. This tradition of authorizing individually struck gold medals bearing the portraits or actions of honorees is rich with history. Although Congress has approved legislation stipulating specific requirements for numerous other awards and decorations, there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals. When such an award has been deemed appropriate, Congress has, by special action, provided for the creation of a personalized medal to be given in its name. Congressional Gold Medals have long been an important way for Congress to express public gratitude for important historical events and achievements. Congressional Gold Medals, which have been issued since the American Revolution, are \"the highest civilian honor award program... [to] honor national achievement in patriotic, humanitarian, and artistic endeavors.\" In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has \"soared from four or five per decade for most of its history to an average of almost twenty in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.\" Each Congress, legislation to award Congressional Gold Medals is introduced. In the 113th Congress (2013-2014), 52 bills were introduced, 34 in the House and 18 in the Senate, to award a gold medal. In the 114th Congress (2015-2016), 52 bills were introduced, 38 in the House and 14 in the Senate. In the 115th Congress (2017-2018), 55 bills were introduced, 33 in the House and 22 in the Senate. Based on the number of measures offered in both chambers, some Members of Congress clearly feel it is important to recognize individuals and groups for their patriotic, humanitarian, and artistic achievements. Several considerations appear important when Members decide to introduce gold medal legislation. These include who should be honored, how many medals should be awarded in a given Congress, and whether specific design elements should be prescribed for the medal design. As Congress continues to consider legislation to award future gold medals, these considerations and others will likely be important factors for issuing the award.",

    "crs_R42699": "Under the Constitution, the war powers are divided between Congress and the President. Among other relevant grants, Congress has the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces (Article I, Section 8), while the President is Commander in Chief (Article II, Section 2). It is generally agreed that the Commander-in-Chief role gives the President power to utilize the armed forces to repel attacks against the United States, but there has long been controversy over whether he is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. Congressional concern about presidential use of armed forces without congressional authorization intensified after the Korean conflict. During the Vietnam War, Congress searched for a way to assert authority to decide when the United States should become involved in a war or the armed forces be utilized in circumstances that might lead to hostilities. On November 7, 1973, it passed the War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) over the veto of President Nixon. The main purpose of the Resolution was to establish procedures for both branches to share in decisions that might get the United States involved in war. The drafters sought to circumscribe the President's authority to use armed forces abroad in hostilities or potential hostilities without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization, yet provide enough flexibility to permit him to respond to attack or other emergencies. The record of the War Powers Resolution since its enactment has been mixed, and after 40 years it remains controversial. Some Members of Congress believe the Resolution has on some occasions served as a restraint on the use of armed forces by Presidents, provided a mode of communication, and given Congress a vehicle for asserting its war powers. Others have sought to amend the Resolution because they believe it has failed to assure a congressional voice in committing U.S. troops to potential conflicts abroad. Others in Congress, along with executive branch officials, contend that the President needs more flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy and that the time limitation in the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional and impractical. Some have argued for its repeal. This report examines the provisions of the War Powers Resolution, actual experience in its use from its enactment in 1973 through March 2015, and proposed amendments to it. Appendix A lists instances which Presidents have reported to Congress under the War Powers Resolution, and Appendix B lists certain instances of the use of U.S. Armed Forces that were not reported.",

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will implement the provisions, most of which take effect in calendar year 2019. The 2018 farm bill includes 12 titles covering different program areas. The first title, Title I\u2014Commodities, authorizes several major revenue support and disaster assistance programs. The first tier of support is provided by the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program, which offers a minimum price guarantee for production of \"loan\" commodities in the form of a short-term loan at statutorily set prices. The MAL program may be supplemented by a higher, second tier of revenue support comprised of two other programs: (1) the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, which provides price protection via statutory fixed \"reference\" prices for eligible crops, or (2) the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program, which provides revenue protection via historical moving average revenue guarantees based on the five most recent years of crop prices and yields. PLC and ARC are available for producers that own or rent historical \"base\" acres of \"covered\" commodities. The sugar and dairy sectors are supported by separate federal farm programs that are tailored more specifically to the physical differences associated with each of their products\u2014refined sugar and liquid fresh milk\u2014and their respective markets. Disaster assistance is available for producers of most tree crops and livestock. The Noninsured Crop Assistance Program is available for all agricultural commodities that are not covered by a federal crop insurance policy. All of these Title I programs existed under the previous 2014 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill extends their authority through crop year 2023 but with some modifications to most of them. Occasionally, agricultural producers may receive federal support under programs authorized outside of the farm bill. The Secretary of Agriculture has broad latitude under the authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act to make direct payments in support of U.S. agriculture. Two such programs implemented in recent years under CCC authority are the Cotton Ginning Cost Share program and the Market Facilitation Program. Separately, under the federal crop insurance program, Title I program commodities\u2014along with more than 100 other crops including fruits and vegetables\u2014are also eligible for subsidized crop insurance, which provides within-year yield (or revenue) protection. The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized outside of the omnibus farm bill by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).

    "crs_RS22954": "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program financed by federal payroll taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These revenues are deposited into the appropriate account within the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Originally, the intent of the UC program, among other goals, was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions. This intent is reflected in the current UC program's funding and benefit structure. When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax revenues. At the same time, UC program spending falls because fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy. It also creates a surplus of funds, or a reserve fund, for the UC program to draw upon during a recession. These reserve balances are credited in the state's account within the UTF. During an economic slowdown or recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy. The federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) imposes a 6.0% gross federal unemployment tax rate on the first $7,000 paid annually by employers to each employee. Employers in states with programs approved by the U.S. Labor Secretary and with no outstanding federal loans may credit up to 5.4 percentage points of state unemployment taxes paid against the 6.0% tax rate, making the minimum net federal unemployment tax rate 0.6%. Federal law, which requires states to pay these benefits, provides a loan mechanism within the UTF framework that an insolvent state may opt to use to meet its UC benefit payment obligations. States must repay these loans. If the loans are not paid back quickly (depending on the timing of the beginning of the loan period), states may face interest charges and the states' employers may face increased net FUTA rates until the loans are repaid. In the years immediately following the most recent recession, many states had insufficient SUTA revenue and UTF account balances to pay UC benefits. The federal Unemployment Account (FUA) is the federal loan account within the UTF. The FUA is primarily funded from the statutory transfer of excess revenue from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) being deposited into the FUA. If needed, the FUA may borrow funds from other federal accounts within the UTF or from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. From FY2009 to FY2015, the FUA had to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance loans to the state accounts.

At the start of the Saudi-led intervention on March 25, 2015, the Administration announced that the United States would provide \"logistical and intelligence support\" to the coalition's operations without taking \"direct military action in Yemen in support of this effort.\" Soon thereafter, a joint U.S.-Saudi planning cell was established to coordinate military and intelligence support for the campaign. At the United Nations Security Council, the United States supported the passage of Resolution 2216 (April 2015), which, among other things, required member states to impose an arms embargo against the Houthi-Saleh forces and demanded that the Houthis withdraw from all areas seized during the current conflict. Since the March 2015 Saudi-led coalition intervention in Yemen, Congress has taken an active role in debating and overseeing U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Members have considered legislative proposals seeking to reduce Yemeni civilian casualties resulting from the coalition's operations; improve deteriorating humanitarian conditions; end restrictions on the flow of goods and humanitarian aid; combat Iranian support for the Houthis; preserve maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait; and/or support continued Saudi-led coalition and U.S. efforts to counter Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen. Beyond Yemen, many Members have appeared to view the conflict through the prism of a broader regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the U.S. effort to limit Iran's malign regional influence. Others lawmakers have viewed the Yemen conflict as indicative of what they perceive as problems in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, a concern that deepened after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel in October 2018. Congress has considered but has not enacted proposals to curtail or condition U.S. defense sales to Saudi Arabia. Responding to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen also appears to be reinvigorating some Members' interest in strengthening the role of Congress in foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the executive branch. Debate in Congress over Yemen has featured bipartisan statements of interest in asserting the prerogatives of the legislative branch to limit executive branch power, specifically using war powers legislation and the appropriations and authorization processes to curb U.S. military involvement in support of coalition operations. Congressional scrutiny of U.S. policy in Yemen also has led to legislative changes to global authorities, such as the Department of Defense's authority to enter into and use acquisition and cross servicing agreements with partner militaries.",

It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs. The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children\u2014specifically, those headed by single mothers\u2014that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s. The 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding (appropriations) for TANF through the end of FY2002. Most of the legislative activity on TANF since 2002 has been to extend the program funding and financing authority for TANF. Most of these extensions did not change TANF policy, though policy changes were included in extensions enacted in 2006, 2010, and 2012. The TANF Extension Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-4) extended TANF funding through June 30, 2019. This report will begin with a brief overview of the history of the AFDC program and the welfare reform debates of the 1960s to the 1990s. That overview will be followed by a summary of the 1996 welfare reform law and the changes made since 1996. The report concludes with a detailed chronology of TANF legislation.",
    "crs_RS20530": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans. If a mortgage borrower defaults on a mortgage\u2014that is, does not repay the mortgage as promised\u2014and the home goes to foreclosure, FHA is to pay the lender the remaining amount that the borrower owes. FHA insurance protects the lender, rather than the borrower, in the event of borrower default; a borrower who defaults on an FHA-insured mortgage will still experience the consequences of foreclosure. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by a lender that has been approved by FHA, and the mortgage and the borrower must meet certain criteria. FHA is one of three government agencies that provide insurance or guarantees on certain home mortgages made by private lenders, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Of these federal mortgage insurance programs, FHA is the most broadly targeted. Unlike VA- and USDA-insured mortgages, the availability of FHA-insured mortgages is not limited by factors such as veteran status, income, or whether the property is located in a rural area. However, the availability or attractiveness of FHA-insured mortgages may be limited by other factors, such as the maximum mortgage amount that FHA will insure, the fees that it charges for insurance, and its eligibility standards. This report provides background on FHA's history and market role and an overview of the basic eligibility and underwriting criteria for FHA-insured home loans. It also provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insures, along with data on FHA's market share in recent years. It does not go into detail on the financial status of the FHA mortgage insurance fund.

    "crs_R40864": "The issue of the President and Vice President's term of office is generally regarded as an accepted constitutional norm that arouses little controversy in the 21st century. Both the four-year term and the venerable two-term tradition, initiated by George Washington and ultimately incorporated in the Constitution in 1951 by the Twenty-Second Amendment, appear to be fixed elements in the nation's political landscape. In marked comparison, the issues of tenure and reelection of the President, and of the Vice President (an office added almost as an afterthought during the Constitutional Convention of 1787), were the subject of intense and prolonged debate during the Philadelphia gathering. Delegates argued for three months over the length of the presidential term and whether the chief executive should be eligible for reelection before reaching a compromise package of provisions\u2014a four-year term, and eligibility for reelection\u2014several days before the convention adjourned. Since that time, a wide range of changes to these conditions has been proposed as constitutional amendments, but relatively few conditions have been added to the original provisions governing the President's term of office. In addition to the Twenty-Second Amendment cited above, the Twelfth, ratified in 1804, set the same qualifications for the Vice President; the Twentieth, ratified in 1933, set January 20 of every year following a presidential election as the date on which the chief executive's term begins; and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment clarified the question of vice-presidential succession to the presidency and authorized the President to nominate persons to fill vacancies in the vice presidency, subject to approval by vote of both houses of Congress. Proposals for a single term were popular in the 19th century, and for several decades before the Civil War, the concept of a voluntary limit of one presidential term in office drew wide support. Beginning in 1808, constitutional amendments were introduced that would have changed the presidential term to five, six, seven, or eight years. By the 20th century, the single six-year term for Presidents had become a preferred option for such amendments, with multiple amendment proposals introduced in successive Congresses as late as the 1990s, while amendments to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment to allow unlimited reelection were regularly introduced as recently as the 113th Congress. In the past two decades, however, public and congressional interest in these issues has arguably declined. In contrast to proceedings at the Constitutional Convention and widespread congressional interest in the past, the questions of presidential term and tenure appear to be relatively settled issues in the contemporary context. Nevertheless, the potential for renewed interest in change, which has emerged as a force to be contended with in the past, remains a possibility in both the present and future.",

The United States has not used conscription to fill manpower requirements for over four decades; however, the Selective Service System and the requirement for young men to register for the draft remain today. Men who fail to register are subject to penalties in the form of lost benefits and criminal action. Some have questioned the need to maintain this agency and the registration requirements. Others have questioned whether the current requirements for registration are fair and equitable. This report is intended to provide Congress with information about how the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA), the Selective Service System (SSS), and associated requirements for registration have evolved over time. It explains why the United States developed the SSS, what the system looks like today, how constituents are affected by the MSSA requirements, and what the options and considerations may be for the future of the Selective Service. The first section of the report provides background and history on the Military Selective Service Act, the Selective Service System, and the implementation of the draft in the United States. The second section discusses statutory registration requirements, processes for registering, and penalties for failing to register. The third section discusses the current organization, roles, and resourcing of the Selective Service System. The final section discusses policy options and consideration for Congress for the future of the MSSA and the Selective Service System. This report does not discuss the state of the all-volunteer force or whether it is adequate to meet our nation's current or future manpower needs. In addition, it will not provide an analysis of other options for military manpower resourcing such as universal military service or universal military training. It also does not discuss the history of the draft and draft planning for health service workers. Finally, this report does not evaluate whether the SSS, as currently structured, is adequately resourced and organized to perform its statutory mission.

    "crs_R45294": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the federal government's largest agency. The majority of the funding for the activities of HUD comes from discretionary appropriations provided each year in annual appropriations acts, typically as a part of the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (THUD). HUD's programs are designed primarily to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs and to expand access to homeownership. Three main rental assistance programs\u2014Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance (which funds Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers), Section 8 project-based rental assistance, and public housing\u2014account for the majority of the department's funding (about 78% of total HUD appropriations in FY2018). All three programs provide deep subsidies allowing low-income recipients to pay below-market, income-based rents. Additional, smaller programs are targeted specifically to persons who are elderly and persons with disabilities. Two flexible block grant programs\u2014the HOME Investment Partnerships grant program and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program\u2014help states and local governments finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Following disasters, special supplemental CDBG disaster recovery (CDBG-DR) grants are funded by Congress to help communities rebuild damaged housing and community infrastructure. Native American tribes receive their own direct housing grants through the Native American Housing Block Grant. Other, more-specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, through the Homeless Assistance Grants and the Continuum of Care and Emergency Solutions Grants programs, as well as those living with HIV/AIDS. Additional programs fund fair housing enforcement activities and healthy homes activities, including lead-based paint hazard identification and remediation. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to homebuyers with low down payments and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers, which are used to sustain its insurance funds. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset the cost of the HUD budget.

    "crs_R43568": "Corporate inversions are a process by which an existing U.S. corporation changes its country of residence. After the inversion, the original U.S. corporation becomes a subsidiary of a foreign parent corporation. Corporate inversions occur through three different paths: the substantial activity test, merger with a larger foreign firm, and merger with a smaller foreign firm. Regardless of the form of the inversion, the typical result is that the new foreign parent company faces a lower home country tax rate and no tax on the company's foreign-source income. The U.S. firm can use inversions to reduce taxes using various techniques. Foreign operations in the future can be formed as subsidiaries of the new foreign parent in a country with a territorial tax, so that future foreign income can be exempt from tax. Accumulated and future foreign income from the U.S. company's foreign subsidiaries (which would be taxed by the United States if paid to the parent as a dividend) may be effectively repatriated tax free by lending or otherwise investing in the related foreign firm, such as a low-interest loan to the foreign parent holding company. These borrowed funds could then be used, for example, to pay dividends to shareholders or make loans to the U.S. firm. In addition, the combined firm can engage in \"earnings stripping\": reducing income in the U.S. firm by borrowing from the U.S. company and increasing interest deductions. For example, a foreign parent may lend to its U.S. subsidiary. This intercompany debt does not alter the overall company's debt, but does result in an interest expense in the United States (which reduces U.S. taxes paid) and an increased portion of company income being \"booked\" outside the United States. Royalty payments, management fees, and transfer pricing arrangements are other avenues for earnings stripping, but are thought to be of lesser importance than intercompany debt.

    "crs_R41146": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses \"that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions.\" The SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program is considered the agency's flagship loan program. Its name is derived from Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended), which authorizes the SBA to provide and guarantee business loans to American small businesses. The SBA also administers several 7(a) subprograms that offer streamlined and expedited loan procedures for particular groups of borrowers, including the SBAExpress, Export Express, and Community Advantage Pilot programs. Although these subprograms have their own distinguishing eligibility requirements, terms, and benefits, they operate under the 7(a) program's authorization. Proceeds from 7(a) loans may be used to establish a new business or to assist in the operation, acquisition, or expansion of an existing business. Specific uses include to acquire land (by purchase or lease); improve a site (e.g., grading, streets, parking lots, landscaping); purchase, convert, expand, or renovate one or more existing buildings; construct one or more new buildings; acquire (by purchase or lease) and install fixed assets; purchase inventory, supplies, and raw materials; finance working capital; and refinance certain outstanding debts. In FY2018, the SBA approved 60,353 7(a) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion. The average approved 7(a) loan amount was $420,401. The total number and amount of SBA 7(a) loans approved (and actually disbursed) declined in FY2008 and FY2009, increased during FY2010 and FY2011, declined somewhat in FY2012, and have increased since then. Historically, one of the justifications presented for funding the SBA's loan guaranty programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage, compared with other businesses, when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit. Congressional interest in the 7(a) loan program has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to grow and create jobs. Some Members of Congress have argued that the SBA should be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations with the expectation that in so doing small businesses will create jobs. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to help small businesses further economic growth and job creation. This report discusses the rationale provided for the 7(a) program; the program's borrower and lender eligibility standards and program requirements; and program statistics, including loan volume, loss rates, use of the proceeds, borrower satisfaction, and borrower demographics. It also examines issues raised concerning the SBA's administration of the 7(a) program, including the oversight of 7(a) lenders and the program's lack of outcome-based performance measures. This report also surveys congressional and presidential actions taken in recent years to help small businesses gain greater access to capital. For example, during the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the SBA an additional $730 million, including $375 million to temporarily subsidize the 7(a) and 504/Certified Development Companies (504/CDC) loan guaranty programs' fees ($299 million) and to temporarily increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% ($76 million). P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, provided $505 million (plus $5 million for administrative expenses) to extend the fee subsidies and 90% loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010; increased the 7(a) program's gross loan limit from $2 million to $5 million; and established an alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/CDC loan programs to enable more small businesses to qualify for assistance. P.L. 111-322, the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue the fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011). During the 112th Congress, several bills were introduced to expand the 7(a) program: S. 1828, a bill",

The federal government is involved in these settlements pursuant to its tribal trust responsibilities. Many of these settlements have been authorized by Congress to provide funding for projects that allow tribes to access and develop their water resources. At issue for Congress is not only the new settlements completing negotiations but also how well the current process for negotiating and recommending settlements for authorization is working.

    "crs_R42035": "Social Security is a self-financing program that provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. As of March 2019, there were approximately 63.3 million Social Security beneficiaries. Of those, 47.2 million (74.6%) were retired workers and family members, 10.1 million (16.0%) were disabled workers and family members, and 6.0 million (9.4%) were survivors of deceased workers. Social Security is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and their employers. An estimated 176 million workers are covered by Social Security. Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of covered earnings, up to an annual limit; self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income, up to an annual limit. The annual limit on taxable earnings is $132,900 in 2019. Social Security is also credited with tax revenues from the federal income taxes paid by some beneficiaries on a portion of their benefits. In addition, Social Security receives interest income from Social Security trust fund investments. Social Security income and outgo are accounted for in two separate trust funds authorized under Title II of the Social Security Act: the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund. This report refers to the separate OASI and DI trust funds on a combined basis as the Social Security trust funds. In 2018, the combined Social Security trust funds (OASDI) had total receipts of $1,003 billion, total expenditures of $1,000 billion, and accumulated holdings (assets) of more than $2.9 trillion. The Social Security reform debate is an ongoing interest to lawmakers. For some advocates of reform, the focus is on restoring long-range solvency to the trust funds. For others, the focus is on constraining the projected growth in spending for entitlement programs\u2014including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid\u2014in the context of broader efforts to reduce growing federal budget deficits. The Social Security reform debate reflects other policy objectives as well, such as improving the adequacy and equity of benefits, and different philosophical views about the role of the Social Security program and the federal government in providing retirement income. Over the years, the debate has reflected two fundamentally different approaches to reform. The traditional approach would maintain the current structure of the program (i.e., a defined benefit system funded on a pay-as-you-go basis) by making relatively modest changes, such as an increase in the retirement age or an increase in the taxable wage base. In general, the goal of this approach is to preserve the social insurance nature of the program. In contrast, the personal savings and investment approach would redesign the 1930s-era program to create a prefunded system in which benefits would be based partially or entirely on personal savings and investments. More recently, the Social Security debate has reflected a shift in focus among some lawmakers away from efforts to scale back the program toward proposals that would expand Social Security benefits to address concerns about the adequacy of benefits and, more broadly, retirement income security.",
    "crs_R45718": "The Antiquities Act was enacted in 1906 in response to the destruction of prehistoric ruins and other archaeological sites in the western United States, often by amateur archaeologists and treasure hunters. The act authorizes the President to declare, by public proclamation, historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest located on federal land as national monuments. It also authorizes the President to reserve parcels of land surrounding these objects, but limits the size of such reservations to \"the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\" Though the Antiquities Act was enacted with the primary goal of preserving archaeological sites, it has also been frequently used to protect naturally occurring objects, such as the geological features within the Grand Canyon National Monument. Once a national monument is established, use of the lands and resources within the monument's boundaries are subject to the limitations specified in the proclamation itself and other sources of law, without need of congressional authorization. Since its enactment, Presidents have used the Antiquities Act to establish 158 national monuments, reserving millions of acres of land in the process, and to modify existing monuments more than 90 times. Like many laws concerning federal lands, the Antiquities Act operates in the midst of an ongoing, and sometimes contentious, public policy debate regarding how to best reconcile the need to preserve natural resources and other objects located on public lands with the needs of the local communities affected by the limitations on land use that follow from the creation of a national monument. Though most monument proclamations have been uncontroversial, some have precipitated corrective legislation and litigation. In two instances, Congress passed legislation placing geographic limits on the President's authority to establish national monuments. Attempts to undo proclamations through litigation have been less successful, as courts have uniformly upheld challenged proclamations through a broad interpretation of the Antiquities Act. The Antiquities Act has received renewed attention in recent years as a result of President Trump's December 2017 proclamations reducing the size of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and the Bears Ears National Monument. Various groups have challenged those proclamations in federal district court, arguing (among other things) that the Antiquities Act does not empower the President to diminish the size of national monuments. These cases will be the first time a court has had an opportunity to address whether the President has such authority. This report begins by discussing the Antiquities Act's legislative history. It then provides an overview of the act's provisions before reviewing past presidential proclamations as well as judicial decisions and legislation related to certain monument proclamations. Finally, the report discusses the current litigation involving President Trump's proclamations diminishing the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears monuments, with a focus on the parties' arguments addressing whether the Antiquities Act authorizes the President to diminish a national monument.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin also announced, on February 2, 2019, that Russia would suspend its participation in the treaty. U.S. and Russian officials had met in Geneva on January 15, 2019, in one last attempt to reach an agreement. According to press reports, Russian diplomats proposed that Russia display the 9M729 missile and demonstrate that it could not fly to INF range, while the United States, in exchange, could demonstrate that the MK-41 launchers in Romania could not be converted to launch INF-range cruise missiles. The United States rejected this proposal and indicated that the only acceptable solution would be for Russia to destroy the missile, its launchers, and its supporting infrastructure. Nevertheless, on January 23, 2019, Russia displayed the canister for the 9M729 cruise missile for an audience of foreign military attach\u00e9s and the press. Russia noted that, although the missile was a little longer than the similar 9M728 cruise missile, the added length did not increase the range of the missile. It was needed to house a larger warhead and guidance system. No officials from the United States or NATO nations attended the display, arguing that it was a public relations event. U.S. officials also argued that a static display of the missile's canister would not address questions about the missile's range in flight. Over the past few years, NATO, as a whole, has echoed U.S. concerns about Russia's new missile, but some Members have expressed doubt about whether the United States had enough evidence to conclude that the missile violated the INF Treaty. This doubt has ebbed recently, as the allies have offered strong support for the U.S. decision to withdraw from the treaty. In the joint statement released after their December 4 meeting, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that they \"strongly support the finding... that Russia is in material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty.\" In a statement released on February 1, 2019, the North Atlantic Council noted that Russia had \"taken no demonstrable steps toward returning to full and verifiable compliance\" and that \"Russia will bear sole responsibility for the end of the Treaty.\" At the same time, the statement noted that the \"allies are firmly committed to the preservation of effective international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation\" and \"will continue to uphold, support, and further strengthen arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in the State Department's Annual Report, that Russia has attempted to \"obfuscate the nature of the program.\" The United States has not disputed, publicly, Russia's assertion that it did not test the missile to INF range, but it did note, in",
    "crs_R45546": "The Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles. The river runs through seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior [DOI]) plays a prominent role in the management of the basin's waters. In the Lower Basin (i.e., Arizona, Nevada, and California), Reclamation also serves as water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, a role that elevates the status of the federal government in basin water management. The federal role in the management of Colorado River water is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin, which provide low-cost water and hydropower supplies to water users. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) purposes. The river's flow and stored water also are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation, among other uses. A majority (70%) of basin water supplies are used to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land; basin waters also provide M&I water supplies to nearly 40 million people. The river also provides habitat for a wide range of species, including several federally endangered species. It flows through 7 national wildlife refuges and 11 National Park Service (NPS) units; these and other areas of the river support important recreational opportunities. Precipitation and runoff in the basin are highly variable. Water conditions on the river depend largely on snowmelt in the basin's northern areas. Observed data (1906-2018) show that natural flows in the Colorado River Basin averaged about 14.8 million acre-feet (MAF) annually. Flows have dipped significantly during the current drought, which dates to 2000; natural flows from 2000 to 2018 averaged approximately 12.4 MAF per year. In 2018, Reclamation estimated that the 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest period in more than 100 years of record keeping. The dry conditions are consistent with prior droughts in the basin that were identified through tree ring studies; some of these droughts lasted for decades. Climate change impacts, including warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, may further increase the likelihood of prolonged drought in the basin. Pursuant to the multiple compacts, federal laws, court decisions and decrees, contracts, and regulatory guidelines governing Colorado River operations (collectively known as the Law of the River), Congress and the federal government play a prominent role in the management of the Colorado River. Specifically, Congress funds and oversees Reclamation's management of Colorado River Basin facilities, including facility operations and programs to protect and restore endangered species. Congress has also approved and continues to actively consider Indian water rights settlements involving Colorado River waters, and development of new and expanded water storage in the basin. In addition, Congress has approved funding to mitigate drought and stretch basin water supplies and has considered new authorities for Reclamation to combat drought and enter into agreements with states and Colorado River contractors. This report provides background on management of the Colorado River, including a discussion of trends and agreements since 2000. It also discusses the congressional role in the management of basin waters.",
    "crs_R43997": "The four major federal land management agencies maintain tens of thousands of diverse assets in dispersed locations. These agencies are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all within the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Forest Service (FS) within the Department of Agriculture. These agencies maintain assets to preserve their functioning and to repair and replace components as needed. The infrastructure needs of the federal land management agencies have been a subject of significant federal and public attention for many years. Congressional and administrative attention has focused on deferred maintenance and repairs, defined as \"maintenance and repairs that were not performed when they should have been or were scheduled to be and which are put off or delayed for a future period.\" \"Maintenance and repair\" include a variety of activities intended to preserve assets in an acceptable condition, including activities such as preventive maintenance and replacement of parts, systems, and components. These terms do not include activities intended to expand the capacity of assets to allow them to serve different purposes or significantly increased needs. Deferred maintenance and repairs often are called the maintenance backlog. The agencies assert that continuing to defer the maintenance and repair of facilities accelerates the rate of these facilities' deterioration, increases their repair costs, and decreases their value. Debate has focused on varied issues, including the level of funds needed to reduce deferred maintenance, whether agencies are using existing funding efficiently, the priority of deferred maintenance relative to regular maintenance, and whether additional sources of funds should be directed to maintenance. Other issues include how to balance the maintenance of existing infrastructure with the acquisition of new assets, whether disposal of assets is desirable given limited funding, and how much to prioritize maintaining infrastructure relative to other government functions. Another issue relates to the dollar amount of deferred maintenance and the reasons for fluctuations over time. This report focuses on these issues. It first provides agency deferred maintenance estimates for FY2018, the most recent fiscal year for which this information is available. It also discusses changes in deferred maintenance over the past decade (FY2009-FY2018) and then identifies some of the factors that likely contributed to these changes. The four agencies had combined FY2018 deferred maintenance estimated at $19.38 billion. The agencies had widely varying shares of the total. NPS had the largest portion, 62%, based on an estimate of $11.92 billion. The FS share was 27% of the total, with an estimated deferred maintenance of $5.20 billion. The FWS portion was 7%, reflecting the agency's deferred maintenance of $1.30 billion. BLM had the smallest share, 5%, based on a backlog estimate of $0.96 billion. Each agency's deferred maintenance estimate for FY2018 consisted of various components. For FS, the single largest asset class was roads, which comprised 61% of the FY2018 total of $5.20 billion. The next largest asset class was buildings, which represented 24% of the FS FY2018 total. The next two largest asset classes were trails and bridges, each with 5%. Six other asset classes made up the remaining 6%. For NPS, the largest asset category was roads, bridges, and trails, which comprised 57% of the FY2018 deferred maintenance total of $11.92 billion. The buildings category comprised 19% of the total, followed by 18% for other structures and 6% for irrigation, dams, and other water structures. Roads, bridges, and trails also reflected the largest share of BLM's deferred maintenance, with 69% of the $0.96 billion total. Two other categories of assets had relatively comparable portions, specifically 14% for buildings and 12% for other structures. The remaining 6% was for irrigation, dams, and other water structures. Roads, bridges, and trails also reflected the largest share of BLM's deferred maintenance, with 69% of the $0.96 billion total.

    "crs_R45148": "Trade is a mutually enriching and can leave both trade partners better off. Through trade, a country can enjoy a higher standard of living by producing those things it does efficiently and trading for things that it produces less efficiently, driven by comparative advantage. This enables a country to produce more from its resources and enjoy a higher level of consumption than would be possible without trade. A major benefit of trade is the ability to import goods and services and boost consumer welfare. The United States imports for several reasons: some goods cannot be produced domestically in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand or would be costly to produce relative to other economic activities; other products and services are imported because they can be produced less expensively or more efficiently by foreign firms. Because of global value chains, many U.S. imports contain U.S.-made components (e.g., semiconductors in a computer) or U.S.-grown raw materials (e.g., cotton used to make t-shirts). Through trade, consumers can access a greater variety of goods at lower cost. Trade improves consumer purchasing power, particularly for lower-income households that spend a greater share of income on imported goods like clothing. These factors also help control the rate of inflation. Through trade, producers can access lower-cost inputs used in production and exports, which can improve global competitiveness. In the long term, trade leads to greater competition and can pressure firms to innovate and invest in research and development (R&D), supporting increased productivity and economic growth. The United States is a major global trader. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies (in terms of the value of goods and services trade) were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. However, if the 28 EU members are treated as a single trading bloc, the EU would be the largest trading economy, with extra-EU trade of $6.0 trillion.

    "crs_R45706": "The nuclear power industry is facing severe economic challenges in the United States. High capital costs, low electricity demand growth, and competition from cheaper sources of electricity such as natural gas and renewables have dampened the demand for new nuclear power plants and accelerated the retirement of existing reactors. The only power reactors currently under construction in the United States\u2014two new units at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia\u2014are five years behind schedule and nearly double their original estimated cost. All nuclear power in the United States is generated by light water reactors (LWRs), which were commercialized in the 1950s and early 1960s and are now used throughout most of the world. LWRs are cooled by ordinary (\"light\") water, which also slows (\"moderates\") the neutrons that maintain the nuclear fission chain reaction. Conventional LWRs are large\u2014with 1,000 megawatts electric generating capacity (MWe) or more\u2014in order to spread their high construction costs among the maximum possible number of kilowatt-hours of electricity over their operating lifetime. At the same time conventional reactors are facing an uncertain future, some in Congress contend that more nuclear power plants, not fewer, are needed to help reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and bring low-carbon power to the majority of the world that currently has little access to electricity. Proponents of this view argue that the key to increasing the number of nuclear power plants is investment in \"advanced\" nuclear technologies, which they say could overcome the economic problems, safety concerns, and other issues that have stalled the growth of conventional LWRs. Advanced reactors encompass a wide range of technologies, including next-generation water-cooled reactors (e.g., small modular light water reactors, supercritical water-cooled reactors), non-water-cooled reactors (e.g., lead or sodium fast reactors, molten salt reactors, and high temperature gas reactors), and fusion reactors. Some advanced reactor concepts are relatively new, while others have been under consideration for decades. Not all observers are optimistic about the potential safety, affordability, proliferation resistance and sustainability of advanced reactors. Because many of these technologies are in the conceptual or design phases, the potential advantages of these systems have not yet been established on a commercial scale. Testing and demonstration would be required to determine the validity of advocates' claims. Many environmental advocates contend that nuclear power would not be necessary to decarbonize world energy supplies, and that public policy should instead focus on renewable energy and efficiency. The U.S. advanced nuclear industry has expanded in recent years to encompass an array of developers, suppliers, and supporting institutions. By one count, there were 35 U.S. companies developing advanced nuclear reactor technologies as of November 2018. Some have projected that the first U.S. advanced reactor could be providing electricity to the grid by the mid-2020s. For example, the advanced reactor company NuScale predicts that its first nuclear plant will \"achieve commercial operation in 2026.\" This report discusses the history of advanced reactor technologies, briefly describes major categories of advanced reactors, provides an overview of federal programs on advanced nuclear technology, and discusses current issues and legislation.",

    "crs_R42045": "The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) was enacted as part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of capital to small businesses. Advocates argued that the fund would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The SBLF was enacted as part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of capital to small businesses. Advocates argued that the fund would help to address the decline in small business lending and create jobs. Opponents were not convinced that it would enhance small business lending and worried about the program's potential cost to the federal treasury and its similarities to TARP. Participating institutions are reporting they have increased their small business lending. However, questions have been raised concerning the validity of these reported amounts. Specifically, as Treasury's Office of Inspector General argued in its August 2013 audit, more than one-third of the reported lending gains at that time occurred prior to September 30, 2011, the quarter in which most SBLF participants received their SBLF funds; the reported small business lending gains reflect all of the small business lending gains that the participants achieved, regardless of how the loans were funded; and previous OIG audits \"have shown that a large number of participants misreport their small business lending activity.\" In addition, any analysis of the program's influence on small business lending is likely to be more suggestive than definitive because differentiating the SBLF's effect on small business lending from other factors, such as changes in the lender's local economy, is methodologically challenging, especially given the relatively small amount of financing involved relative to the national market for small business loans. The SBLF's $4.0 billion in financing represents less than 0.7% of outstanding small business loans (as defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In terms of the concerns expressed about the program's potential cost, Treasury initially estimated in December 2010 that the SBLF could cost taxpayers up to $1.26 billion (excluding administrative costs that were initially estimated at about $26 million annually but actual outlays were $4.54 million in FY2014, $9.05 million in FY2015, $5.01 million in FY2016, and $3.4 million in FY2017). Treasury based that estimate on an expectation that about $17 billion in SBLF financings would be disbursed. In October 2011, Treasury estimated the program's costs based on actual participant data. It estimated that the SBLF would generate a savings of $80 million (excluding administrative costs), with the savings coming primarily from a lower-than-expected financing level and, to a lesser extent, improvements in projected default rates \"due to higher participant quality than expected\" and lower market interest rates.",
    "crs_R45732": "A plaintiff injured by a defendant's wrongful conduct may file a tort lawsuit to recover money from that defendant. To name an especially familiar example of a tort, \"a person who causes a crash by negligently driving a vehicle is generally liable to the victim of that crash.\" By forcing people who wrongfully injure others to pay money to their victims, the tort system serves at least two functions: (1) \"deter[ring] people from injuring others\" and (2) \"compensat[ing] those who are injured.\" Employees and officers of the federal government occasionally commit torts just like other members of the general public. Until the mid-20th century, however, the principle of \"sovereign immunity\"\u2014a legal doctrine that bars private citizens from suing a sovereign government without its consent\u2014prohibited plaintiffs from suing the United States for the tortious actions of federal officers and employees. Thus, for a substantial portion of this nation's history, persons injured by torts committed by the federal government's agents were generally unable to obtain financial compensation through the judicial system. Congress, deeming this state of affairs unacceptable, ultimately enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in 1946. The FTCA allows plaintiffs to file and prosecute certain types of tort lawsuits against the United States and thereby potentially recover financial compensation from the federal government. Some FTCA lawsuits are relatively mundane; for instance, a civilian may sue the United States to obtain compensation for injuries sustained as a result of minor accidents on federal property. Other FTCA cases, however, involve grave allegations of government misfeasance. For example, after naval officers allegedly sexually assaulted several women at the infamous Tailhook Convention in 1991, those women invoked the FTCA in an attempt to hold the United States liable for those officers' attacks. Family members of persons killed in the 1993 fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco likewise sued the United States under the FTCA, asserting that federal law enforcement agents committed negligent acts that resulted in the deaths of their relatives. Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed an award of over $100 million against the United States in an FTCA case alleging that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) committed \"egregious government misconduct\" resulting in the wrongful incarceration of several men who were falsely accused of participating in a grisly gangland slaying. Empowering plaintiffs to sue the United States can ensure that persons injured by federal employees receive compensation and justice. However, waiving the government's immunity from tort litigation comes at a significant cost: the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Bureau) reports that the United States spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to pay tort claims under the FTCA, and the Department of Justice reports that it handles thousands of tort claims filed against the United States each year. Moreover, exposing the United States to tort liability arguably creates a risk that government officials may inappropriately base their decisions \"not on the relevant and applicable policy objectives that should be governing the execution of their authority,\" but rather on a desire to reduce the government's \"possible exposure to substantial civil liability.\" As a general matter, the damages that a plaintiff may recover in an FTCA suit are typically determined by the law of the state in which the tort occurred. The FTCA imposes several restrictions on the types and amount of monetary damages that a plaintiff may recover against the United States. With few exceptions, plaintiffs may not recover punitive damages or prejudgment interest against the United States. The FTCA likewise bars most awards of attorney's fees against the government. Furthermore, with limited exceptions, an FTCA plaintiff may not recover any damages that exceed the amount he initially requested when he submitted his claim to the applicable agency to satisfy the FTCA's exhaustion requirement, which this report discusses below.

If the borrower does not repay the mortgage and the home goes to foreclosure, FHA pays the lender the remaining amount that the borrower owes (that is, it pays a claim to the lender). FHA charges borrowers fees, called premiums, in exchange for the insurance. FHA insurance is intended to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to some borrowers who otherwise might be unable to access mortgage credit at affordable interest rates or at all. For example, FHA requires a smaller down payment than many other types of mortgages, potentially making it easier for lower-wealth borrowers, first-time homebuyers, or others for whom a large down payment may present a barrier to homeownership to obtain a mortgage. To qualify for FHA insurance, both the borrower and the mortgage must meet certain criteria. For example, the principal balance of the mortgage must be under a certain dollar threshold. Lenders that originate FHA-insured mortgages must be approved by FHA. Most single-family mortgages insured by FHA are financed through an insurance fund called the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). Since FY2009, the MMI Fund has included FHA-insured reverse mortgages as well as traditional \"forward\" home mortgages. Much of the discussion in this report focuses only on traditional forward mortgages, rather than reverse mortgages. However, certain specified sections discuss both forward and reverse mortgages. Money flows into the MMI Fund primarily from the mortgage insurance premiums paid by borrowers and from sales of foreclosed properties, and money flows out of the MMI Fund primarily from claims paid to lenders when FHA-insured mortgages default. The MMI Fund is intended to be self-supporting. It is meant to pay for costs related to insured loans (such as insurance claims paid to lenders) with money it earns on those loans (such as through premiums paid by borrowers), not through appropriations. The MMI Fund is also required to maintain a capital ratio of 2% to help pay for any unexpected increases in losses on its insured mortgages, beyond the losses that it currently anticipates. (Capital in this context is defined as the assets that the MMI Fund currently has on hand, plus the net present value of future cash flows associated with the mortgages that it currently insures.) The capital ratio is the ratio of capital to the total dollar amount of mortgages insured under the MMI Fund. The MMI Fund, like all federal loan and loan guarantee programs subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, has permanent and indefinite budget authority to receive funds from the Department of the Treasury to cover increases in the costs of loan guarantees made in prior years. FHA faces an inherent tension between facilitating the provision of mortgage credit to underserved borrowers and safeguarding the health of the MMI Fund. In the years following the housing and mortgage market turmoil that began around 2007, rising mortgage default rates and falling home prices put pressure on the MMI Fund. This resulted in the capital ratio falling below the required 2% threshold in FY2009 and then turning negative for a period of time. The capital ratio became positive again in FY2014 and regained the 2% threshold in FY2015. The capital ratio falling below 2%, and then turning negative, raised concerns that the MMI Fund would not have enough money to cover all of its expected future losses on the loans that it was currently insuring. At the end of FY2013, the MMI Fund received $1.7 billion from Treasury using its permanent and indefinite budget authority to ensure that it was holding enough funds to cover expected future losses on insured loans. This represented the first time that the MMI Fund ever had to draw on its permanent and indefinite budget authority with Treasury for this purpose. The MMI Fund has not needed to draw such funds from Treasury in subsequent years. Congress has expressed ongoing interest in the MMI Fund's financial status and its prospects for needing additional funds to pay for future losses on its insured loans.",
    "crs_R45727": "In FY2019 and FY2020, more than 90% of federal highway assistance is being distributed to the states by formula. Highway funding formulas have been in use to apportion federal highway authorizations among the states since the passage of the first federal-aid highway act more than a century ago. The resulting apportionments are widely used to evaluate how individual states benefit from federal highway assistance relative to other states. Although the procedure currently used to distribute federal highway funds is written into law and programs receiving funds in this manner are frequently referred to as \"formula programs,\" the statutory language does not describe any formula in a straightforward way. In consequence, it can be difficult to understand how the apportionment of funds is determined, and whether that apportionment adequately reflects considerations that may be of concern to Members of Congress. This report describes the origins and development of highway formula funding, and then discusses how the use of various formula factors gave way to the current apportionment mechanism. A series of tables compares individual states' shares of the FY2018 apportionment with their shares of some factors relevant to highway needs.",
    "crs_R41268": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including the Historically Underutilized Business Zone Empowerment Contracting (HUBZone) program. The HUBZone program is \"a place-based contracting assistance program whose primary objective is job creation and increasing capital investment in distressed communities.\" It was authorized in 1997 (P.L. 105-135, the HUBZone Act of 1997; Title VI of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997), and the SBA began accepting applications from interested small businesses on March 22, 1999. The HUBZone program provides participating small businesses located in areas with low income, high poverty, or high levels of unemployment with contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides, sole-source awards, and price-evaluation preferences. The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 generally requires \"full and open competition\" for government procurement contracts. However, procurement set-asides are permissible competitive procedures. A set-aside restricts competition for a federal contract to specified contractors. In this case, the competition may be restricted to SBA-certified HUBZone businesses if there is a reasonable expectation of at least two SBA-certified HUBZone bidders and a fair market price. A sole-source award is a federal contract awarded, or proposed for award, without competition. In any full and open competition for a federal contract \"the price offered by a qualified HUBZone business shall be deemed as being lower than the price of another offeror if the HUBZone business price offer is not more than 10% higher than the other offer.\" Price-evaluation preferences accounted for about 18.2% of HUBZone program contract dollars ($346.9 million of $1.90 billion) in FY2017. In FY2017, the federal government awarded 81,082 contracts valued at $7.53 billion to HUBZone-certified businesses. About $1.90 billion of that amount was awarded with a HUBZone preference ($1.49 billion through a HUBZone set-aside, $65.3 million through a HUBZone sole-source award, and $346.9 million through a HUBZone price-evaluation preference). About $1.53 billion of that amount was awarded to HUBZone-certified businesses in open competition with other firms. The remaining $4.10 billion was awarded with another small business preference (e.g., set aside and sole source awards for small business generally and for 8(a), women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses). The program's administrative cost is about $9.8 million annually. It received an appropriation of $3 million for FY2019, with the additional cost of administering the program provided by the SBA's appropriation for salaries and general administrative expenses. Congressional interest in the HUBZone program has increased in recent years, primarily due to U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports of fraud in the program and efforts by small businesses to ease HUBZone eligibility requirements. This report examines arguments presented both for and against targeting assistance to geographic areas with specified characteristics as opposed to providing assistance to people or businesses with specified characteristics; assesses arguments presented both for and against the creation and continuation of the HUBZone program, starting with the arguments presented during consideration of P.L. 105-135, which authorized the program; discusses the HUBZone program's structure and operation, focusing on the definitions of HUBZone areas and HUBZone small businesses and the program's performance relative to federal contracting goals; and provides an analysis of the SBA's administration of the HUBZone program and the SBA's performance measures. This report also examines HUBZone-related legislation, including P.L. 114-92, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which expanded the definition of a Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC) military base closure area to make it easier for businesses located in those areas to meet the HUBZone program's requirement that at least 35% of its employees reside in a HUBZone area. It also extended BRAC base closure area HUBZone eligibility from five years to not less than eight years, provided HUBZone eligibility to qualified disaster areas, and added Native Hawaiian Organizations to the list of HUBZone eligible small business concerns. P.L. 115-91, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which included provisions from several bills introduced during the 115th Congress, including S. 929, the Invest in Rural Small Business Act of 2017, and H.R.",

    "crs_R45584": "\"Cross-border data flows\" refer to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Cross-border data flows are part of, and integral to, digital trade and facilitate the movement of goods, services, people, and finance. Effective and sustainable digital trade relies on data flows that permit commerce and communication but that also ensure privacy and security, protect intellectual property, and build trust and confidence. Impeding cross-border data flows, including through some privacy regulations, may decrease efficiency and reduce other benefits of digital trade, resulting in the fracturing, or so-called balkanization, of the internet. In addressing online privacy, some policymakers focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders. Such limits may also act as protectionist measures. Some see an inherent conflict between online security, privacy, and trade; others believe that policies protecting all three can be coherent and consistent. The U.S. government has traditionally sought to balance these objectives. Some stakeholders note, however, that current U.S. policy has been inadequate in protecting online privacy and that change is needed. In some cases in the past, Congress has acted to address privacy concerns in particular sectors; for example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 led to health privacy standards regulations. The Trump Administration has begun an effort to devise an overarching data privacy policy (see \"Defining the U.S. Approach\") and many Members of Congress are also considering possible approaches. There are no comprehensive multilateral rules specifically about privacy or cross-border data flows. However, the United States and other countries have begun to address these issues in negotiating new and updated trade agreements, and through international economic forums and organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The United States has contributed to developing international guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. The United States has played an important role in international discussions on privacy and data flows, such as in the OECD, G-20, and APEC, and has included provisions on these subjects in recent free trade agreements. Congress noted the importance of digital trade and the internet as a trading platform in setting the current U.S. trade negotiating objectives in the June 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation (P.L. 114-26). TPA includes a specific principal U.S. trade negotiating objective on \"digital trade in goods and services and cross-border data flows.\" According to TPA, a trade agreement should ensure that governments \"refrain from implementing trade-related measures that impede digital trade in goods and services, restrict cross-border data flows, or require local storage or processing of data.\" However, TPA also recognizes that sometimes measures are necessary to achieve legitimate policy objectives and aims for such regulations to be the least trade restrictive, nondiscriminatory, and transparent. The Trump Administration is seeking to define an overarching U.S. policy on data privacy. The Trump Administration's ongoing three-track process is being managed by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) in consultation with the White House. Different bureaus in Commerce are tasked with different aspects of the process, as follows. The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a privacy framework. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is developing a set of privacy principles to guide a domestic legal and policy approach. The International Trade Administration (ITA) engages with foreign governments and international organizations such as APEC. ITA is focusing on the international interoperability aspects of potential U.S. privacy policy. Congress may consider the trade-related aspects of data flows in trade agreements, including through close examination of these provisions during the congressional debate and consideration of legislation to implement the proposed USMCA. Issues include whether the agreements make progress in meeting TPA's related trade negotiating objectives and if the provisions strike the appropriate balance among public policy objectives. In addition, USTR's specific trade negotiating objectives for future agreements with the EU and Japan include establishing rules to protect cross-border data flows. These future trade negotiations present challenges and provide opportunities for Congress to further engage USTR on the issues and to conduct oversight.",
    "crs_R45120": "The Latin American and Caribbean region has made significant advances over the past three decades in terms of both political and economic development. In the early 1980s, 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries were governed by authoritarian regimes, both on the left and the right. Today, most governments are elected democracies, at least formally. The threat to elected governments from their own militaries has dissipated in most countries. Free and fair elections have become the norm in most countries in the region, although elections in several countries have been controversial and contested. In 2017, the Bahamas, Ecuador, and Chile held successful elections for heads of government. Elections in Honduras in November 2017, however, were characterized by significant irregularities, with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) calling for new elections to be held. Despite significant improvements in political rights and civil liberties, many countries in the region still face considerable challenges. In a number of countries, weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services, ensure accountability and transparency, advance the rule of law, and ensure citizen safety and security. There also are numerous examples of elected presidents over the past three decades who left office early amid severe social turmoil and economic crises, the presidents' own autocratic actions contributing to their ouster, or high-profile corruption. In recent years, the quality of democracy has eroded in several countries in the region. One factor contributing to this democratic erosion is increased organized crime. Organized crime has particularly affected Mexico and several Central American countries because of the increased use of the region as a drug transit zone and the associated rise in corruption, crime, and violence. A second factor negatively affecting democracy in several countries has been the executive's abuse of power. Elected leaders have sought to consolidate power at the expense of minority rights, leading to a setback in liberal democratic practices. Venezuela stands out in this regard, with the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro repressing the opposition with force and manipulating state institutions to retain power. Media freedom deteriorated in several countries in recent years, precipitated by the increase in organized crime-related violence and by politically driven attempts to curb critical or independent media. In 2018, several countries experienced significant political challenges. Peru's president resigned in March just ahead of a vote on impeachment on corruption charges. In Nicaragua, widespread protests against the government of President Daniel Ortega were suppressed violently, with over 300 people killed. In Brazil, far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro won the presidential race in October; given Bolosonaro's coarse campaign rhetoric, which included a vow to purge Brazil of leftist political opponents, many observers have concerns that his election could pose a threat to democracy and human rights.

    "crs_R45533": "The right to bail in noncapital cases has firm roots in the United States, dating back to colonial times and originating in English law. As the Supreme Court recognized, the \"traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense and prevents inflicting punishment prior to conviction.\" But the Supreme Court has never recognized a right to bail as absolute, and has held that the government may have legitimate interests in limiting the availability of bail, even for noncapital crimes, based not only on possible flight risk but also on other considerations, including the danger an arrestee poses to public safety or specific members of the community. Nonetheless, the Court has also observed that pretrial detention may have negative consequences for criminal defendants, such as by impairing their ability to maintain employment and to support dependents financially. The impact of state and municipal money-bail systems on indigent criminal defendants has prompted legislative interest in, and judicial challenges to, such systems. Money-bail systems allow defendants to avoid jail while awaiting trial by posting a bond according to a fee schedule. Typically, judges do not assess a detainee's individual characteristics beyond the offense charged; instead, judges set a defendant's bail based on the criminal offense with which he is charged. Defendants who cannot pay bail may remain detained pending trial. Money-bail systems differ from the federal bail system, which gives judicial officers greater discretion over the conditions of a defendant's pretrial release. Critics of state and municipal money-bail systems assert, among other things, that fee schedules unduly burden indigent defendants, who face more difficulty paying bail\u2014including relatively low bail fees associated with misdemeanor offenses\u2014than nonindigent defendants accused of similar offenses. Supporters, on the other hand, contend that fee schedules help guarantee a defendant's appearance in subsequent proceedings and treat defendants uniformly. In recent years, a few jurisdictions, including New Mexico, Kentucky, New Jersey, Colorado, and Maryland, have considered legislative proposals or ballot initiatives to eliminate or alter their money-bail systems. Some states, including California, Colorado, and New Jersey, altered their money-bail systems to employ more individualized risk assessment tools rather than using the nature of the offense charged. Recently, defendants have challenged various state or municipal bail systems as inconsistent with the Constitution's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. For example, in Jones v. City of Clanton (formerly Varden v. City of Clanton), the parties settled the case by making release on an unsecured bond the norm rather than the exception. Lawsuits in a few other local jurisdictions have similarly been settled. In Pierce v. City of Velda City, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri issued a declaratory judgment stating that \"no person may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, be held in custody after an arrest because the person is too poor to post a monetary bond.\" Subsequently, the parties entered a settlement agreement on a new bail policy. During the latter years of the Obama Administration, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest in litigation challenging the constitutionality of local bail systems. The DOJ filed an amicus brief in a civil rights lawsuit challenging bail amounts based solely on the offense, calling such systems unconstitutional because of their impact upon indigent defendants. As of the date of this report, it is unclear whether the DOJ and the Trump Administration will continue to take an active role in this case.",
    "crs_R44729": "On January 5, 2011, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment to House Rule XII to require that Members of the House state the constitutional basis for Congress's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution.

Article II, Section 2, appoints the President as the commander-in-chief, with the implied power to deploy, and redeploy, the armed forces as necessary for national defense. Through annual authorization and appropriation legislation, Congress legislates policy for managing DOD real property assets and funds the construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal of military infrastructure. The modern Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process refers to a temporary authority that amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-510), hereinafter referred to as the Base Closure Act, and features a framework of elements that entrusts an independent commission with certifying closure and realignment recommendations made by the Secretary of Defense. In general, the process has required the Secretary to submit a list of military installations recommended for closure or realignment to an independent, bipartisan BRAC commission. After analyzing the Secretary's recommendations, the commission may accept, reject, or modify the list. Upon completing its review, the commission forwards its final findings and recommendations to the President. Upon acceptance of commission's recommendations, the President then submits them to Congress. If the President does not submit the recommendations to Congress within the timeframe required under the Base Closure Act, the BRAC process is terminated. Upon receipt of the report from the President, Congress has the opportunity to disapprove of the recommendations in toto through the enactment of a joint resolution. The hallmarks of this framework include establishment of an independent commission whose members are appointed by the President, in consultation with congressional leadership (and the advice and consent of the Senate); reliance on objective and uniform criteria for evaluating basing recommendations; GAO review and certification of DOD data; deliberations that include open hearings, solicitation of feedback, installation visits, and data available for public review; requirement that the commission's final list of closure and realignment actions be accepted or rejected in its entirety; and presidential and congressional off-ramps that would terminate the BRAC process when certain conditions are not met. The timeline to complete an entire BRAC round has varied; however, the most recent one conducted in 2005 took approximately 10 years, from authorization to completion (end of the six-year BRAC implementation period). Key milestones of a typical BRAC timeline include DOD force structure plan, infrastructure inventory, and analysis of options (up to four years); nomination and confirmation of BRAC commissioners; DOD submission of BRAC recommendations (and associated reports) to the commission; commission deliberations (typically four months); final report sent to the President for approval; 45-day deadline for Congress to reject recommendations in their entirety (Joint Resolution of Disapproval) or allow implementation to begin; DOD implementation (two years to begin; six years to complete); and DOD disposal of real property (indeterminate). The BRAC process is the chief means by which DOD disposes of excess infrastructure. Each year between 2013 and 2017, the Department requested a new BRAC round as a means of realizing greater efficiency and reducing excess infrastructure. It has also attempted to allay concerns related to the 2005 BRAC experience - marked by unexpectedly high costs and complexity - by emphasizing cost savings and efficiencies rather than force transformation. In April 2016, DOD submitted to the House Armed Services Committee an infrastructure capacity report (interim version) that assessed 22% of the Department's base infrastructure excess to its needs. The methodology used in the report\u2014required by Section 2815 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2016 (P.L. 114-92)\u2014remained consistent with excess capacity reports submitted prior to the 1998 and 2005 BRAC rounds round. The Department concluded its infrastructure capacity analysis by arguing it had established sufficient justification for a new BRAC round, a process that would allow it to more effectively dispose of excess infrastructure and manage remaining real property assets. The Department has periodically proposed legislative language that would constrain the Secretary's ability to recommend BRAC actions that would not yield savings within 20 years and to emphasize recommendations that would yield net savings within five years. The Department has periodically proposed legislative language that would constrain the Secretary's ability to recommend BRAC actions that would not yield savings within 20 years and to emphasize recommendations that would yield net savings within five years.

    "crs_R43429": "Federal land management decisions influence the U.S. economy, environment, and social welfare. These decisions determine how the nation's federal lands will be acquired or disposed of, developed, managed, and protected. Their impact may be local, regional, or national. This report discusses selected federal land policy issues that the 116th Congress may consider through oversight, authorizations, or appropriations. The report also identifies CRS products that provide more detailed information. The federal government manages roughly 640 million acres of surface land, approximately 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States. Four agencies (referred to in this report as the federal land management agencies, or FLMAs) administer a total of 608 million acres (95%) of these federal lands: the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI). Most of these lands are in the West and Alaska, where the percentage of federal ownership is significantly higher than elsewhere in the nation. In addition, the Department of Defense administers approximately 11 million acres in military bases, training ranges, and more; and numerous other agencies administer the remaining federal acreage. The federal estate also extends to energy and mineral resources located below ground and offshore. BLM manages the federal onshore subsurface mineral estate. The Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM), also in DOI, manages access to about 1.7 billion offshore acres located beyond state coastal waters, referred to as U.S. offshore areas or the outer continental shelf (OCS). Not all of these acres can be expected to contain extractable mineral and energy resources, however. Federal land policy and management issues generally fall into several broad thematic questions: Should federal land be managed to produce national or local benefits? How should current uses be balanced with future resources and opportunities? Should current uses, management, and protection programs be replaced with alternatives? Who decides how federal land resources should be managed, and how are the decisions made? Some stakeholders seek to maintain or enhance the federal estate, while others seek to divest the federal estate to state or private ownership. Some issues, such as forest management and fire protection, involve both federal and nonfederal (state, local, or privately owned) land. In many cases, policy positions on federal land issues do not divide along clear party lines. Instead, they may be split along the lines of rural-urban, eastern-western, and coastal-interior interests. Several committees in the House and Senate have jurisdiction over federal land issues. For example, issues involving the management of the national forests cross multiple committee jurisdictions, including the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Natural Resources in the House, and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate. In addition, federal land issues are often addressed during consideration of annual appropriations for the FLMAs' programs and activities. These agencies and programs typically receive appropriations through annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws. This report introduces selected federal land issues, many of which are complex and interrelated. The discussions are broad and aim to introduce the range of issues regarding federal land management, while providing references to more detailed and specific CRS products. The issues are grouped into these broad categories Federal Estate Ownership, Funding Issues Related to Federal Lands, Climate Policy and Federal Land Management, Energy and Minerals Resources, Forest Management, Range Management, Recreation, Other Land Designations, Species Management, and Wildfire Management.

When comparing the Administration's FY2019 request to the FY2018 funding, it should be considered that the Administration formulated its FY2019 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. FY2018 funding levels, for the purposes of the Administration's request, were calculated based on FY2017 funding minus a reduction (0.6791%) as extended under a series of continuing resolutions. The Administration requested the following: $9.797 billion for the Department of Commerce, which was 12.0% less than FY2018 regular funding; $28.835 billion for the Department of Justice, which was 4.8% less than FY2018 regular funding; $27.372 billion for the science agencies, which was 4.0% less than FY2018 regular funding; and $551 million for the related agencies, which was 43.4% less than FY2018 regular funding. The Administration's FY2019 budget for CJS proposed eliminating several agencies and programs: the Economic Development Administration (EDA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the Community Relations Service (its functions would have been moved to DOJ's Civil Rights Division), the COPS Office (grants managed by the COPS Office would have been moved to OJP), NASA's Education program, and the Legal Services Corporation. The Administration requested some funding for the EDA and Legal Services Corporation for what would have been an orderly closeout of these agencies had Congress adopted the Administration's proposal. The Administration's budget also proposed to move funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Currently, HIDTA funding is administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. On February 15, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6), which includes $72.908 billion for CJS. The act includes the following: $11.414 billion for the Department of Commerce, which is 2.5% more than regular FY2018 funding and 16.5% more than the Administration's request; $30.934 billion for the Department of Justice, which is 2.1% more than regular FY2018 funding and 7.3% more than the Administration's request; $29.583 billion for the science agencies, which is 3.8% more than regular FY2018 funding and 8.1% more than the Administration's request; and $977 million for the related agencies, which is 0.3% more than regular FY2018 funding and 77.3% more than the Administration's request.",
    "crs_R44533": "Qatar is a sovereign state of the Gulf of the Arabian Peninsula (GCC), a region that has been governed by a hereditary Amir (literally \"prince,\" but interpreted as \"ruler\"), Shaykh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The Amir governs through a prime minister, who is a member of the Al Thani family, and a cabinet, several of whom are members of the Al Thani family or of prominent allied families. Amir Tamim serves concurrently as Minister of Defense, although most of the defense policy functions are performed by the Minister of State for Defense, a position with less authority than that of full minister. In November 2014, Amir Tamim appointed a younger brother, Shaykh Abdullah bin Hamad, to be deputy Amir and the heir apparent. The Prime Minister, Shaykh Abdullah bin Nasir bin Khalifa Al Thani, also serves as Interior Minister. Qatar uses its financial resources to implement a foreign policy that engages a wide range of regional actors, including those that are at odds with each other. Qatari officials periodically meet with Israeli officials while at the same hosting leaders of the Palestinian militant group, Hamas. Qatar maintains consistent ties to Iran while at the same time hosting U.S. forces that contain Iran's military power. Qatar hosts an office of the Afghan Taliban movement that facilitates U.S.-Taliban talks. Its policies have enabled Qatar to mediate some regional conflicts and to obtain the freedom of captives held by regional armed groups. Yet, Qatar often backs regional actors at odds with those backed by de facto GCC leader Saudi Arabia and other GCC states, causing Saudi Arabia and its close allies in the GCC to accuse Qatar of undermining the other GCC countries. As have some of the other GCC states, Qatar has shown an increasing willingness to use its own military forces to try to shape the outcome of regional conflicts. Qatar's disputes with other GCC states have come despite the resolution in 2011 of a long-standing territorial dispute between Bahrain, dating back to the 18th century, when the ruling families of both countries controlled parts of the Arabian peninsula. Qatari forces and commanders have been participating in GCC \"Gulf Shield\" military exercises and command meetings in Saudi Arabia and other GCC states. Amir Tamim was invited by Saudi Arabia to the annual GCC summit in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, during December 7-9, 2018, but he did not attend. Qatar asserts that the blockading countries are seeking to change Qatar's leadership and might take military action to force Qatar to accept their demands. The dispute has to date thwarted U.S. efforts to assemble the a new \"Middle East Strategic Alliance\" to counter Iran and regional terrorist groups. This alliance \u2013 to consist of the United States, the GCC countries, and other Sunni-led states, is reportedly to be formally unveiled at U.S.-GCC summit that has been repeatedly postponed since early 2018 and is not scheduled. The MESA has also been hampered by the global criticism of Saudi de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for his possible involvement in the October 2018 killing of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Kashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and Egypt's April 2019 decision to refrain from joining the Alliance. Qatar's defense and security relations are long-standing and extensive\u2014a characterization emphasized by senior U.S. officials in the course of the two U.S.-Qatar \"Strategic Dialogue\" sessions\u2014in Washington, DC, in January 2018, and in Doha in January 2019. Senior U.S. officials have praised Qatar as \"a longtime friend and military partner for peace and stability in the Middle East and a supporter of NATO's mission in Afghanistan.\" The U.S.-Qatar defense relationship emerged during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. The six Gulf monarchies formed the GCC in late 1981 and collectively backed Iraq against the threat posed by Iran in that war, despite their political and ideological differences with Iraq's Saddam Husein. In the latter stages of that war, Iran attacked international shipping in the Gulf and some Gulf state oil loading facilities, but none in Qatar. After Iraq invaded GCC member Kuwait in August 1990, the GCC participated in the U.S.-led military coalition that expelled Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. In January 1991, Qatari armored forces helped coalition troops defeat an Iraqi attack on the Saudi town of Khafji",
    "crs_R45716": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has become increasingly aware of the need to use electronic payment systems. Various electronic payment systems have become so effective and inexpensive relative to cash payments that some U.S. businesses\u2014even those at which sales generally have a low dollar value\u2014are increasingly choosing not to accept cash. In some developed countries, such as Sweden, cash payments are becoming relatively scarce. In addition, a number of central banks worldwide are examining the possibility of issuing government-backed digital currencies that exist only electronically. These trends suggest that due to buyer or seller preference or government policy, the role of cash in the payment system may continue to decline, perhaps significantly, in coming years. Some observers have examined the consequences of an evolution away from cash. Proponents of reducing the use of physical currency (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that it will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Proponents of maintaining cash as a payment option argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial system's vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Given developments and debate in this area, Congress may consider policy issues related to the declining use of cash relative to electronic forms of payment. This report is divided into two parts. The first part analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, and the second analyzes potential outcomes if cash were to be significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment. The first part describes the characteristics of cash and the various electronic payment systems that could potentially supplant cash. The noncash payment systems include traditional electronic payment systems (such as credit cards or payment apps) and alternative electronic payment systems, focusing on private systems using distributed ledger technology (such as cryptocurrencies) and central bank digital currencies (which are only under consideration by central banks at this time). Part I also examines the advantages and costs specific to each payment system and the potential obstacles to the adoption of alternative electronic payment systems. Part II of this report analyzes the potential implications of a reduced role of cash payments in the economy, including potential benefits, costs, and risks. The report also includes an Appendix that presents two international case studies of economies in which noncash payment systems rapidly expanded.",
    "crs_R45489": "The number of individuals living in the United States who were born in the Northern Triangle grew from 2.2 million to almost 3 million; this increase (37%) was more than twice the increase for the total foreign-born population (16%). During the same period, the foreign-born population from Mexico living in the United States held steady at 11.5 million (which is more than any other country-of-birth group). In 2016, the foreign-born population from the Northern Triangle comprised less than 1.0% of the U.S. population and 6.8% of the 43.7 million foreign-born residents of the United States, up from 5.8% in 2006. Even though total apprehensions of illegal border crossers were at a 45-year low in FY2017, the number of families from the Northern Triangle apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border has increased in recent years. While earlier migrants apprehended at the Southwest border were predominantly single, adult males from Mexico, currently the majority of apprehended migrants are families and unaccompanied children, and the majority of apprehended migrants come from the Northern Triangle. An increasing share of those arriving at the Southwest border are requesting asylum, some at official ports of entry and others after entering the United States \"without inspection\" (i.e., illegally) between U.S. ports of entry. This is adding to a large backlog of asylum cases in U.S. immigration courts. In the past year, news reports of migrant \"caravans\" from the Northern Triangle traveling toward the U.S. border have sparked intense interest and many questions from Congress, including the following: What factors are contributing to the increase in migration from the Northern Triangle to the United States? Is the choice to migrate in large groups a new trend? How are the United States, Mexico, and Central American governments responding? How are U.S. policies at the border\u2014including security screening, removal proceedings, military involvement, and asylum processing\u2014being implemented? This report addresses these and other frequently asked questions.",

The executive branch includes two other service classifications\u2014the excepted service and the Senior Executive Service (SES)\u2014with hiring and removal standards that diverge from those prescribed for the competitive service. Positions in the excepted service are specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute, by the President, or by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). SES positions are also not in the competitive service.

    "crs_R45657": "Political and economic developments in Cuba and U.S. policy toward the island nation, located 90 miles from the United States, have been significant congressional concerns for many years. Especially since the end of the Cold War, Congress has played an active role in shaping U.S. policy toward Cuba, first with the enactment of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 (CDA; P.L. 102-484, Title XVII) and then with the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-114). Both measures tightened U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s; however, both measures also provided road maps for normalization of relations, dependent on significant political and economic changes in Cuba. Congress partially modified its sanctions-based policy toward Cuba when it enacted the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA; P.L. 106-387, Title IX) allowing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. Over the past decade, much of the debate in Congress over U.S. policy has focused on U.S. sanctions. In 2009, Congress took legislative action in an appropriations measure (P.L. 111-8) to ease restrictions on family travel and travel for the marketing of agricultural exports, marking the first congressional action easing Cuba sanctions in almost a decade. The Obama Administration took further action in 2009 by lifting restrictions on family travel and family remittances and in 2011 by further easing restrictions on educational and religious travel and remittances to other than family members. President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba in December 2014 that moved away from a sanctions-based policy aimed at isolating Cuba toward a policy of engagement and a normalization of relations. The policy shift led to the restoration of diplomatic relations, the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism, and the easing of some restrictions on travel and commerce with Cuba. There was mixed reaction in Congress, with some Members of Congress supporting the change and others opposing it. Legislative initiatives in the 114th Congress in 2015-2016 reflected this policy divide, with some bills introduced that would have further eased U.S. economic sanctions and others that would have blocked the policy shift and introduced new sanctions; ultimately no action was taken on either policy approach. President Trump announced a new policy approach toward Cuba in June 2017 that partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on the permissible category of people-to-people educational travel to Cuba and on transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military. Again, reaction in the 115th Congress in 2017-2018 was mixed, with legislative initiatives reflecting the policy divide between those wanting to tighten sanctions and those wanting to ease them. Ultimately the only legislative action taken with regard to sanctions was a provision in the 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-344) that permits funding for two U.S. agricultural exports promotion programs in Cuba. This marked the first time Congress had eased Cuba sanctions, albeit slightly, in almost a decade.",

This report lists a comprehensive chronology of official activities in response to incidents of military sexual assault, as well as legislative action on the issue. The report is divided into three sections: the DOD and the Obama Administration's actions, congressional action, and legislation in the 113th (2013-2014) and 114th (2015-2016) Congresses.

    "crs_R45388": "Since the onset of the nation's civil war and ensuing military coup d'\u00e9tat in 1962, Burma's military, or Tatmadaw, and its associated security forces, such as the Border Guard Police and the Myanmar Police Force, have been repeatedly accused of committing murder, rape, and torture against the nation's various ethnic minorities. Between 1990 and 2008, Congress passed legislation imposing various sanctions on Burma in part due to the serious human rights violations committed by and/or authorized by the Tatmadaw. Such allegations of intentional, pervasive, and systematic abuses arose again following the forced displacement of over 700,000 Rohingya from Burma's Rakhine State in late 2017, as well as the Tatmadaw's renewed offensive against ethnic armed groups in Kachin, Karen, and Shan States. The Trump Administration has described that Tatmadaw's assault on the Rohingya as \"ethnic cleansing\" and has applied \"limited targeted sanctions\" on five Tatmadaw officers and two military units. On December 13, 2018, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 1091 (116th Congress) by a vote of 394-1, stating \"the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military and security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against humanity and genocide\" and calling on the Secretary of State to \"determine, based on available evidence, whether the actions by the Burmese military in northern Rakhine State in 2017 constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, or other crimes under international law.\" Various organizations\u2014including the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission in Myanmar (UNFFM), multiple human rights organizations, and the press\u2014have conducted investigations into allegations that Burmese security forces committed serious human rights violations in Burma's seven ethnic states since the Tatmadaw transferred power to a mixed civilian/military government in 2011. These organizations have released at least 17 reports documenting evidence that appears to support some of these allegations, and implicates specific Burmese security personnel and units as being responsible for the abuses. In addition to concluding that Burmese security forces were responsible for serious human rights violations, at least two of these reports maintain that the violations were intentional, premeditated, and systemic. Certain Burmese officers and units also appear in more than one report, and in some cases, are identified as being responsible for human rights violations in more than one ethnic state and/or at different times. The reports vary in their conclusions on the severity of the abuses. Some conclude that certain violations may constitute genocide; in other cases, some describe possible war crimes or crimes against humanity. This report compiles a list\u2014in tabular form\u2014of the Burmese security personnel and units that have been identified as responsible for serious human rights violations by one or more the following reports: 1.

    "crs_R45248": "The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review certain types of federal agency actions that fall under the statutory category of \"rules.\" Enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the CRA requires agencies to report the issuance of \"rules\" to Congress and provides Congress with special procedures under which to consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a \"rule\" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The 115th Congress used the CRA to pass, for the first time, a resolution of disapproval overturning an agency guidance document that had not been promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures. The resolution was signed into law by the President on May 21, 2018. In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes. Congress's use of the CRA in this instance raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. Under the CRA, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn rules become available only when agencies submit their rules to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that meet the legal definition of a \"rule\" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, however, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can use the CRA's procedures to overturn agency actions when an agency does not submit the action to Congress. This report first describes what types of agency actions can be overturned using the CRA by providing a close examination and discussion of the statutory definition of \"rule.\" The report then explains how Members can use the CRA to overturn agency rules that have not been submitted to Congress.",
    "crs_R45479": "The Supreme Court's decision in Skilling v. United States, which narrowly construed the scope of honest services fraud, has prompted some commentators to question the scope of the statute. Nevertheless, some commentators have continued to lament what they view as the Supreme Court's blunting of a previously sharp weapon to combat public corruption, arguing that the decisions in Skilling placed too little weight on \"the interests of citizens in honest government\" and urging Congress to find a legislative fix. Other observers, however, have suggested that the deleterious impact of the decisions is overstated, pointing out that federal prosecutors still have multiple legal avenues through which to combat corruption in the public sphere. In any event, should Congress revisit and reconsider the scope of 18 U.S.C.  1346, understanding the vagueness and federalism concerns that have animated the Supreme Court's repeated limiting constructions of the statute may be beneficial to preventing further judicial limitations. One place to start would be the Skilling Court's identification of some questions that must be answered if Congress seeks to \"take up the enterprise of criminalizing undisclosed self-dealing.......... These questions include (1) how \"direct or significant\" a conflicting financial interest must be; (2) the extent to which an \"official\" act or action must further the conflicting financial interest in order to constitute fraud; and (3) to whom a disclosure must be made, and what information it must contain, for a conflicted official to avoid criminal liability. Answering these questions in any proposed legislation may go a long way toward achieving the \"definiteness and specificity\" needed to potentially avoid the vagueness and federalism concerns that the Court has repeatedly articulated.",
    "crs_R45345": "Whistleblowing is \"the act of reporting waste, fraud, abuse and corruption in a lawful manner to those who can correct the wrongdoing.\" Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblowers are those employees or contractors working in any of the 17 elements of the IC who reasonably believe there has been a violation of law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; waste of resources; abuse of authority; or a substantial danger to public health and safety. The essential distinction between whistleblowers generally and those in the IC (or those who otherwise have security clearances) is the concern for protecting classified information that may be involved in an IC-related incident or complaint. The IC has recognized that whistleblowing can save taxpayers' dollars, help ensure an ethical and safe working environment, and enable timely responses for corrective action. Whistleblowing protections for employees and contractors in the IC are extended only to those who make a lawful disclosure. They do not cover disclosures that do not conform to statutes and directives prescribing reporting procedures intended to protect classified information, such as leaking to the media or a foreign government. The whistleblower protections do not apply to a difference of opinion over policy, strategy, analysis, or priorities for intelligence funding or collection unless there is a reasonable concern over legality or constitutionality. Whistleblowing protections also do not protect against legitimate adverse personnel or security clearance eligibility decisions if the agency can demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of a protected disclosure. Congress and the executive branch have defined in statute and directives procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures that also provide for the security of classified information. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) whistleblowing policy and guidance is publicly available and specifically addresses whistleblower process and protections for IC contractors, members of the Armed Forces, and federal employees. There are differing opinions, however, on whether the IC's internal processes have the transparency necessary to ensure adequate protections against reprisal, and whether protections for IC contractors are sufficient. IC whistleblower protections have evolved in response to perceptions of gaps that many believed left whistleblowers vulnerable to reprisal. The first whistleblower legislation specific to the IC was the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998. It was limited to specifying a process for an IC whistleblower to make a complaint but offered no specific protections. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 included provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers, though these were general and subject to different standards of implementation. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, signed in 2012, provided the first specific protections in response to perceptions that IC whistleblowers remained vulnerable to reprisal actions for making a complaint. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 codified the PPD-19 provisions and Intelligence Community Directive (ICD)-120 established a PPD-19 implementation policy. For members of the Armed Forces assigned to elements of the IC, 10 U.S.C. 1034 provides whistleblower protections. Department of Defense (DOD) implementing guidance for Section 1034 can be found in DOD Directive 7050.06, Military Whistleblower Protection. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which included Section 110 provisions to address perceived gaps in protections for IC contractors.",
    "crs_R42566": "A range of federal incentives supports the development and deployment of alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation. These incentives include tax deductions and credits for vehicle purchases and the installation of refueling systems, federal grants for conversion of older vehicles to newer technologies, mandates for the use of biofuels, and incentives for manufacturers to produce alternative fuel vehicles. Some of these incentives have expired in recent years when their authorizations expired. Many of the policy choices presented for alternative fuel and advanced vehicle technologies originated as a response to the nation's interest in reducing petroleum imports, a goal first articulated at the time of the two oil embargoes imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the 1970s. While President Richard Nixon is often cited as the first President to call for \"energy independence,\" successive Presidents and Congresses have made efforts to reduce petroleum import dependence as well. Factors in this reversal include the last recession, which reduced domestic demand, followed by a rise in the supply of U.S. oil and oil alternatives due to increased private sector investment and federal incentives, some of which are cited in this report. In addition, the United States has become a net exporter of petroleum products (while it remains a net importer of crude oil). With declining U.S. import dependence, reliance on petroleum and petroleum products may be less of a factor in promoting alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles in the future. Alternative fuels programs can be generally classified into six categories: expanding domestic ethanol production; establishing other alternative fuels; encouraging the purchase of nonpetroleum vehicles; reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions; supporting U.S. vehicle manufacturing; and funding U.S. highways.",
    "crs_R45715": "The 116th Congress continues its interest in U.S. research and development (R&D) and in evaluating support for federal R&D activities. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites, shale gas extraction, and defenses against disease. In recent years, widespread concerns about the federal debt, recent and projected federal budget deficits, and federal budget caps have driven difficult decisions about the prioritization of R&D, both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R&D portfolio. Increases in the budget caps for FY2018 and FY2019 reduced some of the pressure affecting these decisions, but the concerns remain and the caps for FY2020 have not been increased. The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering R&D. Its purposes include specific concerns such as addressing national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of individual funding agencies. The federal R&D budget is an aggregation of the R&D activities of these agencies. There is no single, centralized source of R&D funds. Agency R&D budgets are developed internally as part of each agency's overall budget development process. R&D funding may be included either in accounts that are entirely devoted to R&D or in accounts that include funding for non-R&D activities. Agency budgets are subjected to review, revision, and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and become part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress. The federal R&D budget is then calculated by aggregating the R&D activities of each federal agency. Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities as it makes decisions about the level and allocation of R&D funding\u2014overall, within agencies, and for specific programs. In recent years, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending (for R&D and for other purposes) in light of the federal deficit and debt. Other Members of Congress have expressed support for increased federal spending for R&D as an investment in the nation's future competitiveness. As Congress acts to complete the FY2020 appropriations process, it faces two overarching issues: the amount of the federal budget to be spent on federal R&D and the prioritization and allocation of the available funding. This report begins with a discussion of the overall level of R&D in President Trump's FY2020 budget request, followed by analyses of R&D funding in the request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency R&D initiatives. The remainder of the report discusses and analyzes the R&D budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that, collectively, account for approximately 99% of total federal R&D funding. Selected terms associated with federal R&D funding are defined in the text box on the next page.",

The bill typically funds mandatory retirement accounts in Title VI, which also contains additional general provisions applying to the funding provided to agencies through the FSGG bill. Title VII typically contains general provisions applying government-wide. The FSGG bill has also often contained provisions relating to the U.S. policy toward Cuba. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. Where the CFTC is funded upon enactment, the enacted amounts for the CFTC typically are in the Agriculture appropriations bill one year and FSGG the following year. This structure has existed in its current form since the 2007 reorganization of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Although financial services are a major focus of the bill, the bill does not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are instead funded outside of the appropriations process. It is not uncommon for legislative provisions addressing various financial regulatory issues to be included in titles at the end of the bill. The 115th Congress enacted P.L. 116-6, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, which included $45.7 billion in FSGG funding, including the CFTC.

    "crs_R45492": "The 116th Congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorizations and appropriations legislation related to water resource development, management, and protection. Demands on available water supplies have heightened local and regional water-use conflicts throughout the country, particularly in the West and Southeast. Development pressures, droughts and floods, and concerns about changing hydrology have engender nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects. There is interest in new water resource infrastructure (e.g., storm surge gates, water storage) and new kinds of projects (e.g., groundwater recharge projects, nature-based flood risk reduction). In addition, there is interest in reinvestment in aging water resource infrastructure and in improved management of available supplies through water science, monitoring, and operational changes. Water resource policy questions relevant to the 116th Congress include the following: What will be the federal role in maintaining the performance and safety of existing water resource infrastructure? Under what conditions and how should the federal government be involved in planning and constructing water resource projects? How may federal and nonfederal water resource science, observation, and monitoring be performed and used to inform water resource management and project design and operation? The 116th Congress may consider some measures proposed but not enacted in the 115th Congress, as well as new legislative proposals. In the water resource area, legislative activity often is specific to the federal water resource management agencies or to water use by particular sectors, including energy, agriculture, navigation, recreation, and municipal and industrial use. Occasionally, Congress takes up broader water resource policy issues, such as coordination of federal water resource activities, programs, science, and research. Congress and other decisionmakers often make water resource decisions within a complicated context. These decisions may involve existing federal infrastructure and their beneficiaries, multiple or conflicting objectives, various legal decisions, multiple environmental and natural resource statutes, and long-established institutional mechanisms (e.g., water rights and contractual obligations). These decisions also occur within a federalist framework in which water resource responsibilities are shared with state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector.",

Successive U.S. Administrations have viewed U.S. leadership of NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security strategy, bringing benefits ranging from peace and stability in Europe to the political and military support of 28 allies, including many of the world's most advanced militaries. For almost as long as NATO has been in existence, it also has faced criticism. One chief concern of critics in the United States, including some Members of Congress, has been that European allies' reliance on U.S. security guarantees have fostered an imbalanced and unsustainable \"burdensharing\" arrangement by which the United States carries an unfair share of the responsibility for ensuring European security. President Donald Trump has amplified these concerns, and his assertions that NATO is a \"bad deal\" have caused some analysts and policymakers to reassess the costs and benefits to the United States of its long-standing leadership of the alliance. Although successive U.S. presidents have called on the allies to increase defense spending, none has done so as stridently as President Trump.

    "crs_R45516": "The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program provides long-term, low-interest loans and other types of credit assistance for the construction of surface transportation projects. The TIFIA program prog ram, administered by the Build America Bureau of the Department of Transportation (DOT), was reauthorized most recently in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-94) from FY2016 through FY2020. Direct funding for the TIFIA program to make loans is authorized at $300 million for each of FY2019 and FY2020, but state departments of transportation can also use federal-aid highway grant money, both formula and discretionary, to subsidize much larger loans. The primary goal of the TIFIA program, historically, has been to enable the construction of large-scale surface transportation projects by providing low-interest, long-term financing to complement state, local, and private investment. The TIFIA program has been one of the main ways in which the federal government has encouraged the development of public-private partnerships (P3s) and private financing in surface transportation often backed by new, but sometimes uncertain, revenue sources such as highway tolls, other types of user charges, and incremental real estate taxes. Since its enactment in 1998 as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178) through FY2018, the TIFIA program has provided assistance of $32 billion to 74 projects with a total cost of about $117 billion (in FY2018 inflation-adjusted dollars). Congress has used the TIFIA program as a model for other initiatives, notably the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers. Several recent proposals would expand TIFIA assistance. For example, the Trump Administration's $200 billion infrastructure plan, based on leveraging state, local, and private resources, proposed adding several billion dollars of budget authority for TIFIA and expanding eligibility to ports and airports. The experience of TIFIA over the past decade shows, however, that there are limits to financing projects in this way. These limits include the number of projects that can take advantage of credit assistance, the difficulties of developing revenue mechanisms to service loans, the typical need for grant funding to make up a portion of the capital, and the difficulties of attracting private investment to risky projects, particularly those for which demand is uncertain or hard to predict.

    "crs_R44618": "The Second Amendment states that \"[a] well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" Before the Supreme Court's 2008 opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, the right generally had been understood by federal courts to be intertwined with military or militia use. That understanding was formed with little Supreme Court guidance: Before Heller, the Supreme Court had barely opined on the scope of the Second Amendment, making its last substantive remarks on the right in its 1939 ruling in United States v. Miller. In Miller, the Supreme Court evaluated a criminal law banning possession of a certain type of firearm, asking whether it bore a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\" such that it garnered Second Amendment protection. This passage spawned a longstanding debate over whether the Second Amendment provides an individual right to keep and bear arms versus a collective right belonging to the states to maintain militias, with the vast majority of the courts embracing the collective right theory. Indeed, before the Heller litigation began only one circuit court\u2014the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Emerson\u2014had concluded that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court's landmark 5-4 decision in Heller upturned the earlier majority view with its holding that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess firearms for historically lawful purposes, such as self-defense in the home. But in Heller the Court did not define the full scope of that right, leaving lower courts to fill in the gaps. Indeed, the Court has said little on the matter, most notably by holding that the Second Amendment right is incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment to apply to the states in McDonald v. City of Chicago. Beyond McDonald, the Court has largely declined to grant certiorari to the numerous Second Amendment cases percolating in the lower federal courts with one exception: In Caetano v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court\u2014in a single, two page ruling\u2014granted a petition for certiorari and issued an unsigned, per curiam opinion vacating the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court that had upheld a state law prohibiting the possession of stun guns. But the Court's opinion did little to clarify Second Amendment jurisprudence, principally noting that the state court opinion directly conflicted with Heller without discussing the matter in further detail. During the October 2019 term, however, the Supreme Court will review a Second Amendment challenge to a New York City firearm licensing provision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. City of New York, giving the Court another opportunity to elaborate on the scope of the individual right to keep and bear arms. Accordingly, this report evaluates how the lower federal courts have interpreted Heller and the Second Amendment through challenges to various federal, state, and local firearm laws. In particular, this report focuses on federal appellate decisions, including what categories of persons, firearms, and places may be subject to government firearm regulation, and how federal, state, and local governments may regulate those categories. These appellate decisions include challenges to provisions of the Gun Control Act\u2014the primary federal law regulating the transfer and possession of firearms in interstate commerce\u2014as well as state and local laws that provide further restrictions on the possession and sale of firearms, including assault weapon bans, concealed carry restrictions, and firearm licensing schemes, among others. This report is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of every Second Amendment issue brought in federal court since Heller, but highlights notable challenges to firearm laws that may be of interest to Congress.",

Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In general, the PMAs came into being because of the government's need to dispose of electric power produced by federal dams constructed largely for irrigation, flood control, or other purposes, and to achieve small community and farm electrification\u2014that is, providing service to customers whom it would not have been profitable for a private utility to serve. With minor exceptions, these agencies market the electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives (e.g., \"preference customers\"), selling their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles.

    "crs_RL34591": "The federal government has played a role in subsidizing housing construction and providing homeownership and rental assistance for lower-income households since the 1930s. Today, Congress funds a number of programs to help meet the housing needs of poor and vulnerable populations. The programs are primarily administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with some assistance provided to rural communities through the Department of Agriculture and some tax benefits administered through the Department of the Treasury. The modern housing assistance programs include both relatively flexible grants to state and local governments to serve homeless people, build affordable housing, provide assistance to first-time homebuyers, and promote community development; and more structured, direct assistance programs that provide low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to poor families, administered through local public, quasi-public, and private intermediaries. The federal government also makes tax credits available to states to distribute to developers of low-cost housing and provides mortgage insurance to lenders that make certain types of mortgages to eligible homebuyers or developers of multifamily housing. One of the federal government's largest housing benefits, arguably, is the mortgage interest deduction, which is not targeted to lower-income households and is available to homeowners who pay mortgage interest and itemize their deductions.

    "crs_R45625": "The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, concluded that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future\u2014but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse g as [GHG] emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.\" A carbon tax is one policy option to address U.S. GHG emission levels, which contribute to climate change and related impacts. Economic modeling indicates that a carbon tax would achieve emission reductions, the level of which would depend on which GHG emissions and sources are covered and the rate of the carbon tax. A carbon tax would generate a new revenue stream. The magnitude of the revenues would depend on the scope and rate of the tax and multiple market factors, which introduce uncertainty in the revenue projections. A 2018 CBO study estimated that a $25/metric ton tax on CO2 emissions from energy-related activities and other selected GHG emission sources would yield approximately $100 billion in the first year of the program. To put this estimate in context, the CBO projected that total federal revenue would be $3.5 trillion in FY2019. Policymakers would face several key design decisions, including the point of taxation\u2014where to impose the tax and what to tax\u2014the rate of taxation, and whether and/or how to address imported carbon-intensive materials. Alternatively, Congress could direct one or more federal agencies to determine these design features through a rulemaking procedure. Although a few of the GHG emission reduction proposals in prior Congresses delegated such authority to an agency, all of the proposals since the 111th Congress have included some degree of design details in the statutory language. Policymakers might consider a carbon tax as a fiscal tool to help reduce the federal deficit, reduce other taxes, or pay for specific programs that may or may not be related to climate change policy. In addition, some have proposed a phased-in approach, setting a rate that is initially lower but increases at an announced or adjustable rate either for a fixed period or indefinitely. Advantages of this approach include providing an opportunity for consumers and investors to adjust their behavior before the higher tax rates go into effect, such as purchasing more energy efficient appliances or investing in low-emissions technologies. Phasing in a carbon tax, however, could delay climate-related benefits. If Congress finds agreement in principle on carbon pricing, the rate(s) could emerge from the process of reaching political agreement. Elements that might be considered include the options described above or consideration of the magnitude of overall economic impact; impacts on certain economic sectors, regions, or population groups; timing to motivate and allow an orderly transition to a lower-GHG economy; or other factors. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Economic models indicate that certain distributions of tax revenue\u2014depending on the level of the tax\u2014would have a greater economic impact than the direct effects from the tax or fee on GHG emissions. Carbon tax revenues could be treated as general fund revenue without a dedication to a specific purpose in the enacting legislation (i.e., subject to the annual appropriations process), or policymakers could state that the new revenues would support deficit (or debt) reduction. Alternatively, the enacting legislation could return the tax revenue to the economy in some manner, sometimes called \"revenue recycling.\" All of the carbon tax legislative proposals in recent Congresses have proposed some manner of revenue recycling, specifically directing the carbon tax revenue to support specific policy objectives. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. A primary concern with a carbon tax is the potential economy-wide costs that may result. The potential costs would depend on a number of factors, including the magnitude, design, and use of revenues of the carbon tax. In general, economic literature finds that some of the modeled revenue applications would reduce the economy-wide costs imposed by a carbon tax but may not eliminate them entirely. Policymakers could apply the tax revenues to support a range of policy objectives. When deciding how to allocate the revenues, policymakers would encounter trade-offs among objectives. The central trade-offs involve minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups\u2014particularly low-income households\u2014and supporting a range of specific policy objectives.

These pipelines are geographically widespread, running alternately through remote and densely populated regions\u2014from Arctic Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico and nearly everywhere in between. Because these pipelines carry volatile, flammable, or toxic materials, they have the potential to injure the public, destroy pr operty, and damage the environment. Although they are generally an efficient and comparatively safe means of transport, pipeline systems are nonetheless vulnerable to accidents, operational failure, and malicious attacks. A series of accidents in California, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, among other places, have demonstrated this vulnerability and have heightened congressional concern about U.S. pipeline safety. The Department of Energy's first Quadrennial Energy Review (QER), released in 2015, also highlighted pipeline safety as a growing concern for the nation's energy infrastructure. The federal pipeline safety program resides primarily within the Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), although its inspection and enforcement activities rely heavily upon partnerships with the states. Together, the federal and state pipeline safety agencies administer a comprehensive set of regulatory authorities which has changed significantly over the last decade and continues to do so. The federal pipeline safety program is authorized through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, under the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (PIPES Act; P.L. 114-183) signed by President Obama on June 22, 2016. The act contains a broad range of provisions addressing pipeline safety. Among the most significant are provisions to increase the number of federal pipeline safety inspectors, require automatic shutoff valves for transmission pipelines, mandate verification of maximum allowable operating pressure for gas transmission pipelines, increase civil penalties for pipeline safety violations, and mandate reviews of diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. Altogether, the act imposed 42 mandates on PHMSA regarding studies, rules, maps, and other elements of the federal pipeline safety program. PHMSA is authorized through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, under the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (PIPES Act; P.L. 114-183) signed by President Obama on June 22, 2016. The act authorizes the federal pipeline safety program through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Among its other provisions, the act requires PHMSA to promulgate federal safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and grants PHMSA emergency order authority to address urgent \"industry-wide safety conditions\" without prior notice. The act also requires PHMSA to report regularly on the progress of outstanding statutory mandates, which are discussed in this report. The 116th Congress may focus on several key issues in its continuing oversight of federal pipeline safety and as it considers PHMSA's reauthorization, including incomplete statutory mandates, adequacy of PHMSA staffing, state program oversight, aging pipeline infrastructure, and PHMSA's role in pipeline security.

It addressed congressional concerns about violent crime, and violence against women in particular, in several ways. Among other things, it allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders; mandated restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses; and authorized grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. VAWA programs generally address domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, although some VAWA programs address additional crimes. VAWA grant programs largely address the criminal justice system and community response to these crimes, but certain programs address prevention as well. These crimes involve a wide range of victim demographics, but the risk of victimization is highest for women. The fundamental goals of VAWA are to prevent violent crime; respond to the needs of crime victims; learn more about crime; and change public attitudes through a collaborative effort by the criminal justice system, social service agencies, research organizations, schools, public health organizations, and private organizations. The federal government tries to achieve these goals primarily through federal grant programs that provide funding to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments; nonprofit organizations; and universities. Since its creation through FY2018, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) has awarded more than $8 billion in grants and cooperative agreements to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments; nonprofit organizations; and universities. While OVW administers the majority of VAWA-authorized grants, other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), also manage VAWA programs.

For a history of DOL regulations on the EAP exemptions, see CRS Report R45007, Overtime Exemptions in the Fair Labor Standards Act for Executive, Administrative, and Professional Employees, by David H. Bradley. For a broader overview of the FLSA, see CRS Report R42713, The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA): An Overview. This report proceeds in three sections. First, there is an overview of the main federal statute on overtime pay\u2014the FLSA\u2014and of defining and delimiting the EAP exemptions. Second, there is a discussion of the applicability of the EAP exemptions. Finally, there is information on the EAP exemptions in the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule (which was finalized but invalidated before it took effect). The application of the FLSA is determined by the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA, P.L. 104-1), which was enacted in 1995 and extends some FLSA provisions, including overtime provisions, and other labor and workplace laws to congressional employees. Rulemaking on the EAP exemptions would apply to congressional staff if the Board adopts them and Congress approves the Board's regulations, pursuant to the process established in the CAA. In other words, regulations adopted by the Board do not have legal effect until they are approved by Congress. When the Secretary of Labor issued new regulations to update the EAP exemptions in 2004, the Board adopted them; but thus far, Congress has apparently not approved the 2004 overtime regulations. Thus, overtime regulations that were adopted by the Board and approved by Congress in 1996, based on DOL regulations originally promulgated in 1975, currently apply to congressional staff. In the absence of action by the Board and by Congress, the provisions in any future final rules would not change the status quo. On March 22, 2019, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the Federal Register to define and delimit EAP exemptions. The proposed rule would not only revise the regulations on the EAP exemptions but would also formally rescind the 2016 final rule. Such a rescission would provide that if any or all of the substantive provisions of the 2019 rule were invalidated or not put into effect, the EAP regulations would revert to those promulgated in the 2004 final rule. Due to the invalidation of the 2016 final rule, DOL currently enforces the provisions of the 2004 final rule.",

The UAE's leadership has been put into doubt by Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid al-Nuhayyan, who was elected president of the UAE in 2004. The UAE's eldest son, Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid al-Nuhayyan, born in 1948, was elevated from Crown Prince to ruler of Abu Dhabi upon Zayid's death.

In 2013, a \"new look\" cabinet included several young figures. Cabinet reshuffles in February 2016 and October 2017 added more young ministers, many of them female, and established minister of state positions for \"tolerance,\" \"happiness,\" artificial intelligence, and food security. Other reforms included formation of an Emirates Foundation for Schools, run by an independent board of directors; limiting the mandate of the Ministry of Health to a focus on disease prevention; and creating a science council with a mandate to promote a new generation of Emirati scientists.

One of USFA's key objectives is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. The United States Fire Administration (USFA) receives its annual appropriation through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed $42.3 million for USFA, a 3.8% decrease from the FY2016 level. The request included $1.5 million for facilities improvement under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. The budget proposal included $500,000 for distance learning capability and reductions of $1 million each for National Fire Incident Reporting System and state fire training grants. The budget request would also transfer the stand-alone USFA budget account into the Preparedness and Protection activity under FEMA's broader Federal Assistance account. On May 26, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3001, the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2017. The Senate bill would provide $44 million for USFA, which matches the FY2016 level and is $1.688 million above the request. In the accompanying report (S.Rept. 114-68), the committee stated that the increase over the Administration request should allow for the continued development of the National Fire Incident Reporting System and support for the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. The committee maintained a separate budget account for USFA and did not transfer the USFA budget account to the Federal Assistance account as proposed in the Administration budget request.

    "crs_R44981": "The 116th Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, faces numerous trade policy issues related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations and the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). On May 18, 2017, the Trump Administration sent a 90-day notification to Congress of its intent to begin talks with Canada and Mexico to renegotiate and modernize NAFTA, as required by the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Talks officially began on August 16, 2017. On September 30, 2018, leaders from the United States, Canada, and Mexico announced the conclusion of the negotiations for a modernized NAFTA, which would now be called the USMCA. On November 30, 2018, the proposed USMCA was signed by President Donald J. Trump, then President Enrique Pea Nieto of Mexico, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. President Trump stated his intention to withdraw from or renegotiate NAFTA during his election campaign and has hinted at the possibility of NAFTA withdrawal since he entered into office. Key issues for Congress in regard to the consideration of the proposed USMCA include the constitutional authority of Congress over international trade, its role in revising, approving, or withdrawing from the agreement, U.S. negotiating objectives and the extent to which the proposed agreement makes progress in meeting them as required under TPA. Congress may also consider the agreement's impact on U.S. industries, the U.S. economy, and broader U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico, two of the United States' largest trading partners. The proposed USMCA, if approved by Congress, would revise some key provisions such as auto rules of origin, which, some argue roll back longstanding U.S. FTA provisions. On the other hand, it establishes new updated provisions in areas such as digital trade and intellectual property rights. A key question for Congress may be whether the agreement strikes the right balance overall. After numerous rounds of negotiations, on August 31, 2018, after the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary U.S.-Mexico agreement, President Trump notified Congress of his intention to \"enter into a trade agreement with Mexico \u2013 and with Canada if it is willing.\" On September 30, 2018, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer announced that the three countries had reached an agreement on a USMCA trade deal that would revise, modernize, and replace NAFTA upon ratification. Canada, in its negotiating objectives, pledged to make NAFTA more \"progressive\" by strengthening labor and environmental provisions, adding a new chapter on indigenous rights, reforming the investor-state dispute settlement process, and protecting Canada's supply-management system for dairy and poultry, among other objectives. Mexico's set of negotiating objectives prioritized free trade of goods and services, and included provisions to update NAFTA, such as working toward \"inclusive and responsible\" trade by incorporating cooperation mechanisms in areas related to labor standards, anticorruption, and the environment, as well as strengthening energy security by enhancing NAFTA's chapter on energy. While the USTR's NAFTA negotiating objectives included many goals consistent with TPA, USTR also sought, for the first time in U.S. trade negotiations, to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with NAFTA countries, among other specific objectives. U.S. objectives appeared to seek to \"rebalance the benefits\" of the agreement, echoing President Trump's statements that NAFTA has been a \"disaster\" and the \"worst agreement ever negotiated.\" Some U.S. negotiating positions could be seen to have the explicit or implicit goal of promoting U.S. economic sovereignty and/or rolling back previous liberalization commitments in specific areas, such as reviewing and potentially sunsetting the agreement every five years, questioning the validity of binational dispute settlement, enhancing government procurement restrictions, and increasing U.S. and North American content in the auto rules of origin. Trump Administration officials also spoke of unraveling the North American and global supply chains as a way of attempting to divert trade and investment from Canada and Mexico to the United States. Some proponents and critics of NAFTA agree that NAFTA should be modernized, but have contrasting views on how to revise the agreement. This report provides a brief overview of NAFTA and the role of Congress in the renegotiation process, and discusses key provisions in the proposed USMCA, as well as issues related to the negotiations. It also provides a discussion of policy implications for Congress going forward. It will not examine existing NAFTA provisions",

    "crs_R45656": "Congress has long deliberated on drinking water quality and infrastructure, which have been brought to the forefront of national attention by several events. Such events include the detection of elevated lead levels in tap water in Flint, MI, and other cities; hurricanes and other natural disasters that damaged or destroyed community drinking water infrastructure; and local source water contamination events (e.g., chemical spills and algal blooms). Representatives of state drinking water agencies, private sector engineers, and others report that much of the nation's drinking water infrastructure is deteriorating, threatening public health, and increasing operations and maintenance costs. In 2012, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) reported that much of the drinking water infrastructure (more than 1 million miles of buried pipe) was constructed in the 19th and 20th centuries and is nearing the end of its useful life. While disagreement exists over the scope and costs of improvement and replacements, estimates of the funding needs are substantial. In March 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its sixth Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment. In this survey, EPA estimated that public water systems would need to invest $472.60 billion for drinking water capital improvements over the next 20 years to achieve compliance and ensure the provision of safe drinking water. Although all projects identified in the needs survey would promote health objectives, EPA reported that 12% of the 20-year estimated need was directly attributed to statutory compliance. The majority (88%) of needs are for ongoing investments, such as repair of aging drinking water infrastructure. In 2012, AWWA conducted a broader drinking water infrastructure survey that reported that the costs to replace aging drinking water infrastructure and expand water service to growing populations will increase to more than $1 trillion over the next 25 years. Communities nationwide may face financial challenges as they manage the need to repair or replace aging drinking water infrastructure. Congress deliberated on several of these drinking water infrastructure issues while developing America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270), enacted on October 23, 2018. Title I of the act, \"The Water Resource Development Act of 2018,\" authorizes a wide variety of water resource and infrastructure policies, programs, and projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Water Resource Development Act bills are often considered on a biennial schedule and have primarily addressed USACE projects. Title III of AWIA primarily addresses hydropower activities of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Title II and IV of the act include provisions that address EPA water infrastructure programs and other authorities. This report analyzes the drinking water provisions of Title II and IV rather than providing a comprehensive summary of AWIA. Title II constitutes the most comprehensive reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) since 1996. It amends SDWA to promote compliance with SDWA requirements, reauthorize appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, expand program eligibilities, increase emphasis on assisting disadvantaged communities, make SDWA compliance more affordable, and improve consumer confidence in public water supplies. Title II also authorizes new grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water, assist small and disadvantaged communities, and develop public water system resilience, among other purposes. Title IV addresses several other water quality and infrastructure issues by authorizing and revising activities and programs for EPA, the Bureau of Reclamation within the Department of the Interior, and other federal agencies. Specifically, these provisions authorize a water efficiency program and activities and revise the Water Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, which provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects. Title IV also includes several amendments to the Clean Water Act to address stormwater by expanding a municipal sewer overflow grant programs to include stormwater management projects, reauthorizing appropriations for said municipal sewer overflow grant program, and directing EPA to establish a task force for stormwater management.",

In 2002, the agency began investigating allegations that Iran had conducted clandestine nuclear activities; the IAEA ultimately reported that some of these activities had violated Tehran's safeguards agreement. Following more than three years of investigation, the IAEA Board of Governors referred the matter to the U.N. Security Council in February 2006.

The MSPB also aims to promote an effective federal workforce free of prohibited personnel practices. The MSPB mainly carries out its mission through adjudication of federal employee appeals of adverse actions. When the Board determines that a federal employee has been subject to an improper adverse action, it may order relief, including reins tatement, backpay, and attorney's fees. The Board may also order federal agencies to comply with Board orders, conduct special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems, and review Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rules and regulations to determine, for example, whether a federal agency has invalidly implemented the OPM requirements. This report focuses on the Board's adjudicatory authority. Federal law specifies that the Board consists of three members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, as of March 2019, the Board lacks any sitting members. Although other MSPB employees, including administrative judges who issue initial decisions in cases, will continue their work, some Members of Congress and others have raised concerns about the extent to which these vacancies limit the agency's ability to perform its other functions. This report discusses the establishment of the MSPB and its structure, as well as the role of the Office of Special Counsel, an independent, prosecutorial agency that operates concurrently with the Board.

    "crs_R45689": "This report provides both an overview of the FY2019 defense appropriations act (P.L. 115-245) and access to other CRS products providing additional detail and analysis on particular issues and programs dealt with by that law. The Trump Administration requested $668.4 billion to fund programs falling within the scope of the annual defense appropriations act. This included $67.9 billion to be designated by Congress and the President as funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and $599.4 billion for DOD's base budget, comprising all operations not designated as OCO. OCO-designated funding is related to current operations in Afghanistan and Syria, but includes other activities that Congress and the President so-designate. As enacted, H.R. 6157 provides $667.3 billion, a net reduction of $1.09 billion amounting to less than two-tenths of 1% of the total (i.e., base budget plus OCO) request. Compared with the total amount provided by the FY2018 defense appropriations bill (P.L. 114-113), the FY2019 act provides an increase of 2.3%. The House initially passed H.R. 6197 on June 28, 2018, by a vote of 359-49. On that same day, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3159, its own version of the FY2019 Defense Appropriations bill. Subsequently, the Senate adopted several amendments to H.R. 6157, including one that substituted the text of the Senate committee bill for the House-passed text. The Senate also adopted an amendment that added to the defense bill the text of S. 3158, the FY2019 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which the Senate Appropriations Committee had approved on August 20, 2018. The Senate then passed H.R. 6197, as amended, on August 23, 2018, by a vote of 85-7. A House-Senate conference committee reported a version of the bill on September 13, 2018. The Senate approved the conference report on September 18 by a vote of 93-7 and the House did likewise on September 26 by a vote of 361-61. President Donald J. Trump signed the bill into law (P.L. 115-245) on September 28, 2018. The total amount requested for DOD that falls within the scope of the annual defense appropriations bill and amounts provided in P.L. 115-245 as enacted are relatively close. Within those gross totals, however, there are differences between the amounts requested and the amounts provided for hundreds of specific elements within the sprawling DOD budget. Many of these individual differences reflect congressional judgements about particular issues. However, there also are patterns of differences that reflect congressional views on broad policy or budgetary questions: Title I of the act, that funds Military Personnel accounts, provides $2.2 billion less than was requested for pay and benefits. House-Senate conferees said the reduction should have no adverse impact on the force. According to the conference report, revised estimates of the budgetary impact of recent changes in the military retirement system were the basis for a net reduction from the request of $1.54 billion. Other reductions totaling $430 million were justified by conferees on the basis of \"historical unobligated balances,\" that is, an accumulation of funds in certain accounts that were appropriated in prior years but were not spent. Base budget funding provided by the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) title of the act (Title II) amounts to a net reduction of $5.2 billion from the request. In part, the apparent cut reflects a transfer of nearly $2.0 billion to Title IX of the act, which funds OCO. The conferees justified additional reductions totaling $1.34 billion on the basis of either large unobligated balances or \"historical underexecution,\" (i.e., a pattern of repeatedly spending less on military personnel in a given fiscal year than had been appropriated). On the other hand, total procurement funding for the base budget (Title III) is $4.8 billion higher than the request. While the act makes hundreds of additions and cuts to the funding requested for particular items, three broad themes all push the act's procurement total upward: $2.48 billion is added to buy aircraft and other equipment for National Guard and reserve forces; $2.31 billion is added to fully fund or acquire major components for additional six ships; and $2.13 billion is added to the $8.49 billion requested for procurement of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.

    "crs_R42723": "The Marines have been developing the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport Marines when ashore. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. Because of a perceived amphibious \"redundancy,\" some have questioned the need for both the ACV and MPC. In June 2013, citing budgetary pressures, the Marines reportedly put the MPC program \"on ice\" and suggested that it might not be resurrected for about 10 years. Although some have questioned why the Marines cannot simply \"adopt\" a U.S. Army personnel carrier, Marine requirements for a personnel carrier reflect the need for this vehicle to be compatible with amphibious assault craft, as well as to have an enhanced amphibious capability, which is not necessarily an Army requirement. With the Marines involved in decades-long land conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and proliferating anti-access technologies such as guided missiles, some analysts questioned whether the Marines would ever again be called on to conduct a large-scale amphibious assault operation. In response to these questions and the perceived need to examine the post-Iraq and Afghanistan Marine Corps, the Department of the Navy and DOD studied the requirement to conduct large-scale amphibious operations and in early 2012 released a strategic vision for how amphibious operations will be conducted in the future. The primary assertion of this study is that the Marines' and Navy's amphibious capabilities serve a central role in the defense of the global interests of a maritime nation. The need to maintain an amphibious assault capability is viewed by Marine Corps leadership as establishing the requirement for the ACV and MPC. In March 2014, the Marines decided in March 2014 to \"resurrect\" the MPC and designate it as ACV Increment 1.1 and initially acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV Increment 1.2, a tracked version, and to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. Although ACV Increment 1.1 will have a swim capability, a connector will be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore. Plans called for ACV Increment 1.1 to enter the acquisition cycle at Milestone B (Engineering and Manufacturing Development) in FY2016, award prototype contracts leading to a down select to one vendor in FY2018, and enter low-rate initial production. On November 24, 2015, the Marine Corps awarded BAE Systems and Scientific Applications International Corporation contracts to develop ACV 1.1 prototypes for evaluation. BAE's contract was for $103.8 million and SAIC's for $121.5 million, and each company is to build 16 prototypes. The Marines expect to down select to a single vendor in 2018. Initial operational capability (IOC) was expected by the end of 2020, and all ACV 1.1 vehicles are planned to be fielded by summer 2023. Plans are to equip six battalions with ACV 1.1s and 392 existing upgraded AAVs. Both BAE and SAIC reportedly have a long history related to amphibious vehicles, as BAE built the Marines' original AAV and SAIC has built hundreds of Terrex 1 vehicles used by Singapore, and both companies had Marine Corps contracts to modernize AAVs. ACV 1.1 is intended to have some amphibious capability but would rely on ship-to-shore connectors.

Prior to FY2008, however, Congress provided funds for the Department of State and international broadcasting within the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations (CJS) and separately provided foreign aid funds within Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs appropriations. The transition between the different alignments occurred in the 109th Congress, with a change in appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction. For that Congress, the House of Representatives appropriated State Department funds separately from foreign aid, as in earlier Congresses, but the Senate differed by appropriating State and foreign aid funds within one bill\u2014the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations. Both the House and Senate began jointly funding Department of State and foreign aid appropriations within the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161). SFOPS appropriations currently include State Department Operations (including accounts for Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance, and Education and Cultural Affairs, among others); Foreign Operations (including USAID administration expenses, bilateral economic assistance, international security assistance, multilateral assistance, and export assistance); various international commissions; and International Broadcasting (including VOA, RFE/RL, Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks).

    "crs_R44601": "The House of Representatives and the Senate operate a restaurant system that serves Members of Congress, congressional employees, constituents, and other visitors to the Capitol, House office buildings, and Senate office buildings. The House and Senate restaurant systems have existed since the early 1800s and have grown and modernized over time. Although many of their services may seem similar, food operations are separately administered and managed for the House, for the Senate, and for the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). By meeting congressional dining needs during workdays that frequently can be unpredictable, the restaurant systems help facilitate the legislative and representational work of Congress. Because many Members and staff visit these restaurants every day, they remain a subject of ongoing congressional interest. Since 1994, the House restaurants have been operated by a private vendor, with oversight provided by the House. Under the Rules of the House of Representatives, the House restaurants fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration, which delegates much of the daily oversight and financial management of the restaurant system to the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the House. On June 9, 2015, the CAO announced that Sodexo Government Services would be the new food service provider for the House. The contract with Sodexo is for an initial term of four years. Starting in 2019, six two-year options may extend the contract for up to 12 additional years. The CAO encouraged ideas from vendors to improve operations in the Members' dining room and also initiated service schedule changes. Food service providers would not be required to operate the Members' dining room when late votes were scheduled in the evenings, on weekends, or on holidays, and instead the room would be available for hosting catered events. To aid in the service transition, once Sodexo was chosen as the new vendor, it designated a community relations officer, a position unique to its House operation, to help address comments and resolve problems raised by House dining patrons. It is not publicly known whether or not the past provider, Restaurant Associates, submitted a bid to renew its contract. Sodexo assumed its responsibilities as the House vendor on August 7, 2015, and immediately began renovations and other changes related to the transition, some of which continued in 2016. The CAO announced several major changes to House dining operations, including the following: For lunch and dinner, the Members' dining room would replace a la carte service with a buffet. The introduction of an online system that allows users to preorder their food items and pick them up in the Longworth Cafeteria. The replacement of some eateries with popular branded restaurant concepts. Beginning in September 2018, the Members' dining room also began providing service to congressional employees. The House and Senate restaurants are operated by private food service contractors who handle most of the day-to-day concerns. Despite this delegation, the House and Senate remain responsible for food service oversight. This shared administration resulted from how the congressional restaurant systems developed and grew over time. As a result, many of the issues faced by the House and Senate restaurants today are addressed by the contractors themselves. Other issues are addressed by the House Administration Committee, Senate Rules and Administration Committee, or other congressional support offices. Together, these entities strive to meet the needs of the Members and staff who rely upon congressional dining services to help them carry out their daily legislative and representational work.",
    "crs_RS22389": "The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) to provide an incentive for the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. These federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects via a competitive application process administered by state housing finance authorities (HFAs). Developers either use the credits or sell them to investors to raise capital for real estate projects, which, in turn, reduces the debt or equity contribution that would otherwise be required of developers. With lower financing costs, tax credit properties can potentially expand the supply of affordable rental housing. The LIHTC is estimated to cost the government an average of $9.9 billion annually. The process of allocating, awarding, and then claiming the LIHTC is complex and lengthy. The process begins at the federal level with each state receiving an annual LIHTC allocation in accordance with federal law. State housing agencies then allocate credits to developers of rental housing according to federally required, but state created, allocation plans. The process typically ends with developers selling allocated credits to outside investors in exchange for equity. The tax credits cannot be claimed until the real estate development is complete and operable. This means that more than a year or two could pass between the time of the tax credit allocation and the time the credit is claimed. If, for example, a project were completed in July of 2018, depending on the filing period of the investor, the tax credits may not begin to be claimed until sometime in 2019. Trading tax credits, or selling them, refers to the process of exchanging tax credits for equity investment in real estate projects. Developers recruit investors to provide equity to fund development projects and offer the tax credits to those investors in exchange for their commitment. When credits are sold, the sale is usually structured with a limited partnership between the developer and the investor, and sometimes administered by syndicators who must adhere to the complex provisions of the tax code. As the general partner, the developer has a very small ownership percentage but maintains the authority to build and run the project on a day-to-day basis. The investor, as a limited partner, has a large ownership percentage with an otherwise passive role. Syndicators charge a fee for overseeing the investment transactions. Typically, investors do not expect their equity investment in a project to produce income. Instead, investors look to the credits, which will be used to offset their income tax liabilities, as their return on investment. The return investors receive is determined in part by the market price of the tax credits. The larger the difference between the market price of the credits and their face value ($1.00), the larger the return to investors. The investor can also receive tax benefits related to any tax losses generated through the project's operating costs, interest on its debt, and deductions such as depreciation.",

The other two, 18 U.S.C.  3553(e) and Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, afford a sentencing court comparable latitude but only on the motion of the prosecutor, based on the defendant's substantial assistance to the government, and without regard to the offense charged. The safety valve is available to qualified offenders convicted of violations of the drug trafficking, simple possession, attempt, or conspiracy provisions of the Controlled Substances or Controlled Substances Import and Export acts. It is not available to avoid the mandatory minimum sentences that attend some of the other controlled substance offenses, even those closely related to the covered offenses. The First Step Act authorized safety-valve relief for convictions under the Maritime Drug Enforcement Act and for defendants with slightly more extensive prior criminal records. The safety valve is available to qualified offenders convicted of violations of the drug trafficking, simple possession, attempt, or conspiracy provisions of the Controlled Substances or Controlled Substances Import and Export acts. It is not available to avoid the mandatory minimum sentences that attend some of the other controlled substance offenses, even those closely related to the covered offenses. The prosecution need not prove that a defendant is ineligible for safety valve relief. The Supreme Court did hold in Alleyne v. United States that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an 'element' [of the offense] that must be submitted to the jury's and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Subsequent lower appellate courts, however, have held that Alleyne does not require a jury verdict or application of the reasonable doubt standard. Thus, for the convictions to which the safety valve applies, the defendant must convince the sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence that he satisfies each of the safety valve's five requirements. He may not have a disqualifying criminal history point total. He may not have used violence or a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. He may not have been an organizer or leader of the drug enterprise. He must have provided the government with all the information and evidence at his disposal. Finally, the offense may not have resulted in serious injury or death. Three provisions authorize federal courts to reduce a defendant's sentence on the motion of the government for substantial assistance: Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.  3553(e), and Section 5K1.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Only Section 3553(e) and Rule 35(b) are limited to mandatory minimums established for controlled substance offenses. Unlike the safety valve, neither Section 3553(e) nor Rule 35(b) is limited to mandatory minimums established for controlled substance offenses.

    "crs_RS22640": "The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with the People's Republic of China (China) remains a major source of bilateral tension. Some Members of Congress and other U.S. government officials often point to the bilateral trade imbalance as evidence that China is not competing fairly in the global market. In March 2018, the Trump Administration reportedly asked China to develop a plan to reduce the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion. On March 31, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13786, which states: Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consultation with the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, and the heads of any other executive departments or agencies with relevant expertise, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR, shall prepare and submit to the President an Omnibus Report on Significant Trade Deficits (Report). President Trump also issued Executive Order 13796, \"Addressing Trade Agreement Violations and Abuses,\" on April 29, 2017, which, among other things, requires the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR to \"conduct comprehensive performance reviews\" of \"all trade relations with countries governed by the rules of the World Trade Organization with which the United States does not have free trade agreements but with which the United States runs significant trade deficits in goods.\" China is one such country. Despite the priority the Trump Administration has placed on reducing bilateral trade deficits in general, and with China in particular, according to official U.S. trade statistics, the overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit and the bilateral deficit with China increased in 2017 and 2018. The overall deficit rose from $736.6 billion in 2016 to $795.7 billion in 2017, and $878.7 billion in 2018. The bilateral deficit with China accounted for 47.1%, 47.2%, and 47.7% of the total merchandise trade deficit for the last three years, respectively. Debate over this trade deficit is hampered by disagreement between the two countries on how large the deficit actually is. According to official U.S. figures, China has surpassed Canada as the largest supplier of U.S. imports, running up a bilateral merchandise trade surplus in 2018 of $419.2 billion. However, according to official Chinese figures, China's trade surplus with the United States in 2018 was $323.9 billion\u2014$95.9 billion less than the U.S. figure. The U.S. trade deficit with China plays a role, directly and indirectly, in proposed legislation addressing bilateral trade relations. The Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act (H.R. 704 and S. 2), for example, refers to \"a severely imbalanced trading relationship\" with China, and would impose restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States \"due to its negative effect on the United States trade deficit and wages of workers in the United States.\" The United States Reciprocal Trade Act (H.R. 764) finds, \"The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and nontariff barriers contributes to the large and growing United States trade deficit in goods, which is a drag on economic growth and undermines economic prosperity.\" The act would authorize the President to negotiate an agreement with a country that has higher tariff or nontariff barriers than the United States, or impose additional duties on that country's exports to the United States. The main explanations for the discrepancies between the official U.S. and Chinese trade statistics are that the two nations use different statistical methods to calculate the trade data. The main explanations are that the United States uses the \"free on board\" (F.O.B.) terms for exports and the \"cost, insurance, and freight\" (C.I.F.) terms for imports. The United States uses the \"free alongside\" (F.A.S.) terms and values imports using a customs definition. As a result, official U.S. trade data place a lower value on both U.S. exports to China and imports from China than the official Chinese data. In addition, direct comparisons of the official U.S. and Chinese trade balances reported in the media are potentially misleading, because the goods trades are being evaluated using different methods. For more accurate direct comparisons, the trade data for both nations should be evaluated using the same terms.

    "crs_R43389": "The U.S. Treasury has the authority to manage the structure of federal debt. The statutory debt limit applies to almost all federal debt. The limit applies to federal debt held by the public (that is, debt held outside the federal government itself) and to federal debt held by the government's own accounts. Federal trust funds, such as Social Security, Medicare, Transportation, and Civil Service Retirement accounts, hold most of this internally held debt. Federal debt subject to limit is set at $21.988 trillion, a level that accommodates federal obligations incurred during the suspension period. On March 4, 2019, the first business day after the debt limit suspension had lapsed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invoked extraordinary authorities. Those extraordinary measures, along with cash balances and incoming revenues, can be used to meet federal obligations in coming months. In anticipation of the lapse of the debt limit suspension, the U.S. Treasury had announced it would stop issuing state and local government securities (SLGs) on March 1, 2019. SLGs are used by state and local governments as one way of complying with IRS anti-arbitrage rules. Issuance of SLGs is expected to resume once the current debt limit episode is resolved. The amount of time that extraordinary measures allow the U.S. Treasury to extend its borrowing capacity depends on the pace of deficit spending, the timing of cash receipts and outlays, and other technical factors. Tax deadlines and processing dates for some federal disbursements are scheduled, but amounts of collections and outlays depend on decisions and actions of private entities and other federal agencies, which are more difficult to predict. The effects of recent tax changes (P.L. 115-97) and the possibility that further changes could occur in the 116th Congress could also affect revenue projections. Treasury cash flow projections are therefore subject to uncertainty, which complicates attempts to estimate how long extraordinary measures would enable the federal government to meet its financial obligations. Estimates calculated by others of when Treasury would reach the debt limit and how long extraordinary measures would extend federal borrowing capacity have typically been close to Treasury's estimates. The U.S. Treasury Inspector General reported in 2012 that \"the margin of error in these estimates at a 98 percent confidence level is plus or minus $18 billion for one week into the future and plus or minus $30 billion for two weeks into the future.\" An impending debt ceiling constraint presents more than one deadline. A first deadline is the exhaustion of borrowing capacity. The U.S. Treasury, however, could continue to meet obligations using available cash balances. As cash balances run down, however, other complications could emerge and Treasury's cash resources could fall below levels deemed prudent by outside advisors well before extraordinary measures were exhausted. Low cash balances could complicate federal debt management and Treasury auctions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has also noted that debt limit episodes generate severe strains for Treasury staff, especially when its room for maneuver is severely restricted. Finally, if the U.S. Treasury were to run out of cash, the Treasury Secretary would face difficult choices in how to comply simultaneously with the debt limit and the mandate to pay federal obligations in a timely fashion. The debt limit was reestablished on March 2, 2019, at $21.988 trillion, a level that accommodates federal obligations during the suspension period. On March 4, 2019, the first business day after the debt limit suspension had lapsed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invoked extraordinary authorities. Those extraordinary measures, along with cash balances and incoming revenues, can be used to meet federal obligations in coming months. In late 2017 and early 2018 the debt limit issue was tied to consideration of funding measures for FY2018. On September 8, 2017, enactment of a continuing resolution (Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017; P.L. 115-56) suspended the debt limit through December 8, 2018. Once that suspension lapsed, extraordinary measures were used to meet federal obligations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123), enacted on February 9, 2018, included a provision (Section 30301) that suspended the debt limit through March 1, 2019. A section near the end of this report summarizes recent debt limit activity in more detail. In January 2019, the House adopted Rule XXVIII that when the House approves a budget resolution, a measure to suspend the debt limit for the remainder of the fiscal year would be automatically engrossed and transmitted to the Senate.",
    "crs_R44801": "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5721 et seq.) authorizes the President to issue two types of declarations that could potentially provide federal assistance to states and localities in response to a terrorist attack: a \"major disaster declaration\" or an \"emergency declaration.\" Major disaster declarations authorize a wide-range of federal assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals and households, and certain nonprofit organizations to aid recovery from a catastrophic event. Major disaster declarations must be requested by the state governor or tribal leader. Emergency declarations authorize a more limited range of federal assistance and are issued by the President to protect property and public health and safety and to lessen or avert the threat of a major disaster. In most cases, the state governor or tribal leader must request an emergency declaration; however, under 501(b) of the Stafford Act, the President has authority to issue an emergency declaration without a gubernatorial or tribal request under specified conditions. Examples of these types of emergency declarations with respect to terrorist incidents include the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, and the September 11, 2001, attack on the Pentagon. In each instance, the emergency declaration was followed by a major disaster declaration. While the Stafford Act has been used to provide assistance in response to terrorist attacks in the past, recent incidents such as the mass shootings that occurred in 2015 and 2016 in San Bernardino, CA, and Orlando, FL, respectively, and the 2016 vehicular attacks in Nice, France, and Ohio State University may have brought to light some potential shortcomings in the Stafford Act. That is, certain terror attacks may not meet the criteria of a major disaster for two reasons. First, depending on the mechanism used in the attack, certain terror incidents may not meet the legal definition of a major disaster. Of interest here, the Stafford Act defines a major disaster as \"any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance.\" The list of incidents that qualify for a major disaster declaration is specifically limited, and it is not clear if a terror attack would meet the legal definition of a major disaster if the incident involved something other than a fire or explosion. Meeting the definition of a major disaster is a necessary but insufficient condition for the receipt of major disaster assistance. The incident's cost must also be beyond the capacity of the state and local government. When an incident occurs, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) meets with the state to assess damage costs to affected homes and public infrastructure. Damages to public infrastructure are particularly important because this amount is compared to the state's population. This comparison is called the \"per capita threshold.\" FEMA uses the threshold to assess state and local government capacity. In general, FEMA will recommend that the President declare a major disaster if the incident meets or exceeds the per capita threshold. It is conceivable that a terrorist incident could cause substantial loss of life but cause little or no damage to homes and public infrastructure. This lack of damage (to public infrastructure) may disqualify these incidents from receiving the wider range of assistance provided under a major disaster declaration. With respect to terrorism, some may view the Stafford Act's current framework adequate and oppose efforts to alter it. Their reasons are twofold. First, while terrorist incidents such as mass shootings can be devastating in terms of loss of life and impact on national morale, some argue that a major disaster should not be declared for terrorist incidents that do not cause enough damage to public infrastructure to warrant federal assistance. State and local governments, as well as insurance coverage, they say, should be the main sources of assistance if damages are limited. Second, they may argue that terror incidents that do not meet the criteria of a major disaster could be eligible for Stafford Act assistance under an emergency declaration. In contrast to the prescribed definition of incidents that qualify as a major disaster, an emergency is defined more broadly to include \"any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States.\" The Stafford Act defines an emergency as any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, federal assistance is needed",
    "crs_R43813": "Colombia, one of the oldest democracies in the Western Hemisphere and the third most populous Latin American country, has endured a multisided civil conflict for more than five decades until President Juan Ma nuel Santos declared the conflict over in August 2017 at the end of a U.N.-monitored disarmament. According to the National Center for Historical Memory 2013 report, presented to the Colombian government as part of the peace process to end the fighting, some 220,000 Colombians died in the armed conflict through 2012, 81% of them civilians. The report also provided statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, which has taken a huge toll on Colombian society: more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012; internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence; 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010; and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). To date, more than 8 million Colombians, or roughly 15% of the population, have registered as conflict victims. Although the violence has scarred Colombia, the country has achieved a significant turnaround. Once considered a likely candidate to become a failed state, Colombia, over the past two decades, has overcome much of the violence that had clouded its future. For example, between 2000 and 2016, Colombia saw a 94% decrease in kidnappings and a 53% reduction in homicides (below 25 per 100,000 in 2016). Coupled with success in lowering violence, Colombia has opened its economy and promoted trade, investment, and growth. Colombia has become one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. Yet, after steady growth over several years, Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017. Many analysts identified Colombia's dependence on oil and other commodity exports as the primary cause. Between 2012 and 2016, the Colombian government held formal peace talks with the FARC, Colombia's largest guerrilla organization. Upon taking office for a second term in August 2014, President Santos declared peace, equality, and education as his top priorities, although achieving the peace accord remained his major focus. In August 2016, the government and FARC negotiators announced they had concluded their talks and achieved a 300-page peace accord.

    "crs_R40760": "Since the first session of Congress in 1789, the House of Representatives and the Senate have contemplated how to judge fellow Members. Investigating and judging Members of Congress continues to be an issue for Congress. In 1964, the Senate established the Select Committee on Ethics, and in 1967, the House created the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which was renamed the Committee on Ethics in the 112th Congress (2011-2012). These two committees formally assumed the duties of investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Members of their respective chambers. In the House, the Committee on Ethics has had sole responsibility to investigate and recommend the discipline of Members. Self-discipline by the Committee on Ethics has, at various times, been considered problematic, as Members are dependent on one another to do their jobs, bring individual perspectives on chamber rules to investigations, and are judged by the public at the same time they are judging congressional colleagues. This creates a difficult investigative environment and often leads to closed-door investigations and media allegations of improper enforcement of chamber rules. Historically, Congress has used its ethics power neither arbitrarily nor frequently. Congress has, however, \"periodically tightened its ethics codes and procedures for dealing with misconduct.\" In addition to amending internal congressional ethics codes and procedures, Congress has considered numerous legislative proposals since 1951 to create an independent ethics advisory body that would replace or assist the Committee on Ethics with investigations or enforcement. In the 110th Congress (2007-2008), the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) to review complaints, and when appropriate, refer findings of fact to the Committee on Ethics. The OCE is intended to perform an important public service for the House and the public by assuring the integrity of the chamber. It provides a way for groups and individuals to provide information about alleged misconduct by Members, officers, and employees of the House to an investigative body. The office is designed to \"supplement but not supplant\" the role of the House Committee on Ethics.

The Coast Guard's medium polar icebreaker, Healy, spends most of its operational time in the Arctic supporting NSF research activities and performing other operations. Although polar ice is diminishing due to climate change, observers generally expect that this development will not eliminate the need for U.S. polar icebreakers, and in some respects might increase mission demands for them.

    "crs_R45482": "Exposure to ozone (often referred to as \"smog\"), regardless of where that ozone originates, has been linked to negative human health effects, including respiratory ailments and premature death. Children, the elderly, and persons with respiratory illnesses are particularly susceptible to adverse health impacts from ozone exposure. EPA estimates that ozone exposure was responsible for more than 15,000 premature deaths in the United States in 2007 based on 2006-2008 average ambient ozone concentrations. Ozone has also been linked to plant damage and decreases in crop yield. Concentrations of ozone at the ground level, originally considered a local issue, are increasingly recognized as a global challenge. Ozone is not emitted directly but is formed in the atmosphere from chemical reactions of nitrogen oxides (NO x) with volatile organic compounds (VOCs, a type of hydrocarbon) in the presence of sunlight. NO x and VOCs are known as \"precursor\" emissions, and their relative contributions to the formation of ozone depend on a number of factors, including weather conditions and concentrations of other pollutants. The lifetime of ozone in the atmosphere ranges from hours to weeks, providing time\u2014under the right conditions\u2014for pollution emitted in one location to affect the health and welfare of populations far downwind. While local emissions of ozone precursors are still the dominant source of ozone in many areas, state and local air quality agencies face ozone pollution arising from sources outside of their jurisdictional control (\"background ozone\"). The Clean Air Act (CAA) directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health (primary standards) and welfare (secondary standards). The law directs that \"the attainment and maintenance of [primary standards] are requisite to protect the public health.\" While the standards are set to limit adverse impacts, EPA acknowledges that these standards do not suggest that concentrations below these levels present zero risk. The NAAQS set limits for the concentrations in ambient air of six common \"criteria\" pollutants: lead, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and ozone. There is no evidence of a safe level of ozone exposure below which no adverse health effects occur. However, uncertainty between exposure and health response increases at very low ozone concentrations\u2014that is, below 20 parts per billion (ppb). The procedure for reviewing and setting the NAAQS explicitly does not consider what sources contribute to total ozone, including background sources. In 2018, EPA announced plans to streamline the NAAQS review process and obtain Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee advice regarding background pollution and potential adverse effects from NAAQS compliance strategies. Much of the focus of ozone transport and control has historically been on upwind domestic sources. Members of Congress may have an interest in better understanding background ozone from natural and international sources, particularly as EPA reviews the 2015 ozone standard. Contributions from sources of background ozone may become important as states with nonattainment areas develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that attempt to quantify these contributions and consider ways to address them. To assist Congress in understanding these issues, this report defines background ozone, focusing on natural and international sources, and describes what is currently known about these sources. The report then goes on to discuss the limitations in the scientific community's understanding and options for deepening that understanding.",

Benefit payments and related administrative expenses are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury, which contains federal receipts not earmarked for a specific purpose. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. Starting in 2019, under current law, these tax rates are $0.50 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.25 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 2% of the sales price. This decline in the excise tax rates will likely put additional financial strain on a trust fund that already borrows from the general fund to meet obligations. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund.

Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Many Members of Congress also regularly receive constituent inquiries about the SBA's programs. This report examines appropriations for the SBA (new budget authority, minus rescissions and sequestration) over time, focusing on developments and trends since FY2000. This report also provides total available funding (which includes carryover from the prior fiscal year, carryover into the next fiscal year, account transfers, rescissions, and sequestration) and, for comparative purposes, actual and anticipated expenditures for the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. SBA appropriations, as a whole, have varied significantly from year to year since FY2000 and across all three major SBA spending categories: appropriations for disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and \"other programs,\" a spending category that includes appropriations for salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The variation in appropriations for disaster assistance since FY2000 is largely due to supplemental appropriations provided to address disaster needs arising from the impact of major hurricanes. Business loan credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows to and from the SBA over the life of the agency's loan portfolios. For guaranteed loans, the net present value of cash flows is affected by several factors, but it is primarily the difference between the cost of purchasing loans that have defaulted and the revenue generated from fees and collateral liquidation. For direct (Microloan) lending, it is primarily the cost of offering below-market interest rates to Microloan intermediaries. The variation in appropriations for SBA business loan credit subsidies since FY2000 is primarily due to the impact of changing economic conditions on the SBA's loan portfolios. During good economic times, revenue from SBA fees and collateral liquidation is typically sufficient to cover the SBA's cost of purchasing loans that have defaulted. During and immediately following economic slowdowns, however, revenue from SBA fees and collateral liquidation is typically insufficient to cover the SBA's cost of purchasing guaranteed loans that have defaulted. The shortfall occurs because the SBA's cost of purchasing guaranteed loans tends to increase when the economy slows (primarily because guaranteed loans are more likely to default during and immediately following recessions) and revenue from loan liquidation tends to be constrained during slow economic times (primarily because commercial real estate values typically fall during and immediately following recessions). As a result, additional appropriations are needed to cover these expenses, which are guaranteed by the \"full faith and credit of the United States.\" Since FY2000, the variation in appropriations for the other programs spending category is attributable primarily to congressional response to changing economic conditions. As the report will discuss, appropriations for this spending category have generally increased at a pace that exceeds inflation. In addition, Congress approved significant, temporary increases in appropriations for SBA programs in the other programs spending category in FY2009 and FY2010. It approved these temporary increases primarily as a means to enhance small businesses' access to capital, which had become constrained during and immediately following the Great Recession (December 2007 to June 2009). The SBA's appropriations for FY2000-FY2019 have exceeded the rate of inflation. This report will be updated as events warrant.",
    "crs_R45733": "The majority of Latin American and Caribbean countries are functional democracies, but institutional weaknesses and widespread public corruption in many of these countries have undermined effective governance and sparked protest and demands for greater transparency. From a U.S. perspective, widespread corruption in Latin America is a potential threat to regional security, has a symbiotic relationship with violent crime, and can be a stimulus for migration. This report examines how anti-corruption strategies in U.S. policy and legislation initially evolved from a desire to level the playing field for corporations working in the developing world. At first, U.S. corporations were regulated so they could not bribe or extort to win contracts, and then the focus expanded to helping build more effective institutions and the rule of law in developing countries to ensure more fair, predictable, and transparent systems. The report examines how corruption contributes to wasting public monies, distorting electoral outcomes, and reinforcing criminal structures. Although the fight against corruption is a global effort, this report focuses more closely on U.S. interests in fighting corruption in the region, and how U.S. policy and assistance programs have developed to address that goal. Contemporary anti-corruption efforts in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America are examined as case studies. The report closes with considerations for Congress in conducting its oversight role over U.S. funded anti-corruption efforts in the region and pursuing the policy objective of broadening the rule of law and encouraging good government.",
    "crs_R44027": "The U.S. government's publicly available website, USAspending.gov, enables congressional staff and the public to search back to FY2008 for federal grants, contracts, loans, and other financial assistance. The website enables searching of federal awards from FY2008 to the present by state, congressional district (CD), county, and zip code. Grant awards include money the federal government commits for projects in states, local jurisdictions, regions, territories, and tribal reservations, as well as payments for eligible needs to help individuals and families. Contract awards refer to bids and agreements the federal government makes for specific goods and services. USAspending.gov also provides tools for examining the broader picture of federal spending obligations by categories, such as budget function, agency, and object class. Budget function refers to the major purpose that the spending serves, such as Social Security, Medicare, and national defense. Object class refers to the type of item or service purchased by the federal government, such as grants, contracts, and personnel compensation and benefits. For Congress, the ability to more accurately track these federal awards is necessary to better inform oversight of federal spending. In recent years, Congress has passed laws to create and improve systems used by government departments and agencies to report and input data on federal grants, contracts, loans, and other financial assistance: P.L. 109-282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), called for the creation of a database that became USAspending.gov. The publicly available database replaced data collection and annual reports issued for more than 30 years in the Census Bureau's Federal Aid to States (FAS) report and Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR). P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), required federal agencies awarding stimulus funding and state and local recipients of such funding to report spending back to the ARRA Recovery Board; this reporting also became a part of USAspending.gov. P.L. 113-101, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), transferred responsibility for USAspending.gov from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the Department of the Treasury and required that expenditures data be added to the federal agency obligations data already included in the USAspending.gov database. The DATA Act also required Treasury and OMB to develop government-wide data standardization to facilitate consolidating, automating, and simplifying reports on grant awards and contracts and to improve USAspending.gov underreporting and inconsistencies. However, finding accurate and complete data on federal funds received by states and congressional districts continues to be challenging due to ongoing data quality problems identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in June 2014. A GAO report released in November 2017 assessed the quality of data reported by agencies in May 2017 under new DATA Act standards. GAO identified issues and challenges with the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted, use of data elements, and disclosure of data limitations on what was, at the time, a beta version of the new USAspending.gov website. The beta version has since become the official site as of March 2018 and the previous version is no longer available. According to a note on the site, data quality and display improvements will be continually made on a rolling basis. Users of USAspending.gov should be aware that although search results may be useful for informing consideration of certain questions, these results may also be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.",
    "crs_R42695": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small business owners and prospective entrepreneurs. For example, it provides education programs to assist with business formation and expansion; loan guaranty programs to enhance small business owners' access to capital; and programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting, including oversight of the service-disabled veteran-owned small business federal procurement goaling program. The SBA also provides direct loans for owners of businesses of all sizes, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters. The Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program is also of interest to veterans. It provides direct loans of up to $2 million to small business owners who are not able to obtain credit elsewhere meet ordinary and necessary operating expenses that they could have met but are not able to because an essential employee has been called up to active duty in his or her role as a military reservist or member of the National Guard due to a period of military conflict. The SBA provides management and technical assistance to more than 100,000 veterans each year through its various training partners (e.g., Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, SCORE [formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives], and Veterans Business Outreach Centers [VBOCs]). In addition, the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) administers several programs to assist veteran-owned small businesses. The SBA's OVBD received an appropriation of $12.7 million for FY2018. The SBA has always assisted veteran small business owners and aspiring veteran entrepreneurs. In recent years, they have focused increased attention on assisting veterans transition from the military to the civilian labor force. For example, the SBA's OVBD, in partnership with Syracuse University, launched the Operation Boots to Business: From Service to Startup initiative for transitioning servicemembers in July 2012. The program consists of a two-day introductory course on entrepreneurship followed by an eight-week, online course to prepare servicemenmbers and military spouses \"for post-service career success as business owners.\" Congress provided the SBA's OVBD an additional $7 million in FY2014 to expand the Boots to Business initiative \"nationwide to the 250,000 yearly transitioning servicemembers in all branches of the military.\" The initiative's two-day Introduction to Entrepreneurship course is currently offered at 213 military institutions worldwide and is \"a standard portion of the curricula offered at the revised Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to servicemembers.\" TAP is administered by the Department of Defense (DOD) in cooperation with the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Education (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the SBA. Congress has approved additional appropriations to continue the initiative, and it was expanded in 2014 to include veterans of all eras, active duty servicemembers (including National Guard and Reserves), and their partner or spouse via the Boots to Business: Reboot initiative. In FY2017, 17,320 servicemembers participated in the Boots to Business program. During the 114th Congress, legislation was introduced and reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to provide the Boots to Business initiative statutory authorization (S. 1866, the Veterans Small Business Ownership Improvements Act of 2015). Similar legislation was introduced during the 115th Congress (S. 121, the Veterans Small Business Ownership Improvements Act, and H.R. 5193, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 2018). To date, nearly 70,000 servicemembers have participated in the initiative. The expansion of federal employment training programs targeted at specific populations, such as women and veterans, has led some Members and organizations to ask if these programs should be consolidated. In their view, eliminating program duplication among federal business assistance programs across federal agencies, and within the SBA, would lower costs and improve services. Others argue that keeping these business assistance programs separate enables them to offer services that match the unique needs of underserved populations, such as veterans. Instead of consolidating these programs, their focus is on improving communication and cooperation among the federal agencies providing assistance to entrepreneurs. The SBA administers several loan guaranty programs, including the 7(a) and the 504/CDC programs, to encourage lenders to provide loans to specific groups of borrowers identified by the SBA as having difficulty accessing capital. In the past, the Patriot Express program (2007-2013) encouraged lenders to provide loans to veterans and their spouses. It provided loans of up to $500,000 (with a guaranty of up to 85% of loans of $1",
    "crs_R40985": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including venture capital programs to provide \"long-term loans and equity capital to small businesses, especially those with potential for substantial job growth and economic impact\" and loan guaranty programs to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses \"that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions.\" Historically, one of the justifications presented for funding the SBA's access to capital programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage, compared with other businesses, when trying to obtain sufficient capital and credit. As an economist explained Growing firms need resources, but many small firms may have a hard time obtaining loans because they are young and have little credit history. Lenders may also be reluctant to lend to small firms with innovative products because it might be difficult to collect enough reliable information to correctly estimate the risk for such products. If it's true that the lending process leaves worthy projects unfunded, some suggest that it would be good to fix this \"market failure\" with government programs aimed at improving small businesses' access to credit. Congressional interest in the SBA's access to capital programs has increased in recent years, primarily because assisting small business in accessing capital is viewed as a means to enhance job creation and economic growth. Some have argued that the SBA should be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business and foster increased levels of economic growth and job creation. Economists generally do not view job creation as a justification for providing federal assistance to small businesses. They argue that in the long term such assistance will likely reallocate jobs within the economy, not increase them. However, economic theory does suggest that increased federal spending may result in additional jobs in the short term. For example, the SBA reported in September 2010 that the $730 million in additional funding provided to the agency by P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), created or retained 785,955 jobs.

They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business and foster increased levels of economic growth and job creation. Some advocates of providing additional resources to the SBA have argued that the federal government should enhance small business access to capital by creating a SBA direct lending program for small businesses. During the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-5, provided the SBA an additional $730 million, including $375 million to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program's maximum loan guaranty percentage from 85% on loans of $150,000 or less and 75% on loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) ($4.0 billion was issued) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. P.L. 111-157, the Continuing Extension Act of 2010, provided the SBA $80 million to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through May 31, 2010.

    "crs_R43792": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers. The FLSA mandates broad minimum wage coverage. It also specifies certain categories of workers who are not covered by general FLSA wage standards, such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers. In 1938, the FLSA established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour. The minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have been amended numerous times since then, typically to expand coverage or raise the wage rate. Since its establishment, the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times. The most recent change was enacted through P.L. 110-28 in 2007, which increased the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in three steps (the final step occurring in 2009). States generally have three options in setting their minimum wage policies: (1) they can set their own minimum wage provisions that differ from those in the FLSA, (2) they can explicitly tie their minimum wage provisions to the FLSA, or (3) they can include no specific minimum wage provisions in state law. In states with minimum wage rates above the federal minimum, variation occurs mainly across two dimensions: the rate and the mechanism of adjustment to the rate. State rates range from $0.25 to $6.75 above the federal minimum, with a majority of these states using some sort of inflation measure to index the state minimum wage. In the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate in 2019, minimum hourly rates range from $7.50 per hour in New Mexico to $12.00 per hour in Massachusetts and Washington and $14.00 in the District of Columbia. Of the states with minimum wage rates above $7.25: 3 states have minimum wages within $1 of the federal rate of $7.25 per hour; 10 states have rates between $1.00 and $2.00 per hour above the federal rate; and 16 states and the District of Columbia have rates greater than $2.00 per hour above the federal rate (i.e., $9.26 or higher). In terms of coverage, a majority of the civilian labor force is in states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate of $7.25. Specifically, the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above $7.25 represent about 61% of the total civilian labor force, which means the federal rate is the wage floor in states representing 39% of the labor force.",
    "crs_RL33785": "Running away from home is not a recent phenomenon. Folkloric heroes Huckleberry Finn and Davy Crockett fled their abusive fathers to find adventure and employment. Although some youth today also leave home due to abuse and neglect, they often endure far more negative outcomes than their romanticized counterparts from an earlier era. Without adequate and safe shelter, runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to engaging in high-risk behaviors and further victimization. Youth who live away from home for extended periods may become removed from school and systems of support. Runaway and homeless youth are vulnerable to multiple problems while they are away from a permanent home, including untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation. They also report other challenges including poor health and the lack of basic provisions. Congress began to hear concerns about the vulnerabilities of the runaway population in the 1970s due to increased awareness about these youth and the establishment of runaway shelters to assist them in returning home. Congress and the President went on to enact the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (P.L. 93-415) to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. Since that time, the law has been updated to authorize services to provide support for runaway and homeless youth outside of the juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act\u2014now known as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act\u2014authorized federal funding to be provided through annual appropriations for three programs that assist runaway and homeless youth: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Together, the programs make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The Basic Center Program provides funding to community-based organizations for crisis intervention, temporary shelter, counseling, family unification, and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families. In some cases, BCP-funded programs may serve older youth. Over 31,000 youth participated in FY2016, the most recent year for which data are available. Transitional Living Program supports community-based organizations that provide homeless youth ages 16 through 22 with stable, safe, longer-term residential services up to 18 months (or longer under certain circumstances), including counseling in basic life skills, building interpersonal skills, educational advancement, job attainment skills, and physical and mental health care. Over 6,000 youth participated in FY2016. Street Outreach Program provides funding to community-based organizations for street-based outreach and education, including treatment, counseling, provision of information, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, prostitution, and trafficking. SOP grantees made contact with more than 36,000 youth in FY2016. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act authorizes funding to be provided through annual appropriations for three programs that assist runaway and homeless youth: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Together, the programs make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The authorization of appropriations for the Basic Center Program and Transitional Living program is $127.4 million for each of FY2019 and FY2020. Under the law, 90% of the federal funds appropriated under the two programs must be used for the BCP and TLP (together, the programs and their related activities are known as the Consolidated Runaway and Homeless Youth program). Of this amount, 45% is reserved for the BCP and no more than 55% is reserved for the TLP. The remaining share of consolidated funding is allocated for (1) a national communication system to facilitate communication between service providers, runaway youth, and their families (National Safeline); (2) training and technical support for grantees; (3) evaluations of the programs; (4) federal coordination efforts on matters relating to the health, education, employment, and housing of these youth; and (5) studies of runaway and homeless youth.",

Direct support can often involve the transfer of billions of dollars each year. For example, USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) outlays on farm support programs have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017.

This variation has generated considerable interest\u2014by both the general public and Congress\u2014in who is eligible to participate in farm programs and, thus, may receive payments. The concern over program eligibility also derives, in part, from instances where farm payments have accrued to individuals who have never engaged in farming.

    "crs_R45111": "On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 into law (P.L. 115-123). Subtitle B of Title IV provided for the creation of a Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. The creation of this committee echoed a number of special panels created by Congress in the past in order to study and make recommendations on various issues unconstrained by existing committee jurisdictions. Prior examples include committees tasked with studying a wide spectrum of issues, including both budget process\u2014such as the Joint Committee to Study Budget Control (created by P.L. 92-599)\u2014and other topics, such as the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (also known as the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church, created by S.Res. 2, 94th Congress). The act directed the joint select committee to \"provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly reform the budget and appropriations process.\" The act stated that the committee provide recommendations and legislative language to significantly reform the budget and appropriations process. The committee was required to vote by November 30, 2018, on (1) a report containing a detailed statement of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the committee and (2) proposed legislative language to carry out those recommendations. The text of any report and proposed legislative language were required to be made publicly available in electronic form at least 24 hours prior to its consideration by the joint select committee. The act required the report and the proposed legislative language to be approved by a majority of each of (1) the committee members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate and (2) the committee members appointed by the House and Senate minority leaders. The law specified that nine members of the committee would constitute a quorum for purposes of voting and meeting, and five members of the committee would constitute a quorum for holding hearings. The act established certain unique procedures for Senate consideration of any legislative language reported by the joint select committee. These procedures were intended to allow the Senate to reach a timely vote on the question of whether or not to consider legislation embodying the recommendations of the joint select committee, but the act did not specify any procedures governing consideration of the bill once the Senate agreed to take it up. There were no provisions in the law concerning the consideration of the recommendations of the joint select committee in the House. There were also no provisions concerning resolving any differences between the House and Senate or the consideration of a veto message from the President. Such actions would have occurred under the regular procedures of each chamber. The joint select committee held five days of public hearings. The committee held multiple meetings, both formal and informal, to provide its members a forum to discuss reforms to the budget and appropriations process. These meetings\u2014including working sessions on August 22, September 13, and September 26, 2018,\u2014provided the basis for the recommendations that were subsequently incorporated into draft legislation to be considered by the committee as the cochair's mark. The cochair's mark included a recommendation that the budget resolution be adopted for a two-year cycle rather than the current annual cycle. The draft also addressed a number of related concerns, such as allowing reconciliation instructions for both years of a biennium, providing for a revision of the budget resolution in the second session of a Congress to update it for scoring purposes, and revising the requirements concerning the submission and content of the President's budget in the second year of a biennium. The recommendations also provided for a change in the membership of the Senate Budget Committee to be comprised of eight members from the majority and seven members from the minority, including the chairs and ranking members from the Appropriations and Finance Committees, and for the House and Senate Budget Committees to hold a joint hearing on the fiscal state of the nation. On November 15, 2018, the committee began marking up the draft legislation. In that markup, the committee agreed by unanimous consent to apply a voting rule for the adoption of amendments consistent with the rule required by the act for final adoption of any recommendations. This agreement required separate majorities of the appointees from each party. The markup continued on November 27 and 29. The final vote on reporting the draft bill, as amended, was not agreed to by a roll-call vote of one aye and seven noes of the Members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader and seven ayes and zero noes of the Members appointed by the House minority leader and the Senate minority leader.",
    "crs_R45711": "\"Too big to fail\" (TBTF) is the concept that a financial firm's disorderly failure would cause widespread disruptions in financial markets and result in devastating economic and societal outcomes that the government would feel compelled to prevent, perhaps by providing direct support to the firm. Such firms are a source of systemic risk\u2014the potential for widespread disruption to the financial system, as occurred in 2008 when the securities firm Lehman Brothers failed. Although TBTF has been a perennial policy issue, it was highlighted by the near-collapse of several large financial firms in 2008. Some of the large firms were nonbank financial firms, but a few were depository institutions. To avert the imminent failures of Wachovia and Washington Mutual, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) arranged for them to be acquired by other banks without government financial assistance. Citigroup and Bank of America were offered additional preferred shares through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and government guarantees on selected assets they owned. In many of these cases, policymakers justified government intervention on the grounds that the firms were \"systemically important\" (popularly understood to be synonymous with too big to fail). Some firms were rescued on those grounds once the crisis struck, although the government had no explicit policy to rescue TBTF firms beforehand. In response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (hereinafter, the Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203), a comprehensive financial regulatory reform, was enacted in 2010. Among its stated purposes are \"to promote the financial stability of the United States..., [and] to end 'too big to fail,' to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts.\" The Dodd-Frank Act took a multifaceted approach to addressing the TBTF problem. This report focuses on one pillar of that approach\u2014the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) enhanced (heightened) prudential regulation for large banks and nonbank financial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The Dodd-Frank Act automatically subjected all bank holding companies and foreign banks with more than $50 billion in assets to enhanced prudential regulation (EPR). In addition, Basel III (a nonbinding international agreement that U.S. banking regulators implemented through rulemaking after the financial crisis) included several capital requirements that only apply to large banks. In 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (referred to herein as P.L. 115-174) eliminated most EPR requirements for banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion. Banks that have been designated as Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) by the Financial Stability Board (an international, intergovernmental forum) or have more than $250 billion in assets automatically remain subject to all EPR requirements, as modified. P.L. 115-174 gives the Fed discretion to apply most individual EPR provisions to banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets on a case-by-case basis only if it would promote financial stability or the institution's safety and soundness. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a group of specific prudential requirements that apply only to large banks. Some of these requirements related to capital and liquidity overlap with parts of the Basel III international agreement. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a group of specific prudential requirements that apply only to large banks. Some of these requirements directly address problems or regulatory shortcomings that arose during the financial crisis. As of the date of this report, no bank has experienced financial difficulties since EPR came into effect, but the economy has not experienced a downturn in which financial difficulties at banks become more likely. Thus, the risk mitigation provisions that have shown robustness in an expansion have not yet proven to be robust in a downturn, while the provisions intended to cope with a failing bank remain untested. Finally, some parts of enhanced regulation cannot be evaluated because, as of the date of this report, they still have not been implemented through final rules. The Dodd-Frank Act and the other bank regulators have proposed several rules that would modify EPR. One set of rules, implementing Section 401 of P.L. 115-174, would raise the asset thresholds for EPR. This rule would exempt banks with less than $100 billion in assets from EPR and reduce EPR requirements mostly for banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets. A second proposed rule, implementing Section 402 of P.L. 115-174, would reduce capital requirements under the SLR for three custody banks, two of which are G",
    "crs_R45723": "Fiscal policy is the means by which the government adjusts its budget balance through spending and revenue changes to influence broader economic conditions. According to mainstream economics, the government can impact the level of economic activity, generally measured by gross domestic product (GDP), in the short term by changing its level of spending and tax revenue. Expansionary fiscal policy\u2014an increase in government spending, a decrease in tax revenue, or a combination of the two\u2014is expected to spur economic activity, whereas contractionary fiscal policy\u2014a decrease in government spending, an increase in tax revenue, or a combination of the two\u2014is expected to slow economic activity. When the government's budget is running a deficit, fiscal policy is said to be expansionary: when it is running a surplus, fiscal policy is said to be contractionary. From a policymaker's perspective, expansionary fiscal policy is generally used to boost GDP growth and the economic indicators that tend to move with GDP, such as employment and individual incomes. However, expansionary fiscal policy also tends to affect interest rates and investment, exchange rates and the trade balance, and the inflation rate in undesirable ways, limiting the long-term effectiveness of persistent fiscal stimulus. Contractionary fiscal policy can be used to slow economic activity if policymakers are concerned that the economy may be overheating, which can cause a recession. The magnitude of fiscal policy's effect on GDP will also differ based on where the economy is within the business cycle\u2014whether it is in a recession or an expansion. Persistently applying fiscal stimulus can negatively affect the economy through three main avenues. First, persistent large budget deficits can result in a rising debt-to-GDP ratio and lead to an unsustainable level of debt. Second, persistent fiscal stimulus\u2014particularly during economic expansions\u2014can limit long-term economic growth by crowding out private investment. Third, rising public debt will require a growing portion of the federal budget to be directed toward interest payments on the debt, potentially crowding out other, more worthwhile sources of government spending. With improving economic conditions, policymakers may choose to begin withdrawing fiscal stimulus by decreasing the size of the deficit or potentially by applying contractionary fiscal policy and running a budget surplus. From a policymaker's perspective, expansionary fiscal policy is generally used to boost GDP growth and the economic indicators that tend to move with GDP, such as employment and individual incomes. However, expansionary fiscal policy also tends to affect interest rates and investment, exchange rates and the trade balance, and the inflation rate in undesirable ways, limiting the long-term effectiveness of persistent fiscal stimulus.

    "crs_R44968": "Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) constitute the Army's \"light\" ground forces and are an important part of the nation's ability to rapidly project forces overseas. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as current thinking as to where and how future conflicts would be fought, suggest IBCTs are limited operationally by their lack of assigned transport and reconnaissance vehicles as well as firepower against hardened targets and armored vehicles. To address these limitations, the Army is undertaking three programs: the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), formerly known as the Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) programs. These programs would be based on vehicles that are commercially available. This is in order to reduce costs and the time it takes to field combat vehicles associated with traditional developmental efforts. Congress may be concerned with the effectiveness of ground forces over the full spectrum of military operations. A number of past unsuccessful Army acquisition programs have served to heighten congressional oversight of Army programs, including nondevelopmental programs such as those currently being proposed for IBCTs. In addition to these primary concerns, how these new programs affect deployability and sustainability of IBCTs as well as affordability could be potential oversight issues for Congress.",
    "crs_R45508": "U.S. insurers and Congress face new policy issues and questions related to the opportunities and risks presented by the growth in the international insurance market and trade in insurance products. Insurance is often seen as a localized product and U.S. insurance regulation has addressed this through a state-centric regulatory system. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, gives primacy to the individual states, and every state has its own insurance regulator and state laws governing insurance. Although the risks of loss and the regulation may be local, the business of insurance, as with many financial services, has an increasingly substantial international component as companies look to grow and diversify. The international aspects of insurance have spurred the creation of a variety of entities and measures, both domestic and foreign, to facilitate the trade and regulation of insurance services. Financial services have been addressed in a number of U.S. trade agreements going back to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) was created more than 20 years ago, largely under the impetus of the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), to promote cooperation and exchange of information among insurance supervisors, including development of regulatory standards. The 2007-2009 financial crisis sparked further international developments, with heads of state of the G-20 nations creating the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The postcrisis 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) altered the U.S. insurance regulatory system, particularly as it relates to international issues. With the states continuing as the primary insurance regulators, following Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve exercised holding company oversight over insurers who owned a bank subsidiary or who were designated for enhanced supervision (popularly known as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs) by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC includes a presidentially appointed, independent voting member with insurance expertise as well as a state regulator as a nonvoting member. The Federal Reserve, already a major actor in efforts at the FSB and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, thus became a significant insurance supervisor and joined the IAIS shortly thereafter. Dodd-Frank also created a new Federal Insurance Office (FIO). The FIO is not a federal insurance regulator, but is tasked with representing the United States in international fora and, along with the United States Trade Representative (USTR), can negotiate international covered agreements relating to insurance prudential measures. The FIO also became a member of the IAIS and is participating significantly in IAIS efforts to create insurance capital standards. The new federal involvement in insurance issues, both domestic and international, has created frictions both among the federal entities and between the states and the federal entities, and has been a subject of both congressional hearings and proposed legislation. This report discusses trade in insurance services and summarizes the various international entities and agreements affecting the regulation of and trade in insurance. It then addresses particular issues and controversies in greater depth, including the concluded U.S.-EU covered agreement, pending U.S.-UK covered agreement, and issues relating to international insurance standards.

    "crs_RS22549": "The Older Americans Act (OAA, P.L. 89-73, as amended) is the primary federal vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services for older persons. The majority of OAA grant funds are provided to states and other entities based on statutory formulas that exist in the following titles: Title III, Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging; Title V, Community Service Employment for Older Americans; Title VI, Grants for Older Native Americans; and Title VII, Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection Activities. These formula grants fund programs that assist older Americans with supportive services in their homes; congregate nutrition services (meals served at group sites such as senior centers, community centers, schools, churches, or senior housing complexes); home-delivered nutrition services; family caregiver support; community service employment; the long-term care ombudsman program; and services to prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older persons. The OAA also supports grants to older Native Americans for nutrition and supportive services. Since enactment of OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act, including changes to four Title III programs that receive funding under statutory formulas. Prior to the 2016 OAA reauthorization, the OAA Amendments of 2006 (P.L. 109-365) reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. Although the authorizations of appropriations under the OAA expired at the end of FY2011, Congress continued to appropriate funding for OAA-authorized activities through FY2016. For most OAA programs, entities such as states, U.S. territories, and tribal organizations are allotted funding based on a population-based formula factor (e.g., aged 55 and over, aged 60 and over, or aged 70 and over). Some statutory requirements for program funding allocations include a \"hold harmless\" provision, which guarantees that states' or other entities' allotments will remain at a certain fiscal year level or amount, provided sufficient funding in a given year (e.g., FY2000 levels or FY2018 levels less 1%). The OAA reauthorization of 2016 did not revise the Title V funding formula, but the formula had been an issue for Congress in the past. During the 2006 OAA reauthorization, the original House bill (H.R. 5293) included a provision to update the \"hold harmless\" year in the Title V formula from FY2000 to FY2006; however, the Senate bill (S. 3570) did not include this provision. The compromise bill (H.R. 6197) enacted into law made no changes to the Title V formula. The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services has been a point of contention during the past three OAA reauthorizations of 2000, 2006, and 2016. The Title III funding formula for supportive services and senior centers, the congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, and disease prevention and health promotion services continued to be a major point of contention during the past three OAA reauthorizations of 2000, 2006, and 2016.

Cluster munitions are valued militarily because one munition can kill or destroy many targets within its impact area, and fewer weapons systems are needed to deliver fewer munitions to attack multiple targets. Cluster munitions also permit a smaller force to engage a larger adversary and are considered by some an \"economy of force\" weapon. Many cluster munitions rely on simple mechanical fuzes that arm the submunition based on its rate of spin and explode on impact or after a time delay. A newer generation of sensor-fuzed submunitions is being introduced by a number of nations to improve the munitions' and submunitions' accuracy and to reduce the large number of residual unexploded submunitions.

    "crs_R44891": "The U.S. role in the world since the end of World War II in 1945 (i.e., over the past 70 years or so) is generally described as one of global leadership and significant engagement in international affairs. Observers over the years have referred to the U.S. role in the world using various terms and phrases that sometimes reflect varying degrees of approval or disapproval of that role. It has been variously described as that of global leader, leader of the free world, superpower, hyperpower, indispensable power, system administrator, world policeman, or world hegemon. Similarly, the United States has also been described as pursuing an internationalist foreign policy, a foreign policy of global engagement or deep engagement, a foreign policy of liberal order building, liberal internationalism, or liberal hegemony, an interventionist foreign policy, or a foreign policy of seeking primacy or world hegemony. The fact that the U.S. role in the world has been generally stable over the past 70 years does not necessarily mean that this role was the right one for the United States, or that it would be the right one in the future. Although the role the United States has played in the world since the end of World War II has many defenders, it also has critics, and the merits of that role have been a matter of long-standing debate among foreign policy specialists, strategists, policymakers, and the public, with critics offering potential alternative concepts for the U.S. role in the world. One major dimension of the debate is whether the United States should attempt to continue playing the active internationalist role that it has played for the past 70 years, or instead adopt a more-restrained role that reduces U.S. involvement in world affairs. A number of critics of the U.S. role in the world over the past 70 years have offered multiple variations on the idea of a more-restrained U.S. role. A second major dimension within the debate over the future U.S. role concerns how to balance or combine the pursuit of narrowly defined material U.S. interests with the goal of defending and promoting U.S. or universal values such as democracy, freedom, and human rights. A third major dimension concerns the balance in U.S. foreign policy between the use of hard power and soft power. Observers debating these two dimensions of the future U.S. role in the world stake out varying positions on these questions. The overall issue for Congress is how to respond to recent developments regarding the U.S. role in the world. Congress's decisions on this issue could have significant implications for numerous policies, plans, programs, and budgets, and for the role of Congress relative to that of the executive branch in U.S. foreign policymaking.

    "crs_R45486": "The term child nutrition programs refers to several U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food to children in institutional settings. The largest are the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which subsidize free, reduced-price, and full-price meals in participating schools. Also operating in schools, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides funding for fruit and vegetable snacks in participating elementary schools, and the Special Milk Program provides support for milk in schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP. Other child nutrition programs include the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides meals and snacks in child care and after-school settings, and the Summer Food Service Program, which provides food during the summer months. The child nutrition programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296). On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created or extended by the HHFKA expired. However, these expirations had a minimal impact on program operations, as the child nutrition programs have continued with funding provided by annual appropriations acts. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization, which refers to the process of reauthorizing and potentially making changes to multiple permanent statutes\u2014the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and sometimes Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935. Both committees of jurisdiction\u2014the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2014reported reauthorization legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003), respectively. This legislation died at the end of the 114th Congress, as is the case for any bill that has not yet passed both chambers and been sent to the President at the end of a Congress. There were no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress; however, 2018 farm bill proposals and the final enacted bill included a few provisions related to child nutrition programs. The implementation of the HHFKA, child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 114th Congress, and the child nutrition-related topics raised during 2018 farm bill negotiations have raised issues that may be relevant for Congress in future reauthorization efforts or other policymaking opportunities. These issues often relate to the content and type of foods served in schools: for example, the nutritional quality of foods and whether foods are domestically sourced. Other issues relate to access, including alternatives to on-site consumption in summer meals and implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision, an option to provide free meals to all students in certain schools. Stakeholders in these issues commonly include school food authorities (SFAs; school food service departments that generally operate at the school district level), hunger and nutrition-focused advocacy organizations, and food industry organizations, among others.

The United States is unique among \"presidential\" republics by providing an indirect election to choose its chief executive. The President and Vice President are selected not by registered voters, but by the electoral college, electors appointed in the states \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... \" This grant of authority provides the constitutional basis claimed for the NPV initiative. In practice, all states currently provide for popular election of their electoral college delegations. The winning presidential nominees must gain a national majority of 270 or more electoral votes, out of the 538 total, in order to be elected. If no ticket of candidates attains a majority, then the House of Representatives elects the President, and the Senate the Vice President, in a procedure known as contingent election. Candidates for the office of elector are selected by their respective political parties. They are expected to vote for the presidential and vice presidential candidates to whom they are pledged. Some states seek to require them to so vote by law or other means, but most constitutional scholars hold that the electors remain free agents under the Constitution, and that they may vote for any person they choose. On rare occasions, an elector will vote for a different candidate, or abstain from casting a vote for any candidate; he or she is known as a \"faithless elector.\" The goal of presidential campaigns under the existing system is to win by carrying states that collectively cast a majority of electoral votes. Political parties and presidential campaigns tend to focus on states that are closely contested (widely referred to as \"battleground\" states), or that have large delegations of electoral votes, or both. Winning a majority of the more populous and/or battleground states is considered crucial to obtaining the necessary electoral vote majority. In 48 states and the District of Columbia, the presidential/vice presidential ticket winning the most popular votes (a plurality or more) in that state is awarded all its electoral votes. That is to say, the winning party's entire ticket of electors is elected. This is referred to as the \"winner-take-all\" or \"general ticket\" system. The NPV initiative seeks to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact, rather than by constitutional amendment. Ideally, under the compact's provisions, legislatures of the 50 states and the District of Columbia would pass legislation binding the signatories to appoint presidential electors committed to the presidential/vice presidential ticket that gained the most votes nationwide. If all 50 states and the District of Columbia were compact members, this would deliver a unanimous electoral college decision for the candidates winning a plurality of the popular vote. NPV supporters argue that the process would be simple, national, and democratic; the NPV interstate compact would provide de facto for a single, democratic choice, allowing all the nation's voters to choose the President and Vice President directly, with no intermediaries. The \"people's choice,\" they assert, would win in every election, and every vote would carry the same weight in the election, no matter where in the nation it was cast. No state would be advantaged, nor would any be disadvantaged. According to NPV, there would never again be a presidential election \"misfire\" or another \"wrong winner.\" Other elements of the electoral college system criticized by NPV advocates (and other electoral college reformers) would arguably disappear or be rendered irrelevant. Proponents of the NPV initiative arguably share the philosophical criticism voiced by proponents of direct popular election, who maintain that the electoral college system is intrinsically undemocratic\u2014it provides for \"indirect\" election of the President and Vice President. This, they assert, is an 18th century anachronism, dating from a time when communications were poor, the literacy rate was much lower, and the nation had yet to develop the durable, sophisticated, and inclusive democratic political system it now enjoys. They maintain that only direct popular election of the President and Vice President is consistent with modern democratic values and practice. Beyond this fundamental challenge, critics cite what they identify as a wide range of technical failings of the electoral college arrangement. Perhaps the most prominent of these is that the electoral college system can result in the election of a President and Vice President who have won the electoral vote, but gained fewer popular votes than their major opponent. This condition results at least in part from the nearly universal reliance on the \"winner",
    "crs_RS22350": "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). These acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. Recently, railroad employment peaked in April 2015 to 253,000 workers, the highest level since November 1999, and then declined through FY2017, falling to 221,000 workers. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. During FY2017, the RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants. Railroad retirement, disability, and survivor benefits are financed solely by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). Railroad retirement payroll taxes are divided into two tiers\u2014Tier I and Tier II taxes. Tier I payroll taxes are deposited in the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account (SSEBA), which pays the Social Security level of benefits and administrative expenses allocable to those benefits. Tier II taxes are used to finance Tier II benefits, the portion of Tier I benefits in excess of Social Security retirement benefits (such as unreduced early retirement benefits for railroad employees with at least 30 years of railroad service), and supplemental annuities. Tier II taxes are used to finance Tier II benefits, the portion of Tier I benefits in excess of Social Security retirement benefits (such as unreduced early retirement benefits for railroad employees with at least 30 years of railroad service), and supplemental annuities. Tier II tax revenues that are not needed to pay current benefits or associated administrative costs are held in the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), which is invested in both government securities and private equities.

    "crs_RL33741": "The Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program is a relatively inexpensive Navy surface combatant that is to be equipped with modular \"plug-and-fight\" mission packages, including unmanned vehicles (UVs). The Navy announced the start of the LCS program on November 1, 2001. The first LCS was procured in FY2005, and a total of 35 have been procured through FY2018, including three in FY2019. The LCS program includes the development and procurement of antisubmarine warfare (ASW), mine countermeasures (MCM), and surface warfare (SUW) mission packages. Additional potential missions for LCS include peacetime engagement and partnership-building operations; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR operations); maritime security and intercept operations (including anti-piracy operations); support of Marines or special operations forces; and homeland defense operations. The LCS program has been controversial over the years due to past cost growth, design and construction issues with the first LCSs, concerns over the survivability of LCSs (i.e., their ability to withstand battle damage), concerns over whether LCSs are sufficiently armed and would be able to perform their stated missions effectively, and concerns over the development and testing of the modular mission packages for LCSs. The LCS program has been modified or restructured several times over the years, in part to address these issues. The Navy's execution of the program has been a matter of congressional oversight attention for several years, particularly for a period of about 10 years starting around 2007, when significant cost growth in the program came to light. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan, the SSC force is to grow to 52 ships (34 LCSs and 18 FFG[X]s) in FY2034, reach a peak of 62 ships (30 LCSs, 20 FFG[X]s, and 12 SSCs of a future design) in FY2040, and then decline to 50 ships (20 FFG[X]s and 30 SSCs of a future design) in FY2049. The Navy wants FY2019 to be the final year of LCS procurement, and it has not requested the procurement of any additional LCSs in its FY2020 budget submission. The Navy wants to shift procurement of small surface combatants in FY2020 from the LCS to a new frigate called the FFG(X). The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of the first FFG(X). The FFG(X) program is covered in detail in CRS Report R44972, Navy Frigate (FFG[X]) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. A current issue for Congress regarding the LCS program is whether to procure any additional LCSs in FY2020, and if so, how many. Another issue for Congress concerns future workloads and employment levels at the two LCS shipyards if one or both of these yards are not involved in building FFG(X)s. Congress's decisions on the LCS program will affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the LCS program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke.",

    "crs_R42463": "The World Bank is a multilateral development bank (MDB) that offers loans and grants to low- and middle-income countries to promote poverty alleviation and economic development. The World Bank has near-universal membership, with 189 member nations. U.S. membership in the World Bank is authorized by a federal statute known as the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286 et seq.). Only Cuba and North Korea, and a few microstates such as the Vatican, Monaco, and Andorra, are nonmembers. Two of the Bank's five facilities, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA), lend directly to governments to finance development projects and policy programs in member countries. The IBRD provides middle-income developing countries with loans at near-market rates using funds raised by the World Bank on international capital markets. IDA was established in 1960 due to concerns that low-income countries could not afford to borrow at the near-market rate terms offered by the IBRD. IDA provides grants and concessional loans funded by contributions from donors and transfers from the IBRD to low-income countries. The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank, having the largest share of the IBRD's subscribed capital, $46.4 billion (16.88%) of a total of $275 billion. As the largest contributor, the United States holds a single seat on the 25-member Board of Executive Directors and carries 16.32% of the total votes in Bank decisionmaking, which provides veto power on decisions requiring an 85% majority vote. The largest shareholders after the United States are Japan (6.89% of voting power), China (4.45%), Germany (4.03%), France (3.78%), and the United Kingdom (3.78%). The large voting power of the United States ensures the U.S. ability to veto major policy decisions at the Bank. The formal guidelines for choosing the World Bank president are laid out in the Bank's Articles of Agreements and Bylaws. Article V, Section 5, states that \"[t]he Executive Board shall select a President who shall not be a Governor or an Executive Director. \" This decision may be reached by a simple majority of the Executive Board. Section 13(c) of the Bank's bylaws stipulates the terms of service. World Bank presidents are elected for renewable five-year terms. Neither the articles nor the bylaws articulate any specific qualifications for the position of president of the World Bank. The Bank's Articles of Agreement, however, are silent on any requirements on how individuals are selected, on what criteria, or by what process they are vetted. There is no formal search process for candidates. Nominations can only be made by the 25 World Bank executive directors and there is no concerted search process of the Executive Board to identify and vet possible candidates. Critics point out that the agreed procedures remain vague and largely nontransparent. Most notably, development expertise is not included as a qualification and the decision will be taken not by public vote, but rather by consensus according to prior practice. Declaring the importance of an \"open, transparent, and merit-based\" process, yet continuing to perpetuate the status quo, according to three former World Bank chief economists, is hypocritical, and \"destroys the trust and spirit of collaboration needed to manage the profound problems facing the world.\" The European-U.S. arrangement to split the leadership at the IMF and World Bank has generated controversy, which may undermine the effectiveness of the eventual nominee. Critics of the current selection process make two general arguments. First, the gentlemen's agreement on IMF and World Bank leadership is seen as a relic of a global economy that no longer exists. Whereas the United States and Europe dominated the postwar economy, the current international economy is more diverse. Developing and emerging market countries contribute half of global output, up from 25% 30 years ago. Over the past several decades, the balance of global economic power has been shifting from the United States and Europe to China and a number of other fast-developing countries. These economies account for rising shares of global GDP, manufacturing, and trade, and also are driven by a significant expansion of trade among the developing countries (South-South trade). These shifts are driven by growing economic integration and interdependence among economies, particularly through new global production and supply chains that incorporate inputs from many different countries.",
    "crs_RS21513": "Kuwait's optimism after the 2003 fall of its nemesis, Saddam Husein, soured after the January 15, 2006, death of Amir (ruler) Jabir Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah. From then until 2013, Kuwait underwent repeated political crises that produced economic stagnation. The Amir appoints a Prime Minister as head of government, who in turn appoints a cabinet. The Prime Minister has always been a member of the Sabah family, and until 2003 the Prime Minister and Crown Prince/heir apparent posts were held by a single person. It is typical of Kuwaiti cabinets that most of the key ministries (defense, foreign policy, and finance) are led by Sabah family members. At the time of Amir's death, his designated successor, Shaykh Sa'ad bin Abdullah Al Sabah, was infirm. A brief succession dispute among rival branches of the ruling Al Sabah family was resolved with then-Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah, the younger brother of the late Amir, becoming Amir on January 29, 2006, although the long-standing tacit agreement to alternate succession between the Jabir and Salem branches of the family was suspended. Amir Sabah appointed two members of his Jabir branch as Crown Prince/heir apparent and as prime minister (Shaykh Nawwaf al-Ahmad Al Sabah and Shaykh Nasser al Muhammad al-Ahmad Al Sabah respectively). The succession dispute was unprecedented for the involvement of an elected legislature in replacing a Kuwait leader. Amir Sabah tends to be more directly involved in governance than was his predecessor. Still, there reportedly is growing discussion within Al Sabah circles about the succession. The current Prime Minister, Shaykh Jabir al-Mubarak Al Sabah, has been in office since December 2011. The Amir dissolved the cabinet in October 2017, with a policy outlook similar to that of the previous cabinet. The Amir's son was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister. Two of the appointees were women\u2014the Minister of Social and Labor Affairs, and the Minister of State for Housing and for Services Affairs. The next National Assembly elections are due to be held in 2020. Elections for vacant seats are held periodically, including by-elections for two vacant seats to be held in March 2019. The Amir has met with President Trump on three occasions, most recently September 5, 2018, focusing on regional issues including the U.S. concept of an anti-Iran Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA). Another U.S.-Kuwait Strategic Dialogue meeting was to be held during Secretary of State Michael Pompeo's trip to the Gulf states in January 2019, but the Secretary was compelled to return to the United States before reaching Kuwait due to a death in his family. Kuwait's military has regained its pre-Iraq invasion strength of 17,000. U.S. officials say that the U.S. training and mentorship has improved the quality of the Kuwaiti military, particularly the Air Force.

In the 1990s, Georgia enjoyed a brief period of independence from 1918 until its forcible incorporation into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, or Soviet Union) in 1921-1922. Georgia gained independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Georgia is located in the South Caucasus, a region between the Black and Caspian Seas and separated from Russia by the Greater Caucasus mountain range. The South Caucasus also borders Iran and Turkey. Georgia has a unicameral legislature with 150 members elected for four-year terms by two methods: 77 by party list and 73 by majoritarian district. The most recent parliamentary elections in 2016 resulted in a sizeable win for Georgia's center-left ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), which initially led a ruling coalition after coming to power in 2012 and now governs alone. GD won 49% of the party list vote and nearly all majoritarian races, leading to control of more than 75% of parliamentary seats (116 of 150 deputies). Before losing this supermajority in February 2019, GD had enough votes to unilaterally enact changes to Georgia's constitution. This led many observers and opposition supporters to express concern that there were insufficient checks and balances against the ruling party. GD's main competitor in 2016 was the center-right United National Movement (UNM), the former ruling party previously led by ex-president Mikheil Saakashvili. The UNM received 27% of the party vote and 27 seats (18%). After months of infighting, the UNM fragmented in 2017, and most of its deputies, including much of the party's senior leadership, formed a new opposition party called European Georgia-Movement for Liberty. A third electoral bloc, the nationalist-conservative Alliance of Patriots of Georgia-United Opposition, cleared the 5% threshold to enter parliament with six seats. The most recent presidential elections were held in two rounds in October and November 2018. The victor, Salome Zurabishvili, won 60% of the vote in the second round. Zurabishvili ran as an independent candidate, although she was supported by GD. UNM candidate Grigol Vashadze, like Zurabishvili an ex-foreign minister, received 40%. The first round of the election was a closer race (39% to 38%), but Zurabishvili appeared to benefit from greater turnout in the runoff (56%, compared to 46% in the first round). Domestic and international observers considered the election to be competitive but flawed. Observers noted instances of official pressure against state employees to support Zurabishvili, as well as incidents of ballot box stuffing. They also expressed concern about allegations of mass vote-buying, related to Prime Minister Bakhtadze's pre-runoff announcement that a philanthropic foundation associated with GD founder and chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili had agreed to purchase and forgive the small private debts of more than 600,000 individuals.

    "crs_R43960": "The United States, Saudi Arabia, and other members of the international community have been engaged in a long-running, multilateral conflict in Yemen. The conflict began in 2011, when political unrest broke out throughout the Arab world. Popular youth protests in Yemen were gradually supplanted by political elites jockeying to replace then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Ultimately, infighting among various centers of Yemeni political power broke out in the capital, and government authority throughout the country eroded. Soon, militias associated with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) seized territory in one southern province. Concerned that the political unrest and resulting security vacuum were strengthening terrorist elements, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other members of the international community attempted to broker a political compromise. A transition plan was brokered, and in 2012 former Vice President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi became president. With the support of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Nations Security Council, President Hadi attempted to reform Yemen's political system. Throughout 2013, key players convened a National Dialogue Conference aimed at reaching broad national consensus on a new political order. However, in January 2014 it ended without agreement. One antigovernment group in particular, the northern Yemeni Houthi movement, sought to use military force to reshape the political order. Within weeks of the National Dialogue Conference concluding, it launched a military offensive against various tribal allies of President Hadi. The Houthi were joined by the forces still loyal to former President Saleh, creating an alliance of convenience that was a formidable opponent to President Hadi and his allies. In 2014, Houthi militants took over the capital of Sanaa (also spelled Sana'a) and violated several power-sharing arrangements. In 2015, Houthi forces advanced southward from the capital all the way to Aden on the Arabian Sea. In March 2015, after President Hadi, who had fled to Saudi Arabia, appealed for international intervention, Saudi Arabia and a hastily assembled international coalition launched a military offensive aimed at restoring Hadi's rule and evicting Houthi fighters from the capital and other major cities. In April 2015, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution (UNSCR) 2216 demanding that Houthi-Saleh forces end their use of violence and that all Yemeni parties avoid \"further unilateral actions that could undermine the political transition in Yemen.\" The United States agreed to provide limited assistance to the coalition military operations, assistance which has evolved over time in response to conditions in the conflict and in light of congressional scrutiny. In early December 2017, the Houthi-Saleh alliance unraveled, culminating in the killing of former President Saleh on December 4, 2017. Since Saleh's death, the coalition has made military gains, advancing northward along the Red Sea coast toward the port of Hudaydah (also spelled Hodeidah, Hudayda). Nevertheless, Houthi forces remain ensconced in northern Yemen and remain in control of the capital. The war has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that began in 2011; as of January 2019, over half of the population required emergency food assistance. Access restrictions to certain areas of Yemen make it problematic for governments and aid agencies to count the war's casualties. One U.S. and European-funded organization, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), estimates that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016. UNHCR estimates that 3.9 million Yemenis were displaced internally as of January 2019. In January 2019, the United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen released their annual report covering 2018. This report noted that Yemen continues to \"slide towards humanitarian and economic catastrophe.\" Though the actual ground war remains confined to \"relatively small areas,\" the effect of the conflict on the economy, as well as the growing presence of armed groups and deep-rooted corruption, has impacted ordinary Yemenis within both Houthi-held areas and liberated areas. The United States has continued to support United Nations-led efforts in addressing the humanitarian situation and working toward a comprehensive peace in Yemen. At the same time, the United States has continued to cooperate with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in countering terrorism and attempting to limit Iran's influence in Yemen. For the Trump Administration, U.S. officials have supported the continued defense of Saudi Arabia against Houthi missile and rocket strikes, while also openly calling on coalition members to use air power judiciously to minimize civilian casualties.

A defense item is defined by regulation as one that \"[m]eets the criteria of a defense article or defense service on the U.S. Munitions List\" or \"[p]rovides the equivalent performance capabilities of a defense article\" on that list. Dual-use goods are commodities, software, or technologies that have both civilian and military applications. The United States also controls certain exports in adherence to several multilateral nonproliferation control regimes. In addition, U.S. export controls are used to restrict exports to certain countries on which the United States imposes economic sanctions, such as Cuba, Iran, and Syria. Through the Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECA; P.L. 115-232, Subtitle B, Part I), which became law on August 13, 2018, provides broad, detailed legislative authority for the President to implement dual-use export controls. The law repeals the Export Administration Act (EAA; P.L. 96-72), which was the underlying statutory authority for dual-use export controls until it expired in 2001. After the EAA's expiration, the export control system created pursuant to that law was continued by a presidential declaration of a national emergency and the invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA; P.L. 95-223). The ECA, which has no expiration date, requires the President to control \"the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of items subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, whether by United States persons or by foreign persons,\" as well as the activities of United States persons, wherever located, relating to specific (A) nuclear explosive devices; (B) missiles; (C) chemical or biological weapons; (D) whole plants for chemical weapons precursors; (E) foreign maritime nuclear projects; and (F) foreign military intelligence services. The ECA requires the Secretary of Commerce to \"establish and maintain a list\" of controlled items and \"foreign persons and end-uses that are determined to be a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\"; require export licenses; \"prohibit unauthorized exports, reexports, and in-country transfers of controlled items\"; and \"monitor shipments and other means of transfer.\" The AECA also contains the statutory authority for the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, under which the U.S. government sells U.S. defense equipment, services, and training on a government-to-government basis. The law also specifies criteria for Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), whereby eligible foreign governments and international organizations purchase some defense articles and services directly from U.S. firms.

Enforcement of the U.S. export control system is undertaken by the agencies responsible for export licensing, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the National Security Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS). Their activities can be summarized as follows: Offi ce of Export Enforcement (OEE) of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce. OEE investigates criminal and administrative violations of the dual-use export control regime. OEE is authorized to conduct domestic investigations and works with the Defense Security Service and the Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) units at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Office of Defense Trade Compliance (ODTC) in the Department of State.

DDTC also coordinates the Blue Lantern end-use monitoring program, in which in-country U.S. embassy officials conduct prelicense checks and postshipment verifications of items transferred via DCS. The AECA provides for criminal penalties of up to $1 million or 20 years of imprisonment, or both, for each violation. The AECA also authorizes civil penalties of up to $500,000 and debarment from future exports. Enforcement is carried out by the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) at BIS. OEE's headquarters is in Washington, DC, and the office has 10 offices outside of Washington, DC.",

Several of the affected foreign trading partners responded to the U.S. tariffs with their own retaliatory tariffs targeting various U.S. products, especially agricultural commodities. On July 24, 2018, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would be taking several temporary actions to assist farmers in response to trade damage from what the Administration has characterized as \"unjustified retaliation.\" Specifically, USDA would authorize up to $12 billion in financial assistance\u2014referred to as the \"trade aid\" package\u2014for certain agricultural commodities under Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714c). The Secretary said that most of the funding would go to agricultural commodities most directly affected by the trade retaliation\u2014corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum, wheat, hogs, and dairy (sweet cherries and almonds were added to this list in September)\u2014but that some funding would also be used for the purchase, distribution, and trade promotion of a variety of affected commodities. The trade-aid package includes a Market Facilitation Program (MFP) of direct payments to affected producers, a Food Purchase and Distribution Program, and an Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program. Payments under the MFP program would be made in two rounds: a first round announced on August 27, 2018, initially valued at $4.7 billion; and an equivalent-valued second round announced on December 17, 2018. Secretary Perdue stated that there would not be further trade-related financial assistance beyond this $12 billion package as producers would be able to adjust their production activities in 2019 to reflect market conditions related to the trade dispute.

CBP has authority to enforce APHIS regulations at ports of entry. APHIS and CBP personnel inspect shipments of imported agricultural products and certify that the required animal or plant health import permits and sanitary certificates accompany each shipment. Congress has long been involved in efforts to prevent the entry of pest and disease threats into the United States from agricultural imports. This oversight has manifested in various congressional actions, including continuing to provide APHIS with appropriations to monitor pests and diseases, introducing legislation to address invasive species (e.g., Areawide Integrated Pest Management, H.R. 5411, 115th Congress), and directing CBP to enforce APHIS regulations to deter agricultural smuggling into the United States.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199), which combined six appropriations bills\u2014including the FY2004 District of Columbia Appropriations Act\u2014authorized and appropriated funding for the DC OSP. The DC OSP was established under the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, which was included in P.L. 108-199. Appropriations were initially authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The FY2004 appropriations act provided funding for the DC OSP for the first time and also, for the first time, provided funding for District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) for the improvement of public education, and funding for the District of Columbia State Education Office (SEO) for public charter schools. This approach, commonly known as the \"three-pronged approach\" to funding elementary and secondary education in the District of Columbia, was initially suggested by Mayor Anthony Williams when he asked for federal assistance for public education in the District of Columbia. The proposal was supported by the George W. Bush Administration and many Members of Congress. While concerns were raised during consideration of the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 that only the DC OSP\u2014not school improvement funding for DCPS or public charter schools\u2014was authorized for five years, the federal government has also provided funds to support school improvement in DC public schools and DC public charter schools for each year that the DC OSP has been funded. The DC OSP has been reauthorized twice. It was first reauthorized by the SOAR Act as authorized under Division C of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10). The SOAR Act replaced the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, reauthorized the DC OSP, and authorized appropriations for DC public schools and DC public charter schools for FY2012 through FY2016. The program was subsequently reauthorized by the SOAR Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-31), which amended the SOAR Act and extended the authorization of appropriations for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools through FY2019. Many of the provisions included in the SOAR Act continue to be reflected in current law. Changes to the DC OSP have also been made primarily through appropriations acts in the intervening fiscal years. For FY2019, $52.5 million was appropriated for the SOAR Act, with $17.5 million each provided to the DC OSP, DCPS, and the DC State Education Office. The SOAR Act provides funding for scholarships for students to attend participating private elementary and secondary schools as well as funding for DC public schools and DC public charter schools.

    "crs_R45713": "The First Amendment protects the \"freedom of speech,\" but it does not protect violence. But when speech promotes violence, a tension can form between the values of liberty and security. In an oft-quoted passage from a dissenting opinion, Justice Robert Jackson argued that the problems this tension creates are not insurmountable but must be confronted with a dose of pragmatism: a government can temper \"liberty with order,\" but to treat free speech as absolute threatens to \"convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.\" While Justices of the Court have often disagreed over when free speech rights must yield to the government's interests, when it comes to speech promoting violence, the Court has rejected an all-or-nothing approach. Over the past 50 years, the Court has drawn a line between speech that advocates violence in the abstract and speech that facilitates it in a specific way, with the former receiving more robust constitutional protections. It has done so because, in the Court's view, upholding the First Amendment requires preserving \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\" debate on public issues, even if that means allowing individuals to express ideas that are \"deeply offensive to many.\" In more recent years, some have begun to question whether and how the Court's decisions in this area should apply to speech online. The \"vast democratic fora of the Internet\" have provided ample platforms not only for those seeking to debate issues or express controversial views, but also for individuals and entities planning violent attacks or threatening violence online. Many policymakers and commentators, including some Members of Congress, have expressed concerns about the proliferation of social media content promoting terrorism and violence and the influence such speech can have on other internet users. Some have called on Congress to restrict or even prohibit such content, which raises the question of whether the First Amendment would allow such regulation. A number of legal scholars have explored these issues, and some have proposed recommendations to Congress about how best to address these concerns in accordance with the First Amendment. Although governmental efforts to combat online content promoting terrorism or violence could take a number of forms, this report focuses on the First Amendment implications of imposing civil or criminal liability on individual internet users (i.e., the originators of the content) rather than the social media companies or internet service providers themselves. As such, it focuses on the underlying First Amendment issues that are likely to be common to both forms of government action, but does not discuss the additional considerations attendant to regulating a social media platform, which are the subject of another CRS report. The report begins with some background on the use of the internet by terrorist groups and the reported influence of online content on certain individuals accused of committing violent attacks. It then considers the question of who can invoke the First Amendment by analyzing whether its free speech protections apply to foreign nationals when they post online content from abroad, for example, in circumstances such as U.S. prosecutions where online content is introduced as evidence of a crime. The report then discusses the overarching First Amendment principles that bear on what the government may regulate under the First Amendment, including (1) the distinction between regulating conduct and speech; (2) the presumed invalidity of content-based laws; and (3) relevant \"unprotected\" categories of speech that generally can be restricted because of their content. The report next discusses the strict scrutiny standard and the overbreadth doctrine, which impose limitations on how the government can regulate by requiring that laws restricting speech be sufficiently tailored and not so broad as to chill protected speech. Finally, the report concludes with some considerations for Congress in evaluating the constitutionality of regulating online content promoting terrorism or violence.",

These groups may commonly be described as congressional caucuses, working groups, or task forces, but in this report, will be identified, collectively, as informal Member organizations, to avoid confusion with official party caucuses. An additional distinction between informal Member organizations may be drawn.

CMOs registered with the Committee on House Administration can include groups exclusively for House Members or bicameral groups that include House Members and Senators. Informal Member organizations that are not registered with the Committee on House Administration are called informal Member groups; these include groups exclusive to the Senate, which does not have any formal registration process for informal Member organizations.

The Committee on House Administration lists 518 registered CMOs for the 115th Congress, which includes House-only organizations and some bicameral organizations. The number of informal Member organizations has increased markedly since the 1970s. The number of informal Member organizations increased during the 1970s, and the number of Legislative Service Organizations (LSOs) increased during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. The number of LSOs remained fairly stable, but the number of CMOs increased in the late 1990s. The independence of these groups from more formal institutions within the House and Senate can provide certain advantages, such as facilitating collaboration among Members and providing leadership opportunities outside of one's party or committee assignments. At times, this relative independence has also led to concerns about oversight for informal Member organizations, as well as concerns over the fractionalization of the legislative process and competition with formal leadership and committee functions. Some groups may share legislative or representational interests with the House or Senate at large, certain party leaders, or particular committees; yet Member organizations can also create forums for differing viewpoints, new policy ideas, or more particularized constituent concerns.

    "crs_RL33275": "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under which the federal government gives annual grants to states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and Indian tribal organizations to operate multi-component home energy assistance programs for needy households. Established in 1981 by Title XXVI of P.L. 97-35, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, LIHEAP has been reauthorized and amended a number of times, most recently in 2005, when P.L. 109-58, the Energy Policy Act, authorized annual regular LIHEAP funds at $5.1 billion per year from FY2005 through FY2007. The federal LIHEAP statute has very broad guidelines, with many decisions regarding the program's operation made by the states. Recipients may be helped with their heating and cooling costs, receive crisis assistance, have weatherizing expenses paid, or receive other aid designed to reduce their home energy needs. Households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty income guidelines or, if greater, 60% of the state median income, are federally eligible for LIHEAP benefits. States may adopt lower income limits, but no household with income below 110% of the poverty guidelines may be considered ineligible. The LIHEAP statute provides for two types of program funding: regular funds\u2014sometimes referred to as block grant funds\u2014and emergency contingency funds. Regular funds are allotted to states on the basis of the LIHEAP statutory formula, which was enacted as part of the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-558). The way in which regular funds are allocated to states depends on the amount of funds appropriated by Congress. The second type of LIHEAP funds, emergency contingency funds, last appropriated in FY2011, may be released and allotted to one or more states at the discretion of the President and the Secretary of HHS. The funds may be released at any point in the fiscal year to meet additional home energy assistance needs created by a natural disaster or other emergency. For more information on LIHEAP more generally, see CRS Report RL31865, LIHEAP: Program and Funding, by Libby Perl. The LIHEAP statute provides for three different methods to calculate each state's allotment of regular funds. The calculation method used to determine state allotments depends upon the size of the appropriation in a particular year. If the annual appropriation level is at or below the equivalent of a hypothetical FY1984 appropriation of $1.975 billion, then the \"old\" LIHEAP formula percentages apply. If appropriations exceed a hypothetical FY1984 appropriation of $1.975 billion, then \"new\" formula percentages apply and are used to calculate state allotments. To calculate the new formula percentages, HHS determines the heating and cooling costs of low-income households in each state. If the appropriation is less than $2.25 billion, the new formula percentages are used together with a hold-harmless level that prevents states from falling below the amount they would have received at the hypothetical FY1984 appropriations level. Finally, if appropriations equal or exceed $2.25 billion, the \"new\" formula percentages apply, as does the hold-harmless level, and, in addition, a hold-harmless rate increases the \"new\" formula percentage for certain states. The LIHEAP statute does not contain an explicit trigger for the \"new\" formula rates to be used. However, the statute specifies that states must receive no less than \"the amount of funds the State would have received in fiscal year 1984 if the appropriations for this subchapter for fiscal year 1984 had been $1,975,000,000.\" As a result, up to this appropriation level, states receive the same percentage of funds that they would have received at a given appropriation level under the \"old\" LIHEAP formula. The \"new\" formula percentages that HHS calculates using the most recent satisfactory data available do not necessarily represent the percentage of funds that states will receive under the new formula. Instead, Congress has directed, in appropriations language, that a portion of funds be distributed using the \"new\" formula, and the remainder using the \"old\" formula.

Spence National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398). Currently administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. AFG also supports fire prevention projects and firefighter health and safety research and development through the Firefighter Prevention and Safety (FP&S) grant program, which is funded at not less than 10% of the annual appropriation for AFG. Since its establishment, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program has been reauthorized three times. The first reauthorization was Title XXXVI of the FY2005 Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 108-375), which authorized the program through FY2009. The second reauthorization was Title XVIII, Subtitle A of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 112-239), which authorized the program through FY2017 and modified program rules for disbursing grant money. The third and current reauthorization is the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98), which authorizes the program through FY2023. On January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98). P.L. 115-98 extends the AFG and SAFER authorizations through FY2023; extends the sunset provisions for AFG and SAFER through September 30, 2024; extends the USFA authorization through FY2023; provides that the U.S. Fire Administration in FEMA may develop and make widely available an online training course on AFG and SAFER grant administration; expands SAFER hiring grant eligibility to cover the conversion of part-time or paid-on-call firefighters to full-time firefighters; directs FEMA, acting through the Administrator of USFA, to develop and implement a grant monitoring and oversight framework to mitigate and minimize risks of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement related to the AFG and SAFER grant programs; and makes various technical corrections to the AFG and SAFER statute.",
    "crs_R44736": "Congressional rules establish a general division of responsibility under which questions of policy are kept separate from questions of funding. Broadly, the term authorization is used to describe legislation that establishes, continues, or modifies the organization or activities of a federal entity or program. By itself, such legislation does not provide funding for such purposes. Instead, the authority to obligate payments from the Treasury is left to separate appropriations measures. This distinction between appropriations and general legislation as two separate classes of measures, and their consideration in separate legislative vehicles, is a construct of congressional rules and practices. It has been developed and formalized by the House and Senate pursuant to the constitutional authority for each chamber to \"determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\" This power permits each chamber of Congress to enforce, modify, waive, repeal, or ignore its rules as it sees fit. Because the two chambers exercise this rulemaking authority independently, they have developed differing (albeit generally similar) rules and practices.

    "crs_RS21534": "The Al Said monarchy began in 1744, extending Omani influence into Zanzibar and other parts of East Africa until 1861. Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id Al Said, born in November 1940, is the eighth in the line of the monarchy; he became sultan in July 1970 when, with British support, he forced his father, Sultan Said bin Taymur Al Said, to abdicate. The United States has had relations with Oman from the early days since American independence. The United States signed a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Oman in 1833, one of the first of its kind with an Arab state. Oman sent an official envoy to the United States in 1840. A U.S. consulate was maintained in Muscat during 1880-1915, a U.S. embassy was opened in 1972, and the first resident U.S. Ambassador arrived in July 1974. Oman opened its embassy in Washington, DC, in 1973. Career diplomat Marc Sievers has been Ambassador to Oman since late 2015. Oman remains a monarchy in which decisionmaking still is concentrated with Sultan Qaboos. Throughout his reign, Qaboos has also formally held the position of Prime Minister, as well as the positions of Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, Finance Minister, and Central Bank Governor. Other officials serve as \"Ministers of State\" for those portfolios and serve de-facto as ministers. Qaboos's government, and Omani society, reflects the diverse backgrounds of the Omani population, many of whom have long-standing family connections to parts of East Africa that Oman once controlled, and to the Indian subcontinent. Some senior Omanis argue that a formal position of Prime Minister is needed to organize the functions of the government and enable the Sultan to focus on larger strategic decisions. Should such a post be established, potential candidates include the deputy prime minister for cabinet affairs, Fahd bin Mahmud Al Said (who Omanis already widely refer to as \"Prime Minister\"); the secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi; Salim bin Nasir al-Ismaily, a businessman and economic adviser to the Sultan who reportedly brokered 2013 U.S.-Iran meetings; and Royal Office head General Sultan bin Mohammad al-Naamani. Along with political reform issues, the question of succession has long been central to observers of Oman. Sultan Qaboos's brief marriage in the 1970s produced no children, and the sultan, who was born in November 1940, has no heir apparent. According to Omani officials, succession would be decided by a \"Ruling Family Council\" of his relatively small Al Said family (about 50 male members). If the family council cannot reach agreement within three days, it is to select the successor recommended by Qaboos in a sealed letter to be opened upon his death; there are no confirmed accounts of whom Qaboos has recommended. The succession issue has come to the fore since he underwent cancer treatment in Germany during 2014-15. Since returning to Oman, he has appeared in public only on major occasions or to meet visiting foreign leaders.

    "crs_RL34544": "Iran has a nuclear program that began during the 1950s. Construction of a U.S.-supplied research reactor, called the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), began in 1960; the reactor went critical in 1967. During the 1970s, Tehran pursued an ambitious nuclear power program. According to contemporaneous U.S. documents, Iran wanted to construct 10-20 nuclear power reactors and produce more than 20,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 1994. Iran also began constructing a light-water nuclear power reactor near the city of Bushehr, and it considered obtaining uranium enrichment and reprocessing technology. Iran has begun to operate the Bushehr reactor, and Tehran says it intends to build additional reactors to generate 20,000 megawatts of power within the next 20 years. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) requires Iran to refrain from building heavy-water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Pursuant to the agreement, Iran has pledged to refrain from constructing any such reactors indefinitely. Iranian officials have asserted that the country can rapidly reconstitute its fissile material production capability, although Tehran has adhered to the JCPOA-specified limits. Iran claims that it wants to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU), which can be used in nuclear power reactors, as well as the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) and other planned future research reactors. The latter reactors will be used to produce isotopes for medical purposes, according to Tehran. Although Iran has expressed interest in purchasing nuclear fuel from other countries, the government asserts that the country should have an indigenous enrichment capability as a hedge against possible fuel supply disruptions. President Hassan Rouhani ordered the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) President Salehi on December 13, 2016, to provide a plan \"for designing and manufacturing nuclear-propulsion system to be used in maritime transportation,\" as well as producing fuel for such a system. However, Iranian officials have indicated that Tehran would not produce enriched uranium exceeding JCPOA-established enrichment limits. In a January 2018 letter, Iran informed the IAEA of the government's \"decision... to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future.\" Tehran explained in an April 2018 letter to the agency that \"[f]or the first five years, no [nuclear] facility will be involved\" and the \"[n]uclear fuelled engines/reactors will be used for civilian purpose.\" Salehi stated in early February 2019 that at the project will take \"at least 15 years\" to complete. A reactor moderated by heavy water, which Iran was constructing at Arak, has also been a source of concern. Although Tehran says that the reactor is intended for the production of radioisotopes for medical purposes, the reactor previously under construction was a proliferation concern because its spent fuel would have contained plutonium well-suited for use in nuclear weapons. Spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors contains plutonium, the other type of fissile material used in nuclear weapons. In order to be used in nuclear weapons, however, plutonium must be separated from the spent fuel\u2014a procedure called \"reprocessing.\" Iran has said that it will not engage in reprocessing. This reactor is designed to use natural uranium fuel, which does not require enrichment. Iran has rendered the Arak reactor's original core inoperable pursuant to the JCPOA, which also commits Tehran to redesign and rebuild the reactor based on a design agreed to by the P5+1. Iran has also a uranium-conversion facility, which converts uranium ore concentrate into several compounds, including uranium hexafluoride. This program is currently constrained by the JCPOA. The JCPOA requires Iran to refrain from building heavy-water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Pursuant to the agreement, Iran has pledged to refrain from constructing any such reactors indefinitely. Iranian officials say that Tehran has begun design work on its first indigenously produced light-water reactor, to be constructed at Darkhovin. According to official U.S. and Iranian sources, France agreed to construct the reactor during the 1970s but ended the project after the 1979 revolution in Iran. A reactor moderated by heavy water, which Iran was constructing at Arak, has also been a source of concern.

    "crs_RL34273": "The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, more than a quarter of the land in the United States. These lands are heavily concentrated in 12 western states (including Alaska), where the federal government owns roughly half of the overall land area. Four federal agencies\u2014the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture\u2014administer about 95% of those lands. No single law provides authority for these four agencies to acquire and/or dispose of lands. Rather, Congress provided various acquisition and disposal authorities through laws enacted over more than a century. This report describes the primary authorities of the four agencies. The extent to which each of the agencies has authority to acquire and dispose of land, and the nature of the authorities, varies considerably. Some of the agencies have relatively broad authority to acquire and/or dispose of land. Most notably, the BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals. By contrast, the NPS has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The extent of the acquisition and disposal authorities for the FS and the FWS are not nearly as broad as the BLM's but not nearly as restrictive as the NPS's. The FS authority to acquire lands is mostly limited to lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest. The agency has various authorities to dispose of land, but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used. The FWS has various authorities to acquire lands but no general authority to dispose of its lands. The suitability of the acquisition and disposal authorities, and the extent and circumstances of their use by the agencies, forms the backdrop for congressional consideration of measures to establish, modify, or eliminate the use of authorities. With regard to the establishment of new authorities, some 115th Congress proposals would authorize states to exchange land grant parcels for federal lands. Other measures would authorize the BLM and FS to convey small tracts to adjacent landowners and to govern the use of proceeds from these conveyances. Proposals to modify authorities include measures in the 115th Congress to reauthorize and amend BLM authority to sell or exchange land under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA; 43 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), as well as bills to amend the Small Tracts Act (16 U.S.C. 521e) regarding the type and value of FS lands that can be disposed of and the use of related proceeds.

    "crs_R45633": "Iraqis are working to open a new chapter in their country's development and are debating the future of their relationship with the United States. The Iraqi government declared military victory against the Islamic State organization in December 2017, but insurgent attacks by remaining IS fighters continue to threaten Iraqis in some areas. Iraq's security forces are rebuilding after years of intense fighting. Notwithstanding significant U.S. and international assistance, Iraq's security forces still lack some operational, intelligence, logistical, and management capabilities needed to protect their country. More than 4 million internally displaced Iraqis have returned home, but extensive stabilization and reconstruction are needed in liberated areas. An estimated 1.7 million Iraqis remain as internally displaced persons (IDPs), and Iraqi authorities have identified $88 billion in reconstruction needs over the next decade. U.S. and other foreign troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and provide advisory and training support to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), including peshmerga forces associated with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). However, some Iraqi political groups\u2014including some with ties to Iran\u2014are pushing for U.S. and other foreign troops to depart; they may force formal consideration of a resolution to that effect in the Iraqi parliament. Such a resolution would likely be nonbinding (if adopted), but nevertheless could create significant political and diplomatic complications for U.S. and Iraqi leaders, and might prompt more fundamental policy reconsiderations on both sides. The Iranian government has viewed instability in neighboring Iraq as a threat and an opportunity since 2003, and works to influence the security sector decisions of Iraqi leaders. It also maintains ties to some armed groups in Iraq, including some units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)\u2014volunteer militias recruited to fight the Islamic State. The PMF have been recognized as an enduring component of Iraq's national security establishment pursuant to a 2016 law that calls for their integration under existing command structures and administration. U.S. officials have recognized the contributions that PMF volunteers have made to Iraq's fight against the Islamic State; they also remain wary of the potential for Iran-linked elements of the PMF to evolve into permanent proxy forces, whether they remain tied to the Iraqi state or work outside formal Iraqi government and military control. U.S. policy seeks to support the long-term development of Iraq's military, counterterrorism, and police services as alternatives to the continued use of PMF units to secure Iraq's borders, communities, and territory recaptured from the Islamic State. U.S. concerns about Iranian government policies have intensified in recent years, and Iraq has become a venue for U.S.-Iranian competition. Iran's government supported insurgent attacks on U.S. forces during the U.S. presence from 2003 to 2011. Since then, U.S.-Iranian competition has remained contained and nonviolent, but there is no certainty it will remain so, as demonstrated by indirect fire attacks in 2018 on U.S. diplomatic facilities, attacks attributed by U.S. officials to Iranian proxy groups. Iraqi leaders are trying to prevent their country from being used as a battleground for regional and international rivalries and seek to build positive, nonexclusive ties to their neighbors and global powers. Broad U.S. efforts to put pressure on Iran extend to the Iraqi energy sector, where years of sanctions, conflict, neglect, and mismanagement have left Iraq dependent on purchases of natural gas and electricity from its Iranian neighbors. Since 2018, Iraqi leaders have sought relief from U.S. sanctions on related transactions with Iran. The Trump Administration has sustained a cooperative relationship with the Iraqi government and has requested funding for FY2020 to support Iraq's stabilization and continue security training for Iraqi security forces. The size and mission of the U.S. military presence in Iraq have evolved as conditions on the ground have changed since 2017; they could change further if Iraqi officials revise their current requests for continued U.S. and international security assistance. The 116th Congress has appropriated funds to provide security assistance, humanitarian relief, and foreign aid for Iraq (P.L. 116-6), and is considering appropriations and authorization requests for FY2020 that would largely continue U.S. policies and programs on current terms. It remains to be seen whether Iraq and the United States will be able to pursue opportunities to build a bilateral relationship that is less defined by conflict and its aftermath. To do so, leaders on both sides will likely have to continue creatively managing unusually complex political and security challenges.",

Mandatory spending for the title over 10 years (FY2019-FY2028) is projected by CBO to be reduced by $6 billion, relative to the 2014 farm bill authorized levels.

    "crs_R45525": "The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-34), known as the \"2018 farm bill,\" was enacted on December 20, 2018, approximately eight months after the bill was introduced. In the House, the Agriculture Committee reported the bill on April 18, 2018, by a vote of 26-20. An initial floor vote on May 18, 2018, failed in the House by a vote of 198-213, but floor procedures allowed that vote to be reconsidered (H.Res. 905). The House passed H.R. 2 in a second vote of 213-211 on June 21, 2018. In the Senate, the Agriculture Committee reported its bill (S. 3042) on June 13, 2018, by a vote of 20-1. The Senate passed its bill as an amendment to H.R. 2 by a vote of 86-11 on June 28, 2018. Conference proceedings to resolve the differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2 officially began on September 5, 2018, and concluded in December 2018 with Senate passage of H.R. 2 on a vote of 87-13 and House passage by a vote of 369-47 (H.Rept. 115-1072). The enacted 2018 farm bill continues a tradition of multi-year farm bills that would establish policy for a broad array of agriculture and nutrition assistance programs. To this end, P.L. 115-334 addresses agriculture and food policy across 12 titles. These titles cover commodity support programs, agricultural conservation, trade and international food aid, domestic nutrition assistance, credit, rural development, research and extension, forestry, horticulture, crop insurance, and a variety of other policies and initiatives. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected at enactment that outlays of the 2018 farm bill will amount to $428 billion over the five-year life of the law (FY2019-FY2023). Most of this projected spending\u2014$326 million, or 76%\u2014is in the nutrition title for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining 24%\u2014$102 billion of projected outlays\u2014stems primarily from agricultural programs, including crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. CBO estimated that the conference agreement for the 2018 farm bill will be budget neutral over a 10-year period (FY2019-FY2028). CBO estimated that in its first five years, the enacted 2018 farm bill will increase spending by $1.8 billion, compared with a simple extension of the 2014 farm bill, but that this initial increase will be entirely offset in the second five years of the budget window. The \"Budgetary Impact\" section of this report provides additional detail at the level of individual titles and major programs. The policymaking environment for the 2018 farm bill differed materially from that of the 2014 farm bill, reflecting lower farm income levels in recent years and disruptions to agricultural exports beginning in 2018. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts that for 2018, net cash farm income\u2014a measure of the profitability of farming\u2014will be about one-third below the levels of 2012 and 2013, which were the highest in the last 40 years adjusted for inflation. The decline in farm income, coupled with uncertainty about prospects for agricultural exports, may well have played a role in shaping a set of policies in the enacted farm bill that provide farmers and ranchers with a degree of continuity for the next five years. This report provides an analysis of the budgetary implications of both bills, followed by summaries identifying some of the changes contained in the enacted 2018 farm bill compared with prior law. These summaries are followed by tables containing a title-by-title analysis of all of the policies and provisions in the enacted 2018 farm bill compared to the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2 and with the expired 2014 farm bill.",
    "crs_RL31055": "One of the most common methods for redistributing spending priorities in appropriations bills on the House floor is through offset amendments. House offset amendments generally change spending priorities in a pending appropriations measure by increasing spending for certain activities (or creating spending for new activities not previously included in the bill) and offsetting the increase(s) by decreasing or striking funding for other activities in the bill. For example, an amendment increasing funding for one agency funded in the bill by $3 million and decreasing funding for another agency by the same amount in the same bill would be an offset amendment. These amendments may transfer funds between two activities or among several activities. In addition, certain offset amendments may reduce funding with across-the-board spending reductions. Representatives use offset amendments for a variety of reasons, including to (1) ensure that proposals increasing funding for certain activities in any appropriations measure do not violate parliamentary rules enforcing certain spending ceilings; (2) comply with the prohibition against increasing total spending in a general appropriations bill; (3) garner support for efforts to reduce funding for certain activities by transferring those funds to popular programs; and (4) provide a focal point for discussion of a particular issue. This report is an introduction to selected House rules and practices governing the consideration of offset amendments to appropriations measures considered in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union (or Committee of the Whole). It analyzes the parliamentary context providing the need for offset amendments; the two types of offset amendments, clause 2(f) and reachback (or fetchback) offset amendments, including procedural factors regarding each; and the mechanisms for waiving House rules. The report concludes with highlights on the procedural advantages of each offset amendment type. This report is not an official statement of House procedures. The House Parliamentarian advises the presiding officer on procedural issues regarding offset amendments and other matters. Although this report provides useful background information, it should not be considered a substitute for consultation with the Parliamentarian on specific procedural problems and opportunities.",

The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, \"without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms (except when filling an unexpired term). The President designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairperson. Three commissioners may be members of the same political party as the President and none can have a financial interest in any commission-related business. The FCC is funded through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill as a single line item. Previously, it was funded through what is now the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, also as a single line item. The FCC annually collects and retains regulatory fees to offset costs incurred by the agency and to carry out its functions. Since 2009 the FCC's budget has been derived from regulatory fees collected by the agency rather than through a direct appropriation. The fees, often referred to as \"Section (9) fees,\" are collected from license holders and certain other entities (e.g., cable television systems). The regulatory fees do not apply to governmental entities, amateur radio operator licensees, nonprofit entities, and certain other non-commercial entities.

First, largely through committee investigations and hearings, the confirmation process allows the Senate to examine the qualifications of nominees and any potential conflicts of interest. Second, Senators can influence policy through the confirmation process, either by rejecting nominees or by extracting promises from nominees before granting consent. Also, the Senate sometimes has delayed the confirmation process in order to increase its influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters.

Second, Senators can influence policy through the confirmation process, either by rejecting nominees or by extracting promises from nominees before granting consent. Also, the Senate sometimes has delayed the confirmation process in order to increase its influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters. The confirmation process is required for several categories of government officials. Military appointments and promotions make up the majority of nominations, approximately 65,000 per two-year Congress, and most are confirmed routinely. Each Congress, the Senate also considers approximately 2,000 civilian nominations, and, again, many of them, such as appointments to or promotions in the Foreign Service, are routine. Civilian nominations considered by the Senate also include federal judges and specified officers in executive departments, independent agencies, and regulatory boards and commissions. Many presidential appointees are confirmed routinely by the Senate. With tens of thousands of nominations each Congress, the Senate cannot possibly consider them all in detail. A regularized process facilitates quick action on thousands of government positions. The Senate may approve en bloc hundreds of nominations at a time, especially military appointments and promotions. The process also allows for close scrutiny of candidates when necessary. Each year, a few hundred nominees to high-level positions are regularly subject to Senate investigations and public hearings. Most of these are routinely approved, while a small number of nominations are disputed and receive more attention from the media and Congress. Judicial nominations, particularly Supreme Court appointees, are generally subject to greater scrutiny than nominations to executive posts, partly because judges may serve for life. Among the executive branch positions, nominees for policymaking positions are more likely to be examined closely, and are slightly less likely to be confirmed, than nominees for non-policy positions. The confirmation process is governed by Senate rules and precedents. Most Senate committees that consider nominations have written rules concerning the process. Although committee rules vary, most contain standards concerning information to be gathered from a nominee. Many committees expect a biographical resum\u00e9 and some kind of financial statement listing assets and liabilities. Some specify the terms under which financial statements will or will not be made public. Committee rules also frequently contain timetables outlining the minimum layover required between committee actions. A common timing provision is a requirement that nominations be held for one or two weeks before the committee proceeds to a hearing or a vote, permitting Senators time to review a nomination before committee consideration. Other committee rules specifically mandate a delay between steps of the process, such as the receipt of pre-hearing information and the date of the hearing, or the distribution of hearing transcripts and the committee vote on the nomination. Some of the written rules also contain provisions for the rules to be waived by majority vote, by unanimous consent, or by the chair and the ranking minority Member. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee, regardless of whether they were reported favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Usually, the majority leader schedules the consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nomination",
    "crs_R45653": "When Congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information, or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is considered inappropriate or unavailing, a subpoena\u2014either for testimony or documents\u2014may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands. An individual\u2014whether a member of the public or an executive branch official\u2014has a legal obligation to comply with a duly issued and valid congressional subpoena, unless a valid and overriding privilege or other legal justification permits non-compliance. The subpoena, however, is only as effective as the means by which it is potentially enforced. Without a process by which Congress can coerce compliance or deter non-compliance, the subpoena would be reduced to a formalized request rather than a constitutionally based demand for information. Congress currently employs an ad hoc combination of methods to combat non-compliance with subpoenas. The two predominant methods rely on the authority and participation of another branch of government. First, the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena. Once the contempt citation is received, any later prosecution lies within the control of the executive branch. Second, Congress may try to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring that the recipient is legally obligated to comply. This process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands. Congress has only rarely resorted to either criminal contempt or civil enforcement to combat non-compliance with subpoenas. In most circumstances involving the executive branch, committees can obtain the information they seek through voluntary requests or after issuing (but not yet seeking enforcement of) a subpoena. Even where the executive branch is initially reluctant to provide information, Congress can use the application of various forms of legislative leverage, along with an informal political process of negotiation and accommodation, to obtain what it needs. Congress exercises substantial power over the executive branch by controlling agency authority, funding, and, in the case of the Senate, confirmation of executive officers. The use or threatened use of these powers in a way that would impose burdens on an agency can encourage compliance with subpoenas (or make it more likely that requested information will be provided without need to issue a subpoena) and solidify Congress's position when trying to negotiate a compromise during an investigative dispute with the executive branch. But legislative leverage and the subpoena enforcement mechanisms do not always ensure congressional access to requested information, particularly from the executive branch. Recent controversies could be interpreted to suggest that the existing mechanisms are at times inadequate\u2014at least in the relatively rare instance that enforcement is necessary to respond to a current or former executive branch official who has refused to comply with a subpoena. Four times since 2008, the House of Representatives has held an executive branch official (or former official) in criminal contempt of Congress for denying a committee information subpoenaed during an ongoing investigation. In each instance the executive branch determined not to bring the matter before a grand jury. In three of the four instances, the House also looked to the federal courts for civil enforcement of the outstanding subpoena. The committees involved eventually obtained much of the information sought through those lawsuits, but only after prolonged litigation, and, in one of the cases, only after a judicial decision that could be viewed as potentially hindering Congress's access to executive branch information in the future. The House's decision to resort to criminal contempt of Congress and civil enforcement in these cases was not without controversy, as in each instance the executive official asserted that a constitutional privilege limited Congress's right to the information sought. This report will not address whether the officials in each case invoked a valid privilege or whether the privilege asserted was adequate to justify withholding information from Congress. Nor will this report address whether, under the circumstances, it was appropriate for Congress to exercise its contempt power. Rather, this report will examine the legal enforcement of congressional subpoenas in a contemporary and historical context and discuss legal issues associated with alternative subpoena-enforcement frameworks that Congress may consider to obtain information from the executive branch.",
    "crs_98-35": "The Social Security benefit formula is weighted to replace a greater share of career-average earnings for low-paid workers than for high-paid workers. This means that low-paid workers receive relatively high benefits in relation to their payroll tax contributions, although the dollar amount of their benefits is lower than that provided to high-paid workers. The benefit formula, however, cannot distinguish between workers who have low career-average earnings because they worked for many years at low earnings in Social Security-covered employment and workers who appear to have low career-average earnings because they worked for many years in jobs not covered by Social Security. (Those years show up as zeros in their Social Security earnings records, which, when averaged, lower their career earnings from covered work.) Consequently, workers who split their careers between covered and noncovered employment\u2014even highly paid ones\u2014may also receive the advantage of the weighted formula. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula designed to remove the unintended advantage, or \"windfall,\" of the regular benefit formula for certain retired or disabled workers who spent less than full careers in covered employment and who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs not covered by Social Security. The reduction in initial benefits caused by the WEP is designed to place affected workers in approximately the same position they would have been in had all their earnings been covered by Social Security. The WEP was enacted in 1983 as part of major amendments (P.L. 98-21) designed to shore up the financing of the Social Security program. The purpose of the 1983 provision was to remove an unintended advantage that the regular benefit formula provided to certain retired or disabled worker-beneficiaries who were also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs not covered by Social Security. The regular formula was intended to help workers who spent their lifetimes in low-paying jobs, by providing them with a benefit that replaces a higher proportion of their career-average earnings than the benefit provided to workers with high career-average earnings. However, the formula does not differentiate between those who worked in low-paid jobs throughout their careers and other workers who appear to have been low paid because they worked for many years in jobs not covered by Social Security. Under the old law, workers who were employed for only a portion of their careers in jobs covered by Social Security\u2014even highly paid ones\u2014also received the advantage of the weighted formula, because their few years of covered earnings were averaged over their entire working career to determine the average covered earnings on which their Social Security benefits were based. The WEP is intended to place affected workers in approximately the same position they would have been in had all their earnings been covered by Social Security.

    "crs_R45518": "The 2007-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy. Many assert only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse. Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis. In addition, many argue the crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory regime governing the financial system had serious weaknesses. Policymakers responded to the perceived weaknesses in the pre-crisis financial regulatory regime by implementing numerous changes to financial regulation, including to bank regulation. Most notably, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks. In addition, U.S. bank regulators have implemented changes under their existing authorities, many of which generally adhere to the Basel III Accords\u2014an international framework for bank regulation agreed to by U.S. and international bank regulators\u2014that called for making certain bank regulations more stringent. In the ensuing years, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth). In response to these concerns, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act; P.L. 115-174). Among other things, the law modified certain (1) regulations facing small banks; (2) regulations facing banks large enough to be subjected to Dodd-Frank enhanced regulation but still below the size thresholds exceeded by the very largest banks; and (3) mortgage regulations facing lenders including banks. In addition, federal banking regulatory agencies\u2014the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\u2014have proposed further changes in regulation. Implementing the regulatory changes prescribed in the aftermath of the crisis and made pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act occurred over the course of years. In recent years\u2014a period in which the leadership of the regulators has transferred from Obama Administration to Trump Administration appointees\u2014the banking regulators have expressed the belief that, after having viewed the effects of the regulations, they now have the necessary information to determine which regulations may be ineffective or inefficient as currently implemented. Recently, these regulators have made of number of proposals with the aim of reducing regulatory burden. A key issue surrounding regulatory relief made pursuant to the EGRRCP Act and regulator-initiated changes is whether regulatory burden can be reduced without undermining the goals and effectiveness of the regulations. Meanwhile, market trends and economic conditions continue to affect the banking industry. Some of the more notable conditions include the development of new technologies used in financial services (known as \"fintech\") and a rising interest rate environment following an extraordinarily long period of very low rates. This report provides a broad overview of selected banking-related issues, including issues related to \"safety and soundness\" regulation, consumer protection, community banks, large banks, what type of companies should be able to establish banks, and recent market and economic trends. This report is not an exhaustive look at all bank policy issues, nor is it a detailed examination of any one issue. Rather, it provides concise background and analyses of certain prominent issues that have been the subject of recent discussion and debate.

    "crs_R44383": "Persistent annual budget deficits and a large and increasing federal debt have generated discussions over the long-term sustainability of current budget projections. Federal budget deficits declined from 9.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2009 to 3.8% of GDP in FY2018. However, recent estimates forecast that the government will run deficits (i.e., federal expenditures will exceed revenues) in every year through FY2029. Federal debt totaled $21.516 trillion at the end of FY2018, and as a percentage of GDP (106.0%) was at its highest value since FY1947; $15.761 trillion of that debt (or 77.8% of GDP) was held by the public. This report explores distinctions in the concept and composition of deficits and debt and explains how they interact with economic conditions and other aspects of fiscal policy. The federal government incurs a deficit (also known as a net deficit) when its total outgoing payments (outlays) exceed the total money it collects (revenues). If instead federal revenues are greater than outlays, then the federal government generates a surplus. A balanced budget describes the case where federal receipts equal federal expenditures. The size of a deficit or surplus is equal to the difference between the levels of spending and receipts. Deficits are measured over the course of a defined period of time\u2014in the case of the federal government, a fiscal year. Federal budget outcomes incorporate both \"on-budget\" activities, which represent the majority of federal taxes and spending, and \"off-budget\" government activities, which include revenues and outlays from Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service. For federal credit programs, the subsidy cost of government activities is included in deficit and surplus calculations. The federal budget is constructed in a manner that provides for lower net deficits in more robust economic conditions, attributable to higher revenues (from taxes on increased output) and, to a smaller degree, lower spending levels (from reduced demand for programs like unemployment insurance). The federal government incurred a deficit of $779 billion in FY2018, equivalent to 3.8% of GDP. From FY1969 to FY2018, the average net deficit equaled 2.9% of annual GDP ($587 billion in 2018 dollars). Over the FY1969-FY2018 period, the government generated a surplus on five occasions: in FY1969 and in each year from FY1998 through FY2001. In all other years, the federal government incurred a net deficit. The federal debt is the money that the government owes to its creditors, which include private citizens, institutions, foreign governments, and other parts of the federal government. Debt measurements may be taken at any time and represent the accumulation of all previous government borrowing activity. Federal debt increases when there are net budget deficits, outflows made for federal credit programs (net of the subsidy costs already included in deficit calculations), and increases in intragovernmental borrowing. Federal credit programs include loans issued for college tuition payments, small business programs, and other activities the government may seek to support. In those cases, debt levels increase as additional loans are granted and decrease as money for such programs is repaid. Intragovernmental debt is generated when trust funds, revolving funds, and special funds receive money from tax payments, fees, or other revenue sources that is not immediately needed to make payments. In those cases the surpluses are used to finance other government activities, and Government Account Series (GAS) securities are issued to the trust fund. Intragovernmental debt may be thought of as money that one part of the government owes another part. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for managing federal debt. The primary objective of Treasury's debt management strategy is to fulfill the government's borrowing needs at the lowest cost over time. Treasury finances federal borrowing activities by issuing government-backed securities that generate interest payments for their owners. Treasury securities are typically sold to the public through an auction process, and have maturity periods (the length of time that they are held before repayment) of anywhere from several weeks to 30 years. The federal debt is the money that the government owes to its creditors, which include private citizens, institutions, foreign governments, and other parts of the federal government.

    "crs_R42647": "The program activities of most federal agencies are generally funded on an annual basis through the enactment of 12 regular appropriations acts. When those annual appropriations acts are not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year (i.e., by October 1), one or more continuing appropriations acts may be enacted to provide temporary funding to continue certain programs and activities until action on regular appropriations acts is completed. Such funding is provided for a specified period of time, which may be extended through the enactment of subsequent CRs. A continuing appropriations act is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution or CR because it has typically been in the form of a joint resolution rather than a bill. But there is no procedural requirement as to its form. Continuing appropriations are also occasionally provided through a bill. If appropriations are not enacted for a fiscal year through a regular appropriations act or a CR, a \"funding gap\" occurs until such appropriations are provided. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies may be directed to begin a \"shutdown\" of the affected programs and activities. Agencies are generally prohibited from obligating or expending federal funds in the absence of appropriations. Congress has enacted one or more CRs in all but three of the 43 fiscal years since FY1977. In total, 186 CRs were enacted into law during the period covering FY1977-FY2019, ranging from zero to 21 in any single fiscal year. On average, about four CRs were enacted each fiscal year during this interval. This report provides an overview of the components of CRs and information about congressional practices related to their use. The first section of this report explains six of the typical main components of CRs: coverage, duration, funding rate, restrictions on new activities, anomalies, and legislative provisions. The second section discusses the enactment of regular appropriations acts prior to the start of the fiscal year and the number of CRs enacted, beginning with FY1977, which was the first fiscal year that began on October 1. The third section provides information on the variation in the number and duration of CRs enacted each fiscal year after FY1997\u2014the most recent fiscal year in which all regular appropriations were enacted before the start of the new fiscal year.

    "crs_R43661": "The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA; P.L. 95-128) was enacted to \"re-affirm the obligation of federally chartered or insured financial institutions to serve the convenience and needs of their service areas\" and \"to help meet the credit needs of the localities in which they are chartered, consistent with the prudent operation of the institution.\" The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities\u2014such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas and entities\u2014that occur within assessment areas (where institutions have local deposit-taking operations). These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating from a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). The CRA requires federal banking regulators to take those ratings into account when institutions apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions, or seek to take other actions that require regulatory approval. The CRA's impact on lending activity has been publicly debated. Some observers are concerned that the CRA may induce banks to forgo more profitable lending opportunities in nontargeted neighborhoods by encouraging a disproportionate amount of lending in LMI communities. Furthermore, some argue that the CRA compels banks to make loans to higher-risk borrowers that are more likely to have repayment problems, which may subsequently compromise the financial stability of the banking system. For example, some researchers have attributed the increase in risky lending prior to the 2007-2009 recession to banks attempting to comply with CRA objectives. Others are concerned that enforcement of CRA objectives has not been stringent enough to compel banks to increase financial services in LMI areas. Almost all banks receive Satisfactory or better performance ratings on their CRA examinations, which some may consider indicative of weak enforcement. The CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that CRA compliance does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. Without explicit benchmarks, linking the composition of banks' loan portfolios to either too strong or too weak CRA enforcement is difficult. Banks are also unlikely to get CRA credit for all of the loans they make to LMI customers. Specifically, higher-risk loans that banking regulators explicitly discourage are unlikely to be eligible for CRA consideration. Furthermore, greater mobility of lending and deposit-taking activity across regional boundaries due to various financial market innovations has complicated the ability to geographically link various financial activities. Hence, many banks' financial activities occurring in a designated assessment area that are eligible for CRA consideration may simply be profitable, meaning they may have occurred without the CRA incentive. Finally, this report summarizes recent policy discussions regarding modernization of the CRA.",
    "crs_R45665": "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 invests the federal government with a uniquely powerful role in addressing race and national origin discrimination. Like other statutory provisions in the Civil Rights Act, Title VI seeks to end race discrimination among institutions and programs whose doors were otherwise open to the public\u2014especially public schools. But unlike the Civil Rights Act's better known and more heavily litigated provisions, Title VI is concerned specifically with the use of \"public funds,\" designed to ensure that federal dollars not be \"spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination.\" And to fulfill that broad mandate, Title VI takes a distinctive approach to policing discrimination by making the promise of nondiscrimination a condition of the federal government's financial support. Title VI consequently prohibits all federally funded programs, activities, and institutions from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. Although that prohibition accompanies nearly all grants and contracts awarded by the federal government, much of Title VI's doctrine has been shaped by its use in the public schools. That doctrinal story has accordingly centered on one agency in particular: the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the U.S. Department of Education (ED).

    "crs_R45693": "The federal government subsidizes a wide range of activities through the tax code. The majority of available tax incentives are claimed directly by the party engaged in the activity targeted by the subsidy. There are several tax credits, however, that often require or encourage the intended beneficiary of the subsidy to partner with a third party to use the tax incentive. This may happen because the tax credits are nonrefundable and the intended beneficiary of the tax credit has little or no tax liability (e.g., a nonprofit), or because the credits are delivered over multiple years whereas upfront funding is needed to break g round. This situation often results in a tax equity transaction\u2014the intended beneficiary of the tax credit agrees to transfer the rights to claim the credits to a third party in exchange for an equity financing contribution. One estimate placed the size of the tax equity market in 2017 at $20 billion. Tax equity investment is not a statutorily defined term, but rather identifies transactions that pair the tax credits or other tax benefits generated by a qualifying physical investment with the capital financing associated with that investment. These transactions involve one party agreeing to assign the rights to claim the tax credits to another party in exchange for an equity investment (i.e., cash financing). The exchange is sometimes referred to as \"monetizing,\" \"selling,\" or \"trading\" the tax credits. Importantly, however, the \"sale\" of federal tax credits occurs within a partnership or contractual agreement that legally binds the two parties to satisfy federal tax requirements that the tax credit claimant have an ownership interest in the underlying physical investment. This makes the trading of tax credits different than the trading of corporate stock, which occurs between two unrelated parties on an exchange. The partnership form also allows for income (or losses), deductions, and other tax items to be allocated directly to the individual partners. In some cases, nonprofit entities can form a partnership with taxable investors and benefit from tax credits through this relationship. The tax equity approach can create fluctuations in the amount of subsidy qualified activities receive. The subsidy flowing into a project depends on the price tax equity investors receive in exchange for their financing contributions. All else equal, higher tax credit prices imply more federal subsidization of the targeted activity per dollar loss of federal tax revenue. Therefore, factors that cause variability in tax credit prices also cause variability in the subsidization rate. This can lead to fluctuation in the subsidy delivered via the tax equity mechanism, even though there has been no direct policy change regarding the tax credit program itself. For example, during the Great Recession, falling corporate tax liabilities reduced investor demand for credits, leading to depressed credit prices. In turn, qualified investments had difficulty raising enough equity to finance projects. To bypass the tax equity mechanism, some credits were temporarily converted into direct grants. Policies enacted by Congress, but not directly related to the underlying tax credit program itself, can also lead to subsidy fluctuations. This occurred most recently with the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97). Although some direct changes were made to several incentives that use the tax equity mechanism, there have also been concerns that the reduction in corporate tax rates and overall corporate tax liabilities could curb investor appetite for credits, and reduce the amount of tax equity investment being offered in the market. With less tax equity being supplied in the market, tax equity investors might demand higher rates of return, which could increase the cost of financing from the perspective of investors in targeted activities. Additionally, the subsidies delivered by the LIHTC and NMTC can also vary geographically due to the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act (CRA; P.L. 95-128). Policies can also affect the demand for tax equity. For example, with renewable energy tax incentives phasing down, renewable energy investors may have fewer tax credits they are seeking to monetize. Less demand for tax equity could tend to reduce tax equity financing costs from the perspective of investors in targeted activities, reducing the overall rate of return for tax equity investors.",
    "crs_R45100": "Antipoverty interventions that provide resources to local communities, based on the characteristics of those communities, have been of interest to Congress. One such policy, dubbed the \"10-20-30 provision,\" was implemented in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). Title I, Section 105 of ARRA required the Secretary of Agriculture to allocate at least 10% of funds provided in that act from three rural development program accounts to persistent poverty counties; that is, to counties that have had poverty rates of 20% or more for the past 30 years, as measured by the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. One notable characteristic of this provision is that it did not increase spending for the rural development programs addressed in ARRA, but rather targeted existing funds differently. Given Congress's interest both in addressing poverty and being mindful about levels of federal spending, the past four Congresses included 10-20-30 language in multiple appropriations bills, some of which were enacted into law. However, the original language used in ARRA could not be used verbatim, because the data source used by ARRA to define persistent poverty\u2014the decennial census\u2014stopped collecting income information. As a consequence, the appropriations bills varied slightly in their definitions of \"persistent poverty counties\" as it was applied to various programs and departments, sometimes even within different sections of the same bill, if the bill included language on different programs. In turn, because the definitions of \"persistent poverty\" differed, so did the lists of counties identified as persistently poor and subject to the 10-20-30 provision. The bills included legislation for rural development, public works and economic development, technological innovation, and brownfields site assessment and remediation. Most recently, in the 116th Congress, much of the language used in these previous bills was included in P.L. 116-6 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019). This report discusses how data source selection, and the rounding of poverty estimates, can affect the list of counties identified as persistently poor. After briefly explaining why targeting funds to persistent poverty counties might be of interest, this report explores how \"persistent poverty\" is defined and measured, and how different interpretations of the definition and different data source selections could yield different lists of counties identified as persistently poor. This report does not compare the 10-20-30 provision's advantages and disadvantages against other policy options, nor does it examine the range of programs or policy goals for which the 10-20-30 provision might be an appropriate policy tool.",

Congress's decisions on the Aegis BMD program could significantly affect U.S. BMD capabilities and funding requirements, and the BMD-related industrial base.

Any one of these three new weapons, if successfully developed and deployed, might be regarded as a \"game changer\" for defending Navy surface ships against enemy missiles and UAVs. If two or three of them are successfully developed and deployed, the result might be considered not just a game changer, but a revolution. Rarely has the Navy had so many potential new types of surface-ship air-defense weapons simultaneously available for development and potential deployment. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's acquisition strategies and funding requests for these three potential new weapons. Congress's decisions on this issue could affect future Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the defense industrial base. This report supersedes an earlier CRS report that provided an introduction to potential Navy shipboard lasers. Another CRS report provides an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the programs covered in this report, and other Navy programs, may be considered. High-energy lasers (HELs) and railguns are being developed by multiple parts of the Department of Defense (DOD), not just the Navy. HELs, railguns, and GLGP have potential application to military aircraft and ground forces equipment, not just surface ships. And SSLs, EMRG, and GLGP could be used for performing missions other than defense against missiles, UAVs, and surface craft. In particular for the Navy and Marine Corps, EMRG could provide the Navy with a new naval surface fire support (NSFS) weapon for attacking land targets in support of Marines or other friendly ground forces ashore. This report focuses on Navy efforts to develop SSLs, EMRG, and GLGP for potential use in defending Navy surface ships against missiles and UAVs.",
    "crs_R44585": "The Clean Water Act is the principal law governing pollution of the nation's surface waters. Among other requirements, the act prohibits the unauthorized discharge of pollutants into \"navigable waters,\" and requires persons wishing to discharge dredged or fill material into \"navigable waters\" to obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). In its definition section, the act defines the term \"navigable waters\" to mean \"waters of the United States, including its territorial seas.\" This single, jurisdiction-defining phrase applies to the entire law, including the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program; permit requirements for disposal of dredged or fill material, known as the Section 404 program; water quality standards and measures to attain them; oil spill liability and prevention; and enforcement. The Clean Water Act itself does not expand further on the meaning of \"waters of the United States.\" Instead, the Corps and EPA have expounded on this phrase through agency guidance and regulations, which federal courts have struck down on various occasions as failing to satisfy statutory or constitutional requirements. Legal challenges to the Corps' and EPA's interpretation of \"waters of the United States\"\u2014particularly those which were successful\u2014often followed broader trends in interpreting the Commerce Clause. For much of the 20th century, the Supreme Court broadly construed the Commerce Clause to give Congress discretion to regulate activities which \"affect\" interstate commerce, so long as its legislation was reasonably related to achieving its goals of regulating interstate commerce. In the 1995 case of United States v. Lopez, however, the Supreme Court struck down a federal statute for the first time in more than 50 years based purely on a finding that Congress exceeded its powers under the Commerce Clause. In the 114th Congress, the Obama Administration intended the Clean Water Rule to take effect on August 28, 2015, but 31 states and 53 non-state plaintiffs, including industry associations, environmental groups, and others, filed suit challenging its legality. The plaintiffs argued, among other things, that the rule exceeded the agencies' statutory and constitutional authority and did not comply with the rulemaking requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Environmental groups, seven states, and the District of Columbia intervened in defense of the rule. Before any court could address the merits of the claims, however, an impasse arose over what court was the proper forum for the litigation. Whereas some plaintiffs filed suit in federal district courts, others argued that a judicial-review provision in Section 509 of the Clean Water Act gave the U.S. circuit courts of appeals direct appellate-level review over challenges to the Clean Water Rule. At the district court level, some courts dismissed their suits, concluding that the courts of appeals had exclusive jurisdiction over the challenges to the Clean Water Rule. In the interim, while the jurisdictional issue was being litigated, the legal landscape had changed as a result of the Trump Administration's shift in United States' policy toward the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act. The Trump Administration opposes the Clean Water Rule, and it is in the process of attempting to rescind the rule and replace it with new regulations elaborating on the meaning of \"waters of the United States.\" In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing EPA and the Corps to review and revise or rescind the Clean Water Rule. The agencies currently are in the process of carrying out the executive order, and they unveiled proposed regulations redefining \"waters of the United States\" in December 2018. As in nearly all prior attempts to define this phrase, however, observers disagree on whether the latest proposed definition correctly calibrates the scope of federal water pollution regulation. This report provides context for this debate by examining the history of major changes to the meaning of \"waters of the United States\" as expressed in federal regulations, legislation, agency guidance, and case law.",

The Trump Administration encapsulated its assessment of the threat posed by Iran in a late September 2018 State Department report entitled \"Outlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran's Destructive Activities.\" It outlines Iran's malign activities as well as a litany of other activities the Administration terms \"the Iranian regime's destructive behavior at home and abroad.\" The U.S. intelligence community testified in January 2019 that \"Iran's regional ambitions and improved military capabilities almost certainly will threaten U.S. interests in the coming year, driven by Tehran's perception of increasing U.S., Saudi, and Israeli hostility, as well as continuing border insecurity, and the influence of hardliners.\" An annual Defense Department report on Iran's military power required by successive National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs), generally contain assessments similar to those presented publicly by the intelligence community. Iran's foreign and defense policies are products of overlapping, and sometimes contradictory, motivations. One expert asserts that Iran has not decided whether it is a \"nation, or a cause.\" Iran's foreign policy often appears to reflect differing approaches and outlooks among key players and interest groups. Iran's leaders, stressing Iran's well-developed civilization and historic independence, claim a right to be recognized as a major power in the region. They contrast Iran's history with that of the six Persian Gulf monarchy states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman of the Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC), most of which gained independence only in the 1960s and 1970s. Iran's national interests usually dovetail with, but sometimes conflict with, Iran's ideology. Iran's leaders assert that the United States seeks to overturn Iran's regime through support for anti-regime activists, economic sanctions, and alliances with Iran's regional adversaries. Iran's leaders assert that the U.S. military presence in and around the Persian Gulf region reflects intent to intimidate Iran or attack it if Iran pursues policies the United States finds inimical. Iran's leaders assert that the United States' support for Sunni Arab regimes that oppose Iran has led to the empowerment of radical Sunni Islamist groups and spawned Sunni-dominated terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. Iran's national security is not limited to militarily supporting allies and armed factions.

Iran has an active missile development program, as well as other WMD programs at varying stages of activity and capability. Iran has a stockpile of hundreds of missiles that threaten its neighbors in the region. Iran's armed forces have few formal relationships with foreign militaries outside the region. Iran's most significant military-to-military relationships have focused on Iranian arms purchases or upgrades. The Trump Administration has articulated a multilayered strategy to try to counter Iran's malign activities and \"roll back\" Iranian influence in the region. The centerpiece of the strategy is to utilize economic sanctions to change Iran's behavior and deny Iran the resources it needs to continue its regional operations.

Many Congolese reacted positively to the results. Whether the election was \"democratic\" is debatable, however, as is the degree to which Tshisekedi's presidency represents a \"transfer of power.\" Former President Kabila\u2014whose decision to cling to power past the end of his two constitutionally permitted terms in 2016 sparked a national political crisis and widespread protests\u2014appears poised to retain significant political influence. Kabila, who first assumed the presidency in 2000, now holds the title of \"Senator-for-Life,\" while his Common Front for Congo (FCC) coalition won sweeping majorities in parliament and provincial assemblies, and in subsequent indirect elections for the Senate and provincial governors. Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) won very few sub-national contests, and it has agreed to form a coalition government with the FCC. These factors, along with evidence that a more hardline opposition figure won more votes than Tshisekedi, have led many observers to speculate that the official election results reflected a power-sharing deal between Tshisekedi and Kabila. The challenges facing DRC are stark. The country is rich in minerals, forest resources, freshwater, and agricultural potential, but most Congolese live in poverty. Prior to the 2016-2018 impasse over the elections delay and Kabila's political future, international attention toward DRC was overwhelmingly focused on addressing long-running conflicts in the east and supporting the extension of state authority. Security threats, political uncertainty, \"endemic corruption,\" poor infrastructure, and unpredictable regulatory enforcement have contributed to a poor business climate. Ahead of a visit by Tshisekedi to Washington, DC in April 2019, the State Department pledged to work with the new president \"to advance his agenda to combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, enhance security, protect human rights and promote economic growth through increased foreign investment and trade, particularly with the United States.\" The challenges facing DRC are stark.

In the 115th Congress, attention toward DRC focused on deterring President Kabila from clinging to power. H.R. 6207, which passed the House, would have codified the U.S. sanctions framework for DRC (currently imposed under Executive Orders) and potentially compelled additional designations.

Another wears sunglasses and a balaclava that covers his entire head. What they share is the extraordinary danger of their job. Targeted for death by insurgents, they also face suspicion from their employers and often lie to relatives for fear that word of their job will get out. In January 2006, the 109th Congress enacted the first in a series of legislative provisions to enable certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals to become U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) based on their service to the U.S. government. Section 1059 of the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) made certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals who had worked directly with U.S. Armed Forces as translators eligible for special immigrant visas (SIVs). Special immigrants comprise a category of permanent employment-based admissions under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Upon admission to the United States, holders of SIVs are granted LPR status. There is a fundamental tension in the administration of the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs between a sense of urgency to issue visas in a timely fashion to eligible individuals and a need to conduct appropriate security screening. This tension is quite sharp because on the one hand these programs are aimed at individuals who assisted the United States and face danger because of it, and on the other hand there are serious concerns that this population may pose security threats. Overlaying this dynamic is the structure of the SIV programs themselves, with statutory timeframes and numerical limitations. The SIV program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters is ongoing, while the programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government are temporary. As of the date of this report, the temporary Afghan program and the temporary Iraqi program are scheduled to end when all the available visas are issued. The SIV program for translators and interpreters is capped at 50 visas for principal aliens per year. It has been capped at this level for each year except for FY2007 and FY2008, when the cap stood at 500. This program did not originally include carryover provisions, but such language was later added by amendment. As under the other SIV programs, visas that are carried forward but not used in the next fiscal year are lost. Consideration of these numerical limitation and carryover provisions, in conjunction with the visa issuance data for the SIV programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.S. government, indicates that thousands of visas provided for these two programs are no longer available.",
    "crs_R43315": "Water infrastructure issues, particularly regarding funding, continue to receive attention from some Members of Congress and a wide array of stakeholders. Localities are primarily responsible for providing wastewater and drinking water infrastructure services. According to the most recent estimates by states and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), expected capital costs for such facilities total $744 billion over a 20-year period. While some analysts and stakeholders debate whether these estimates understate or overstate capital needs, most agree that the affected communities face formidable challenges in providing adequate and reliable water infrastructure services. Capital investments in water infrastructure are necessary to maintain high quality service that protects public health and the environment, and capital facilities are a major investment for local governments. The vast majority of public capital projects are debt-financed (i.e., they are not financed on a pay-as-you-go basis from ongoing revenues to the water utility). The principal financing tool that local governments use is the issuance of tax-exempt municipal bonds. At least 70% of U.S. water utilities rely on municipal bonds and other debt to some degree to finance capital investments. Beyond municipal bonds, federal assistance through grants and loans is available for some projects but is insufficient to meet all needs. Finally, public-private partnerships (P3s), which are long-term contractual arrangements between a public utility and a private company, currently provide only limited capital financing in the water sector. In recent years, Congress has considered several legislative options to help finance water infrastructure projects, including projects to build and upgrade wastewater and drinking water treatment facilities. Some Members have offered proposals that would amend, supplement, or complement the existing clean water and drinking water State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs. Other proposals would address water infrastructure issues outside the framework of the SRF programs.

    "crs_R44795": "The federal government is vested with the exclusive power to create rules governing alien entry and removal. However, the impact of alien migration\u2014whether lawful or unlawful\u2014is arguably felt most directly in the communities where aliens reside. State and local responses to unlawfully present aliens within their jurisdictions have varied considerably, particularly in determining the role at state or local police should play in enforcing federal immigration law. At one end of the spectrum, some states and localities actively assist federal immigration authorities in identifying and apprehending aliens for removal. For example, jurisdictions sometimes enter into \"287(g) Agreements\" with the federal government, in which state or local law enforcement are deputized to perform certain immigration enforcement activities. Some states and localities have attempted to play an even greater role in immigration enforcement, in many cases because of perceptions that federal efforts have been inadequate. In the past, some have adopted measures that criminally sanction conduct believed to facilitate the presence of unlawfully present aliens and have also instructed police to actively work to detect such aliens as part of their regular duties. The adoption of these kinds of measures has waned considerably, though, after the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States held that several provisions of one such enactment, Arizona's S.B. 1070, were preempted by federal immigration law. Subsequent lower court decisions struck down many other state and local measures that imposed criminal or civil sanctions on immigration-related activity. At the other end of the spectrum, some states and localities have been less willing to assist the federal government with its immigration enforcement responsibilities. Often dubbed \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" some states and localities have adopted measures that limit their participation in enforcing federal immigration laws, including, for example, prohibiting police officers from assisting with federal efforts to identify and apprehend unlawfully present aliens within the state or locality's jurisdiction. That said, there is debate over both the meaning and application of the term \"sanctuary jurisdiction.\" Additionally, state and local jurisdictions have varied reasons for choosing not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including reasons not necessarily motivated by disagreement with federal immigration enforcement policies, such as concern about potential civil liability or the availability of state or local resources to assist federal immigration enforcement efforts. During President Donald Trump's first month in office, he issued an executive order, \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" which, in part, seeks to encourage state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and disincentivize state and local adoption of sanctuary policies. This report discusses legal issues related to state and local measures limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities, as well as the federal government's efforts to counter those measures. It begins by providing a general explanation of the term \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" for the purpose of this report. Next, it provides an overview of constitutional principles underlying the relationship between federal immigration laws and related state and local measures, namely, preemption and the anti-commandeering doctrine. Then, it discusses various types of laws and policies adopted by states and localities to limit their participation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, which may give rise to a label of \"sanctuary jurisdiction,\" and federal efforts to counter those measures. Finally, the report concludes with a discussion of the lawsuits challenging the executive order targeting sanctuary jurisdictions and certain executive branch actions to implement the executive order.",
    "crs_R45459": "The federal crop insurance program offers subsidized crop insurance policies to farmers. Historically, the federal crop insurance program has covered primarily traditional field crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans. In contrast, s pecialty crops\u2014covering fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops\u2014have not been a major part of the federal crop insurance program. However, legislative changes, coupled with ongoing administrative efforts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), have expanded federal crop insurance coverage for specialty crops, and they now account for a small but growing number of federal crop insurance policies bought by farmers. Over the past few decades, total specialty crop insured liabilities rose from nearly $1 billion in 1989 to nearly $18.5 billion in 2017. Federal crop insurance policies currently cover around 38 specialty crop categories, which include roughly 80 types of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops. Many specialty crops, however, do not have crop-specific insurance policies. Currently, about one-half of all U.S. specialty crop acres are covered by federal crop insurance policies. Some specialty crops may be covered under a Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) insurance policy, intended to fill in coverage gaps for producers of uninsured crops that lack individual policy coverage and for producers marketing to local, farm-identity preserved, or direct markets. Despite this expansion, coverage for specialty crops remains below that for traditional crops. Combined, federal crop insurance for specialty crops and WFRP together accounted for about 17% of the entire federal crop insurance portfolio by liability during crop year 2017. This report focuses on how specialty crops are covered under the federal crop insurance program.

    "crs_R40616": "As congressional policymakers continue to debate telecommunications reform, a major discussion point revolves around what approach should be taken to ensure unfettered access to the internet. The move to place restrictions on the owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet, to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment, is referred to as \"net neutrality.\" There is no single accepted definition of \"net neutrality.\" However, most agree that any such definition should include the general principles that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet should not control how consumers lawfully use that network, and they should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network. A major focus in the debate is concern over whether the regulatory framework as delineated in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) 2015 Open Internet Order is the appropriate approach to ensure access to the internet for content, services, and applications providers, as well as consumers, or whether a less regulatory approach contained in the 2017 Order is more suitable. The issue of regulation of and access to broadband networks is currently being addressed in three venues at the FCC, where the commissioners on December 14, 2017, adopted (3-2) an Order that went into effect on June 11, 2018, that revokes the 2015 regulatory framework in favor of one that reverses the 2015 classification of broadband internet access services as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, provides for a less regulatory approach, and shifts much of the oversight from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ); in the courts, where consolidated petitions for review of the 2017 Order are under consideration in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit; and a suit filed in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of California by the DOJ and various trade groups, challenging the legality of a California internet regulation law, is pending; in the 116th Congress, where debate over what the appropriate regulatory framework should be for broadband access continues. Whether Congress will take broader action to amend existing law to provide guidance and more stability to FCC authority over broadband access remains to be seen. The FCC, in its February 26, 2015, open meeting, voted 3-2, along party lines, to adopt new open internet rules (Open Internet Order) that largely reversed the 2015 regulatory framework and shifted much of the oversight from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Order includes among its provisions the following: reclassifies \"broadband Internet access service\" (that is, the retail broadband service Americans buy from cable, phone, and wireless providers) as a telecommunications service under Title II; bans blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization; creates a general conduct standard that internet service providers cannot harm consumers or edge providers (e.g., Google, Netflix) and gives the FCC the authority to address questionable practices on a case-by-case basis (reasonable network management will not be considered a violation of this rule); enhances existing transparency rules for both end users and edge providers (a temporary exemption from the transparency enhancements is given for small fixed and mobile providers) and creates a \"safe harbor\" process for the format and nature of the required disclosure for consumers; permits an internet service provider to engage in \"reasonable network management\" (other than paid prioritization) and will take into account the specific network management needs of mobile networks and other technologies such as unlicensed Wi-Fi networks; eliminates the general conduct standard; seeks comment on the need to \"keep, modify, or eliminate\" the \"bright line\" (no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization) and transparency rules; return authority to the Federal Trade Commission to oversee and enforce the privacy practices of internet service providers; reevaluate the FCC's enforcement regime with respect to the necessity for ex ante regulatory intervention; and conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of the proceeding.

During the past two decades, Congress has established or renewed the existence of hundreds of statutory entities to study, advise on, coordinate, or monitor matters of particular interest to Congress. These entities vary in several dimensions, including their official designation, purpose, lifespan, membership, and mechanism by which members are appointed. Many of these bodies are expressly identified as commissions, but others are designated as boards, advisory committees, or other terms. In this report, they are referred to generically as \"congressional advisory bodies.\" These groups are sometimes created to address a single purpose\u2014to study a discrete policy issue or to attend to one-time or recurring administrative functions. Often, they have a well-defined mandate, which typically includes the submission of a final report to Congress with detailed findings and recommendations. Although some have a specific lifespan, others have been created to provide ongoing support and advice (e.g., the boards of visitors for the U.S. military service academies, or the Commission to Recommend Individuals to the President for Appointment to the Office of Architect of the Capitol). The statutory provisions creating a substantial proportion of congressional advisory bodies provide for a membership that, either entirely or in part, (1) includes, (2) is chosen by, or (3) is recommended by Members of Congress. This report addresses only those statutory groups whose membership involves congressional participation in one or more of these forms. It provides selected background information on these groups and specific information relating to the role of Members of Congress in the appointment process.

    "crs_R42037": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in securing federal contracts; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because assisting small business is viewed as a means to enhance economic growth. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has been operational since April 1971. It is designed to increase small business' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracting, by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds \"on contracts... for small and emerging contractors who cannot obtain bonding through regular commercial channels.\" The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The $6.5 million limit is periodically adjusted for inflation. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds (a payment bond, performance bond, or both a payment and performance bond) with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. Although the surety industry does not report the total value of the bonds it issues each year, estimates based on the total amount of premiums collected by the private sector in recent years suggest that the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program represents, by design, a relatively small percentage of the market for surety bonds (from about 1.1% to 6.7% of the value of surety bonds issued by the private sector). The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program is a three-party instrument between a surety (that agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions.

Fifth-generation (5G) mobile technologies represent the next iteration of mobile communications technologies that were designed to improve current (e.g., 3G, 4G) mobile networks. 5G networks are expected to provide faster speeds, greater capacity, and the potential to support new features and services. 5G technologies are expected to yield significant consumer benefits (e.g., assisting the disabled, enabling telemedicine), industrial benefits (e.g., automated processes, increased operational efficiencies, data analytics), and economic benefits (e.g., new revenues, new jobs). Past experience has shown that companies first to market with new technologies capture the bulk of the revenues. Hence, companies around the world are racing to develop and deploy 5G technologies, and many countries (e.g., central governments), seeing potential for economic gain, are taking action to support 5G deployment. This competition between companies and countries to lead 5G technologies and capture the bulk of the revenues is often called the \"race to 5G.\" In the United States, Congress has monitored the progress of 5G deployment, and the U.S. position in the race to 5G. Congress has made spectrum available for 5G use, and directed the federal government to identify additional spectrum for future 5G use. Congress has also streamlined processes for deploying 5G equipment (also known as small cells) on federal land; additionally, in 2018, legislation was introduced in the Senate which would have streamlined processes for deploying 5G small cells. To protect national security interests and to ensure the security of 5G networks, Congress restricted federal agencies from purchasing certain foreign-made telecommunications equipment.

    "crs_R45664": "Over the past decade, money launderers have turned to a new technology to conceal the origins of illegally obtained proceeds: virtual currency. Virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Ripple are digital representations of value that, like ordinary currency, function as media of exchange, units of account, and stores of value. However, unlike ordinary currency, virtual currencies are not legal tender, meaning they cannot be used to pay taxes and creditors need not accept them as payments for debt. According to their proponents, virtual currencies (1) have the potential to offer cheaper and faster transactions than traditional bank-centric payment networks, (2) provide inflation-resistant alternatives to traditional fiat currencies, and (3) often involve promising new technologies (such as blockchain technology) that will spur innovation across a variety of fields. However, commentators have argued that the anonymity offered by certain decentralized virtual currencies\u2014that is, virtual currencies that are not issued or maintained by a central organization\u2014makes them an attractive vehicle for money laundering. These observers have contended that criminals often use such virtual currencies not only to buy and sell illicit goods and services, but also to launder illegally obtained fiat currencies. While it is difficult to definitively assess the volume of money laundered through virtual currencies, the virtual currency security firm CipherTrace has estimated that criminals laundered roughly $2.5 billion of Bitcoin on major exchanges between January 9, 2009, and September 20, 2018. An official from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has similarly indicated that virtual currencies have been \"exploited to support billions of dollars of... suspicious activity.\" While such figures represent only a fraction of both global money laundering and virtual currency transaction volume, government officials have identified virtual currencies as a growth industry for money launderers that presents regulators and law enforcement with unique challenges.

Several aspects of LNG use in shipping may be of congressional interest.

    "crs_R45707": "Prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for coverage of terrorism risk. The events of September 11, 2001, changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible terrorism losses. Estimates of insured losses from the 9/11 attacks are more than $45 billion in current dollars, the largest insured losses from a nonnatural disaster on record. These losses were concentrated in business interruption insurance (34% of the losses), property insurance (30%), and liability insurance (23%). Although primary insurance companies\u2014those that actually sell and service the insurance policies bought by consumers\u2014suffered losses from the terrorist attacks, the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers, the insurers of insurance companies. Because of the lack of public data on, or modeling of, the scope and nature of the terrorism risk, reinsurers felt unable to accurately price for such risks and largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance in the months following September 11, 2001. Once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk, primary insurers, suffering equally from a lack of public data and models, also withdrew, or tried to withdraw, from the market. In most states, state regulators must approve policy form changes. Most state regulators agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from commercial policies, just as these policies had long excluded war risks. Terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremely expensive, and many businesses were no longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks. In some cases, such insurance is required to consummate various transactions, particularly in the real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utility sectors. Although the evidence is largely anecdotal, some were concerned that the lack of coverage posed a threat of serious harm\u2014such as job loss\u2014to these industries, in turn threatening the broader economy. In November 2002, Congress responded to the fears of economic damage due to the absence of commercially available coverage for terrorism with passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). TRIA created a three-year Terrorism Insurance Program to provide a government reinsurance backstop in the case of terrorist attacks. The TRIA program was amended and extended in 2005, 2007, and 2015. Following the 2015 amendments, the TRIA program is set to expire at the end of 2020. The original TRIA legislation's stated goals were to (1) create a temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured terrorism losses to allow the private market to stabilize; (2) protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks; and (3) preserve state regulation of insurance. Although Congress has amended specific aspects of the original act, the operation of the program generally follows the original statute. The changes to the program have largely reduced the government coverage for terrorism losses, except that the 2007 amendments expanded coverage to domestic terrorism losses, rather than limiting the program to foreign terrorism.

    "crs_R45666": "The prices paid by consumers for prescription drugs have been a recent area of significant congressional interest. Several committees in the House and Senate have held hearings this year on drug pricing issues, and a number of bills have been introduced in the 116th Congress that seek to address the perceived high costs of prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical products. Because intellectual property (IP) rights, including patent rights and regulatory exclusivities, play an important role in the development and pricing of pharmaceutical products, a key focus of this debate is whether existing IP law promptly balances the need for innovation with the costs that IP may impose on the public. Understanding the interplay between several complex legal regimes is necessary in order to fully make sense of this debate. Patents, which are available to a wide variety of technologies beyond pharmaceuticals, are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to inventions that are new, useful, nonobvious, and directed at patentable subject matter. The holder of a valid patent generally has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, or import a patented invention within the United States for a period beginning when the patent is issued by the PTO and ending 20 years after the date of the patent application. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants regulatory exclusivities upon the completion of the FDA regulatory process necessary to market pharmaceutical products (i.e., drugs and biological products). Exclusivities are granted only to certain pharmaceutical products such as innovative products (e.g., a new active ingredient or new indication for an existing drug) or those that serve a specific need (e.g., treating rare diseases). Regulatory exclusivities prevent FDA from accepting or approving an application by a competitor for FDA approval of a follow-on product (i.e., a generic or biosimilar version) of a previously approved pharmaceutical for a set time period, and/or preclude a competitor from relying on safety and efficacy data submitted by the original manufacturer for a period of time. Depending on the type of pharmaceutical product at issue and other factors, regulatory exclusivities may last anywhere from six months to 12 years. In overlapping ways, both patent rights and regulatory exclusivities can operate to deter or delay the market entry of a generic drug or biosimilar. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has found that national spending on pharmaceutical products has been rising in recent years, predicting that these expenditures would continue to rise faster than overall health spending. Many factors other than IP rights contribute to the price consumers pay for prescription drugs and biologics, including demand, manufacturing costs, R&D costs, the terms of private health insurance, and the involvement of a government insurance program such as Medicaid. That said, pharmaceutical products are frequently protected by IP rights, and some studies have shown that IP rights are among the most important factors driving high drug prices. For example, FDA has found that increased competition from generic drug manufacturers is associated with lower prices for pharmaceuticals. Given that IP rights may allow the rights holder to charge higher-than-competitive prices, and can deter or delay the market entry of generic drug or biosimilar competitors, changes to IP rights or otherwise facilitating competition is seen by some to offer a potential means of lowering prices for pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, several current proposed congressional reforms to lower drug prices would reform the existing legal structure of IP rights in the pharmaceutical context. This report explains how several of these congressional proposals to reduce drug prices would interact with and/or alter existing IP law for pharmaceutical products. First, the report reviews the basics of patent law, FDA law and regulatory exclusivities, and the interaction between patent rights and FDA approval of pharmaceutical products. With this legal background in hand, the report overviews the details of a number of current legislative proposals to change these laws in order to reduce the drug prices paid by consumers.",

When comparing the Administration's FY2020 request to the FY2019 funding, it should be considered that the Administration formulated its FY2020 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2019 were enacted. The Administration requests the following: $12.214 billion for the Department of Commerce, which is $801 million (+7.0%) more than FY2019 enacted funding; $30.529 billion for the Department of Justice, which is $405 million (-1.3%) less than FY2019 enacted funding; $28.092 billion for the science agencies, which is $1.491 billion (-5.0%) less than FY2019 enacted funding; and $552 million for the related agencies, which is $425 million (-43.5%) less than FY2019 enacted funding. The increase in funding for the Department of Commerce is almost entirely the result of a proposed $2.334 billion (65.7%) increase for the Census Bureau's Periodic Censuses and Programs account. The funding is requested to help the Census Bureau conduct the decennial 2020 Census. The Administration's FY2020 budget for CJS proposes eliminating several agencies and programs: the Economic Development Administration (EDA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, the Community Relations Service (its functions would be moved to DOJ's Civil Rights Division), the COPS Office (grants for community policing activities would be moved to OJP), NASA's Office of STEM Engagement (formerly the Office of Education), and the Legal Services Corporation.

Although they are considered legal tender, they are not minted for general circulation. Instead, they are designed to be collected and to help designated groups raise money to support group activities. Commemorative coin legislation is often proposed by Members of Congress as part of their representational duties. The first commemorative coin was authorized in 1892 for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Issued as a silver half-dollar, the proceeds for the sale of the coin were used \"for the purpose of aiding in defraying the cost of completing in a suitable manner the work of preparation for inaugurating the World's Columbian Exposition.\" Beginning in 1892 and continuing to the present day\u2014with a hiatus between 1954 and 1981\u2014coins have been a part of the commemoration of people, places, events, and institutions. Commemorative coin legislation generally has certain features, including findings that summarize the commemorative subject's history and importance; specifications for denominations, weight, and metallic makeup; design requirements, including required dates, words, and images; start and end dates for minting coins and any other limitations; requirements for selling coins; coin surcharge and distribution to designated groups; and assurances that costs of the coin program are recouped by the U.S. Mint.

The U.S. Mint has stated that all commemorative coin programs have operated at no cost to the taxpayer since 1997. The U.S. Mint also provides advice to the Secretary of the Treasury on theme and design of all U.S. coins and medals. For commemorative coins, the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC) advises the Secretary with regard to events, persons, or places to be commemorated, the mintage level of coins, and commemorative coin designs. The final decision on a coin's design is made by the Secretary of the Treasury. The CCRA requires that certain standards be met before surcharge payments can be distributed to designated recipient groups. The introduction of commemorative coin legislation often serves two purposes: to honor people, places, events, or institutions and to provide designated recipient groups with potential surcharge funds. These two purposes often go together. Since only two coins may be minted in a given year, Congress may face a ranking of which groups are honored at any given time. In making that decision, consideration might be given to coins that are likely to sell their authorized allotment and provide the designated recipient group with disbursed surcharges over coins that might be less popular and might not sell enough units to provide surcharges to the designated recipient group. Alternatively, Congress could decide that a person, place, event, or institution merits a commemorative coin regardless of the potential sales of the coin. Alternatively, Congress could decide that a person, place, event, or institution merits a commemorative coin regardless of the potential sales of the coin. Institutional issues might include committee or chamber rules on the consideration of commemorative coins and the limit on the number of commemorative coins minted per year.",
    "crs_RL31913": "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (P.L. 74-304) requires the House clerk to prepare an engrossment of a joint resolution suspending the statutory limit on the public debt through the end of that year. In other words, such legislation suspending the debt limit would be passed by the House without a separate vote on the debt limit legislation. Instead of a separate vote, the rule stipulates that the vote on the budget resolution is to be considered as the vote on the debt legislation. The Gephardt rule, initially codified as Rule XLIX of the Standing Rules of the House of Representatives, was established by P.L. 96-78 (93 Stat. 589-591), an act to provide for a temporary increase in the public debt limit. The House adopted the legislation (H.R. 5369) by a vote of 219-19198 on September 26, 1979. During consideration of the measure, Representative Gephardt explained that the purpose of the new House rule was to place the consideration of the public debt limit within the context of the overall budget policies contained in the annual budget resolution. In addition, it was intended to reduce the amount of time spent and the number of votes in the House and in committees on the issue of raising the public debt limit. One of the aggregate amounts required to be included in the annual budget resolution is the appropriate level of the public debt. The budget resolution, however, does not become law. Therefore, the enactment of subsequent legislation is necessary in order to change the statutory limit on the public debt. The Gephardt rule, however, did not operate in all of these years. In 11 of the 31 years between 1980 and 2010, the rule was either suspended (1988, 1990-1991, 1994-1997, and 1999-2000) or repealed (2001-2002) by the House. In most cases, the House suspended the rule because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary. At the time, the existing public debt limit was expected to be sufficient. In three cases, the House passed or was expected to pass separate legislation to increase the statutory limit. In four years (calendar years 1998, 2004, 2006, and 2010), while the rule was in effect, the House and Senate did not agree to a conference report on the budget resolution, and therefore the automatic engrossment process under the Gephardt rule was not used.

Between 1980 and 2010, a total of 47 public debt limit changes were signed into law as independent measures or as part of other legislation. The Gephardt rule originated less than a third of these changes. That is, over two-thirds of the 47 public debt limit changes enacted into law during this period originated by procedures other than the House rule, each requiring the House to vote on such legislation. However, the rule effectively allowed the House to avoid a separate, direct vote on 10 (or 21%) of the 47 measures changing the debt limit that were ultimately enacted into law.",
    "crs_R45456": "The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\" This provision requires that a federal prosecutor, in order to charge a suspect with a serious federal crime, secure the assent of an independent investigative and deliberative body comprising citizens drawn from the jurisdiction in which the crime would be tried. Federal grand juries serve two primary functions: (1) they aid federal prosecutors in investigating possible crimes by issuing subpoenas for documents, physical evidence, and witness testimony; and (2) they determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a criminal suspect with the crime or crimes under investigation. Traditionally, the grand jury has done its work in secret. Secrecy prevents those under scrutiny from fleeing or importuning the grand jurors, encourages full disclosure by witnesses, and protects the innocent from unwarranted prosecution, among other things. The long-established rule of grand jury secrecy is enshrined in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which provides that government attorneys and the jurors themselves, among others, \"must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury.\" Accordingly, as a general matter, persons and entities external to the grand jury process are precluded from obtaining transcripts of grand jury testimony or other documents or information that would reveal \"what took place\" in the proceedings, even if the grand jury has concluded its work and even if the information is sought pursuant to otherwise-valid legal processes. At times, the rule of grand jury secrecy has come into tension with Congress's power of inquiry when an arm of the legislative branch has sought protected materials pursuant to its oversight function. For example, some courts have determined that the information barrier established in Rule 6(e) extends to congressional inquiries, noting that the Rule \"contains no reservations in favor of.. congressional access to grand jury materials\" that would otherwise remain secret. Nevertheless, the rule of grand jury secrecy is subject to a number of exceptions, both codified and judicially crafted, that permit grand jury information to be disclosed in certain circumstances (usually only with prior judicial authorization). And because Rule 6(e) covers only \"matters occurring before the grand jury,\" courts have recognized that documents and information are not independently insulated from disclosure merely because they happen to have been presented to, or considered by, a grand jury. As such, even if Rule 6(e) generally limits congressional access to grand jury information, Congress has a number of tools at its disposal to seek materials connected to a grand jury investigation. This report begins with an overview of the standards governing\u2014and exceptions applicable to\u2014grand jury secrecy under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The report also addresses whether and how the rule of grand jury secrecy and its exceptions apply to Congress, including the circumstances under which Congress may obtain grand jury information and what restrictions apply to further disclosures. Concluding this report is a discussion of past legislative efforts to amend Rule 6(e) in order to provide congressional committees with access to grand jury materials.",
    "crs_R45480": "The Department of the Interior (DOI) is a federal executive department responsible for the conservation and use of roughly three-quarters of U.S. public lands. DOI defines its mission as to protect and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage for the benefit of the American people; to provide scientific and scholarly information about those resources and natural hazards; and to exercise the country's trust responsibilities and special commitments to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and island territories under U.S. administration. Initially conceived as a \"home department\" in 1849 to oversee a broad array of internal affairs, DOI has evolved to become the nation's principal land management agency, charged with administering the use of more than 480 million acres of public lands, 700 million acres of subsurface minerals, and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf (OCS). As is the case for many federal departments, DOI's organizational structure and functions are under continual congressional examination as part of Congress's lawmaking and oversight functions. Similarly, DOI's executive branch structure and operations are also the subject of administrative scrutiny. Over the course of the department's roughly 170-year history, DOI has evolved in response to the needs of the nation and at the behest of Congress and the President. Some of these changes have been relatively broad in nature, such as the creation of a new agency or regulatory body. Other shifts have been smaller in scope, such as modifications to interagency processes or reorganizations in how resources or responsibilities are distributed among offices or programs. DOI reorganization proposals put forth by the Trump Administration have renewed attention to the structural relationship between the department's various bureaus and their regulatory responsibilities. In March 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling on agency leaders to, \"if appropriate,\" submit a proposed reorganization plan for their agencies to the director of the Office of Management and Budget within 180 days. In September 2017, then-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke issued a reorganization proposal for DOI in response to this order. In June 2018, President Trump issued a more expansive government-wide reorganization proposal, which included further recommendations and proposals affecting the structure of DOI. In addition to these broader proposals, smaller interagency administrative changes either took effect in FY2019 or are proposed for FY2019 implementation, including the transfer and consolidation of several department offices and programs. This report is a primer to understanding the organizational framework under which DOI operates, while providing context for how ongoing and proposed reorganizations might affect these operations. The report provides a timeline of congressional and executive actions that have shaped the structure and function of DOI since its establishment. It also offers a brief summary of DOI's history, mission, and current structure, as well as an overview of the primary functions of its multiple bureaus and offices as of December 2018. Employment figures and corresponding maps illustrate the varying regional office structures among DOI bureaus, as they exist currently. In addition, the report includes an overview of the annual funding and appropriations process for the department. Although the report provides a broad summary of the proposed reorganization efforts under way or in effect as of December 2018, it does not offer a detailed analysis of these plans or their potential impact on DOI's structure and function. A list of CRS experts for the issue areas covered by DOI and its bureaus is at the end of the report.

    "crs_R41479": "Social Security provides dependent benefits and survivors benefits, sometimes collectively referred to as auxiliary benefits, to the spouses, former spouses, widow(er)s, children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Auxiliary benefits are based on the work record of the household's primary earner. Social Security spousal benefits (i.e., benefits for a wife or husband of the primary earner) are payable to the spouse or divorced spouse of a retired or disabled worker. Social Security survivors benefits are payable to the survivors of a deceased worker as a widow(er), as a child, as a mother or father of the deceased worker's child(ren), or as a dependent parent of the deceased worker. Although Social Security is often viewed as a program that primarily provides benefits to retired or disabled workers, 33% of new benefit awards in 2017 were made to the dependents and survivors of retired, disabled, and deceased workers. Auxiliary benefits play an important role in ensuring women's retirement security. However, women continue to be vulnerable to poverty in old age due to demographic and economic reasons. These reasons can generally be split into demographic reasons and economic reasons. In addition, the design of auxiliary benefits can lead to equity concerns. For example, a beneficiary who qualifies for both a retired-worker benefit and a spousal benefit does not receive both benefits in full. Instead, the spousal benefit is reduced by the amount of the retired-worker benefit; this effectively means the beneficiary receives the higher of the two benefit amounts. Because of this, a two-earner household receives lower combined Social Security benefits than a single-earner household with identical total Social Security-covered earnings, despite paying more in Social Security taxes. Moreover, after the death of one spouse, the disparity in benefits may increase: in a one-earner couple, the surviving spouse receives two-thirds of what the couple received on a combined basis, whereas in some two-earner couples with roughly equal earnings, the surviving spouse receives roughly one-half of what the couple received on a combined basis. In addition, auxiliary benefits do not reach certain groups, such as persons who divorced before 10 years of marriage or mothers who never married. Some proposals have been suggested to increase Social Security benefits to certain, but not all, vulnerable groups. For example, an enhanced widow(er)'s benefit would provide income support to many elderly women and men, but it would not help those who divorced before 10 years of marriage or who never married. Similarly, a caregiver credit for workers who stay at home to care for young children would increase benefits for never-married and divorced women, but it would not help those without children, whether married or unmarried. The consideration of potential changes to Social Security spousal and survivors benefits involves balancing improvements in benefit equity, for example, between one-earner and two-earner couples, with improvements in benefit adequacy for persons who experience relatively higher poverty rates, such as never-married men and women. In addition, the policy discussion about auxiliary benefits may involve balancing benefit increases for spouses and survivors, divorced spouses, or never-married persons with other potential program changes to offset the higher program costs in light of the Social Security system's projected long-range financial outlook.",
    "crs_R44125": "The consumer data industry collects and subsequently provides information to firms about behavior when consumers conduct various financial transactions. Firms use this data to determine whether consumers have engaged in financial transactions that could be costly or beneficial to the firms. For example, lenders rely upon credit reports and scoring systems to determine the likelihood that prospective borrowers will repay their loans. The data may also be used to predict consumer behaviors that would financially benefit firms. Although the general public is likely to be more familiar with the use of credit reporting and scoring to qualify for mortgage and other consumer loans, the scope of consumer data use is much broader. Insured depository institutions (i.e., banks and credit unions) rely on consumer data service providers to determine whether to make checking accounts or loans available to individuals. Insurance companies use consumer data to determine what insurance products to make available and to set policy premiums. Some payday lenders use data regarding the management of checking accounts and payment of telecommunications bills to determine the likelihood that a consumer will fail to repay small-dollar cash advances. Merchants rely on the consumer data industry to determine whether to approve payment by check or electronic payment card. Employers may use consumer data information to screen prospective employees to determine, for example, the likelihood of fraudulent behavior. In short, numerous firms rely upon consumer data to identify and evaluate the risks associated with entering into financial relationships or transactions with consumers. Greater reliance by firms on consumer data significantly affects consumer access to financial products or opportunities. For example, negative or derogatory information, such as multiple overdrafts, involuntary account closures, loan defaults, and fraud incidents, may influence a lender to deny a consumer access to credit. Further, such information may stay on a consumer's reports for several years. The inclusion of negative information may be particularly limiting to consumers under circumstances in which such information is inaccurate or needs to be updated to reflect more current and possibly more favorable financial situations. Furthermore, consumers may find the process of making corrections to consumer data reports to be time-consuming, complex, and perhaps ineffective. The exclusion of more favorable information, such as the timely repayment of noncredit obligations, from standard credit reporting or scoring models may also limit credit access. This report first provides background information on the consumer data industry and various specialty areas. The report examines one prominent specialty area\u2014consumer scoring\u2014and describes various factors used to calculate credit scores. Next, the report provides a general description of the current regulatory framework of the consumer data industry. Finally, the report discusses selected policy issues pertaining to consumer data reports. Specifically, the report addresses policy issues concerning inaccurate or disputed consumer data provided in consumer data reports; how long negative or derogatory information should remain in consumer data reports; differences in billing and collection practices that can adversely affect consumer data reports, an issue of particular concern with medical billing practices; consumer's rights; whether uses of credit bureau data outside of the financial services, such as for employment decisions, adversely affect consumers and should be limited; whether the use of alternative consumer data or newer versions of credit scores may increase accuracy and credit access; and how to address data protection and security issues in consumer data reporting. For each policy issue, the report addresses corresponding legislative and regulatory developments.",
    "crs_R45460": "Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA; P.L. 92-583, 16 U.S.C. 1451-1466) in 1972 and has amended the act 11 times, most recently in 2009. Congress deliberated and passed the act at a time when concern about environmental degradation spurred passage of many of the nation's environmental statutes. CZMA sets up a national framework for states and territories to consider and manage coastal resources. If a state or territory chooses to develop a coastal management program and the program is approved, the state or territory (1) becomes eligible for several federal grants and (2) can perform reviews of federal agency actions in coastal areas (known as federal consistency determination reviews). Since 1972, many of the trends that called congressional attention to coastal management have continued. Over a third of the U.S. population lived in shoreline counties in 2010, with more expected by 2020 as people continue to migrate to coastal areas to take advantage of economic opportunities, retire, and pursue recreational interests. Coastal areas are also home to economic sectors such as fishing, transportation, defense, offshore energy, and tourism and to natural resources such as estuaries, beach systems, and wetlands. The shoreline likely will continue to be affected by pressures to develop and preserve areas, large-scale events (e.g., hurricanes and tsunamis), and long-term changes (e.g., relative sea level, changes in rainfall, wetland loss, and increased temperatures). In addition to responding to these pressures, Congress may continue to consider whether CZMA is being effectively implemented and whether changes should be made to CZMA grant programs. This report provides a review of CZMA with a specific focus on the National Coastal Zone Management Program (NCZMP). The report discusses how and why states and territories may choose to participate in the national program (namely to access federal grant programs and undertake federal consistency determination reviews) and recent issues for Congress. The appendixes include information about amendments to CZMA over time and section-by-section summaries of current CZMA provisions.",
    "crs_R45545": "The House of Representatives has standing rules that govern how bills and resolutions are to be taken up and considered on the floor. However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension of the rules procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber. Most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Motions to suspend the rules and pass the measure require a two-thirds vote, so the procedure is typically reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold. Decisions to schedule bills for consideration under suspension are generally based on how widely supported the measures are, how long Members wish to debate them, and whether they want to propose floor amendments. These decisions are not necessarily related to the subject matter of the measure. Accordingly, measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas but most often address government operations, such as the designation of federal facilities. This report describes the suspension procedure, which is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under suspension during the 114th Congress (2015-2016). The majority of measures considered on the House floor during the 114th Congress were called up under the suspension of the rules procedure. Sixty-two percent of all measures that received floor action were considered under suspension (743 out of the 1,200), compared to those under the terms of a special rule (14%), unanimous consent (7%), or privileged business (16%). Most of the measures considered under suspension were sponsored by members of the majority party. House or Senate majority-party members sponsored 69% of all bills and resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension, while House majority-party members sponsored 467 (71%) of the 660 House-originated measures (designated with an H.R., H.Res., H.Con.Res. or H.J.Res. prefix). Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before their consideration on the chamber floor. In the 114th Congress, the four exceptions were the Committee on House Administration\u2014which had several measures considered by unanimous consent\u2014and the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, and Armed Services, which had at least half of their measures considered pursuant to special rules. For the other committees, suspension measures ranged from 57% to 100% of the total number of the committee's measures receiving floor action. The majority and minority floor managers in the House generally choose measures for suspension that are likely to achieve the two-thirds majority threshold for passage. Thus, almost all suspension measures were passed by the House in the 114th Congress. The full House approved all House resolutions (28), concurrent resolutions (12), joint resolutions (2), and Senate bills (82) that were considered under suspension. The House also passed, via motions to suspend the rules, 612 of the 619 House bills that were initially considered under suspension. Seven bills did not receive the requisite supermajority. Two of these bills were later considered and approved under the terms of a special rule. The remaining five bills did not return to the floor and therefore did not pass the House. The Senate passed 197 of the 619 House bills initially considered under suspension (32%). Additionally, the Senate agreed to 1 of the 2 House joint resolutions and 5 of the 11 House concurrent resolutions considered under suspension of the rules. Of the 703 law-making measures initially considered under suspension during the 114th Congress, 193 House bills, 82 Senate bills, and 1 House joint resolution became public law.",

During the previous decade, U.S. engagement with the Kingdom slowly strengthened as Western countries continued to pressure Hun Sen to abide by democratic norms and institutions and as the U.S. government attempted to prevent Cambodia from falling too heavily under China's influence. Following strong performances by the opposition in the 2013 and 2017 elections, the Cambodian government banned the largest opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in 2017. As a result, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) ran virtually unopposed in the July 2018 National Assembly election and won all 125 seats. The Trump Administration stated that the election \"failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people\" and represented \"the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia's constitution....\" U.S. responses to Hun Sen's recent suppression of the opposition have included the following: In November 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew $1.8 million in assistance to the National Election Committee (NEC). In December 2017, the Trump Administration announced that the U.S. government would \"restrict entry into the United States of those individuals involved in undermining democracy in Cambodia.\" In August 2018, in response to the National Assembly election, the Administration announced that it would \"expand\" the restrictions. Pursuant to Executive Order 13818, which implemented the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (Section 1261 of P.L. 114-328), in June 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Cambodian General Hing Bun Hieng, commander of Hun Sen's bodyguard unit, \"for being the leader of an entity involved in serious human rights abuses\" over a span of two decades. Sanctioned individuals are denied entry into the United States, and any assets that they hold in the United States are blocked. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), enacted on March 23, 2018, imposed conditions upon U.S. assistance to the Government of Cambodia related to democracy and regional security. The act mandated funds for democracy programs and \"programs in the Khmer language to counter the influence of the People's Republic of China in Cambodia.\" In the 116th Congress, on January 8, 2019, Senators Cruz and Coons introduced the Cambodia Trade Act of 2019 (S. 34), which would require a report on the continuing participation of Cambodia in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. On January 11, 2019, Representatives Yoho, McCaul, and Engel introduced the Cambodia Democracy Act of 2019 (H.R. 526), which would impose visa restrictions upon and block assets of Cambodian senior government officials that the President determines have undermined democracy or committed or directed serious human rights violations. Some policy experts maintain that continued U.S. engagement is the most effective course for promoting democratization from within and countering PRC influence. Some contend that many Cambodians view the United States favorably, and that Washington should continue to promote U.S. interaction with democratic forces in the Kingdom.",
    "crs_95-118": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a federal agency established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; P.L. 93-406). It was created to protect the pess of participants and beneficiaries covered by private sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans. These pension plans provide a specified monthly benefit at retirement, usually either a percentage of salary or a flat dollar amount multiplied by years of service. Defined contribution (DC) plans, such as 401(k) plans, are not insured. PBGC runs two distinct insurance programs: one for single-employer pension plans and a second for multiemployer plans. Single-employer pension plans are sponsored by one employer and cover eligible workers employed by the plan sponsor. Multiemployer plans are collectively bargained plans to which more than one company makes contributions. PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering about 37 million people. It paid or owed benefits to 1.4 million people. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans. PBGC provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. PBGC pays a maximum benefit to plan participants. Most workers in single-employer plans taken over by PBGC and multiemployer plans that receive financial assistance from PBGC receive the full pension benefit that they earned. However, among participants in multiemployer plans that were terminated and likely to need financial assistance in the future, 49% have a benefit below the PBGC maximum guarantee and 51% have a benefit larger than the PBGC maximum guarantee. PBGC's single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs operate differently and PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program. Funds from the reserve of one program may not be used for the other program. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of the terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans. The assets of the terminated plan are placed in a trust fund operated by PBGC. The participants in the trusteed plans receive their benefits from PBGC. In the multiemployer program, PBGC does not become the trustee of plans. PBGC makes loans to multiemployer DB pension plans when the plans become insolvent. An insolvent multiemployer plan has insufficient assets available from which to pay participant benefits. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA, enacted as part of P.L. 113-235) allowed, among other provisions, multiemployer DB pension plans that expect to become insolvent to reduce benefits to participants in these plans. An insolvent plan has no assets from which to pay any benefits. Plans that reduce benefits to forestall insolvency would not require financial assistance from PBGC, and would reduce the amount of future financial assistance PBGC would expect to provide. This would likely improve PBGC's financial condition.",
    "crs_R40082": "Medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health care services of most individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and over. In calendar year (CY) 2019, the program is expected to cover about 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $798 billion, accounting for approximately 3.8% of gross domestic product. The Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and individuals enroll in Medicare through the Social Security Administration (SSA). Medicare consists of four parts\u2014Parts A through D. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services. Part B covers a broad range of medical services and supplies, including physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Enrollment in Part B is voluntary; however, most Medicare beneficiaries (about 91%) are enrolled in Part B. Part C (Medicare Advantage) provides private plan options, such as managed care, for beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Part A and Part B. Part D provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage. Each part of Medicare is funded differently. Part A is financed primarily through payroll taxes imposed on current workers (2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers), which are credited to the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. Beginning in 2013, workers with annual wages over $200,000 for single tax filers or $250,000 for joint filers pay an additional 0.9%. Beneficiaries generally do not pay premiums for Part A. In 2019, total Part A expenditures are expected to reach about $328 billion, representing about 41% of program costs. Parts B and D, the voluntary portions, are funded through the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, which is financed primarily by general revenues (transfers from the U.S. Treasury) and premiums paid by enrollees. In 2019, about $2.8 billion in fees on manufacturers and importers of brand-name prescription drugs also will be used to supplement the SMI Trust Fund. In 2019, Part B expenditures are expected to reach about $367 billion, and Part D expenditures are expected to reach about $104 billion, representing 46% and 13% of program costs, respectively. The Part B premium is normally set at a rate each year equal to 25% of average expected per capita Part B program costs for the aged for the year. Higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums set to cover a greater percentage of Part B costs, while those with low incomes may qualify for premium assistance through one of several Medicare Savings Programs administered by Medicaid. Individuals who receive Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) retirement or disability benefits have their Part B premiums automatically deducted from their benefit checks. Part B premiums are generally announced in the fall prior to the year that they are in effect (e.g., the 2019 Part B premiums were announced in October 2018). In 2019, the standard monthly Part B premium is $135.50. However, about 3.5% of Part B enrollees are protected by a hold-harmless provision in the Social Security Act that prevents their Medicare Part B premiums from increasing more than the annual dollar amount of the increase in their Social Security benefit payments. These individuals pay premiums of less than $135.50. In addition to premiums, Part B beneficiaries may pay other out-of-pocket costs when they use services. The annual deductible for Part B services is $185.00 in 2019. After the annual deductible is met, beneficiaries are responsible for coinsurance costs, which are generally 20% of Medicare-approved Part B expenses. This report provides an overview of Medicare Part B premiums, including information on Part B eligibility and enrollment, late-enrollment penalties, collection of premiums, determination of annual premium amounts, premiums for high-income enrollees, premium assistance for low-income enrollees, protections for Social Security recipients from rising Part B premiums, and historical Medicare Part B premium trends. This report also provides a summary of various premium-related issues that may be of interest to Congress.",
    "crs_RL34619": "Both the Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" Use of the Capitol Grounds requires either the passage of a concurrent resolution or permit approval from the Capitol Police. Events that entail the use of the West Front Steps of the Capitol, electricity on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, require more than 24 hours from setup to cleanup, require vehicles on Capitol Grounds for setup, or will have a large number of Members in attendance typically require a concurrent resolution. All other events can typically be issued permits by the U.S. Capitol Police. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. Additionally, Congress has provided an ongoing authorization for holiday concerts on Capitol Grounds. Held on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, these concerts feature the National Symphony Orchestra and are free and open to the public.",

    "crs_R42580": "The United States has provided assistance to Guatemala since the country's civil war (1960-1996). The United States has also provided assistance to Guatemala through the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), for combating narcotics trafficking and preventing transnational crime; the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); and Food for Peace. The Trump Administration has proposed significantly cutting aid to the region and emphasizing security over development in its budget requests. The Trump Administration has also proposed cutting aid to Guatemala by 36% for FY2020 compared to FY2018 and emphasizing security over development in its budget requests. The 116th Congress remains invested in the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. In February 2019, it passed the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.J.Res. 31, P.L. 116-6), including $528 million for Central America. The act did not provide specific funding amounts for individual countries, but instead gave the Department of State the authority to allocate funding among the Central American nations. The act's conference report, however, did specify $13 million in Global Health Program aid for Guatemala and $6 million for CICIG. The 116th Congress has introduced other bills that touch on perennial concerns involving Guatemala, such as immigration, border security, and governance issues. For example, H.Res. 18, introduced in January would express the sense of the House that the President should redirect and target foreign assistance provided to Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras in a manner that addresses the driving causes of illegal immigration into the United States. S. 716 and H.R. 1630, introduced in March 2019, would impose targeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act against Guatemalan nationals found responsible for, or complicit in, acts of corruption, laundering money, or violating human rights. In March 2019, the Department of Defense announced it was suspending military aid to Guatemala's Ministry of the Interior, which it said had repeatedly used armored jeeps provided by the United States \"in an incorrect way\" since August 2018, when they were deployed outside CICIG and donor embassies when Morales announced he was not renewing CICIG's mandate.

    "crs_RS20348": "The interval during a fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a continuing resolution (CR), is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the relevant regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. Multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. In 1980 and early 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued opinions in two letters to the President that have been put into effect through guidance provided to federal agencies under various Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars clarifying the limits of federal government activities upon the occurrence of a funding gap. The Civiletti letters state that, in general, the Antideficiency Act requires that if Congress has enacted no appropriation beyond a specified period, the agency may make no contracts and obligate no further funds except as \"authorized by law.\" In addition, because no statute generally permits federal agencies to incur obligations without appropriations for the pay of employees, the Antideficiency Act does not, in general, authorize agencies to employ the services of their employees upon a lapse in appropriations, but it does permit agencies to fulfill certain legal obligations connected with the orderly termination of agency operations. In a few cases, Congress has expressly authorized agencies to incur obligations without regard to available appropriations. More often, it is necessary to inquire under what circumstances statutes that vest particular functions in government agencies imply authority to create obligations for the accomplishment of those functions despite a lack of current appropriations. As a consequence of these guidelines, when a funding gap occurs, executive agencies begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The general practice of the federal government after the shutdown has ended has been to retroactively pay furloughed employees for the time they missed, as well as employees who were required to come to work. Under current practice, although a shutdown may be the result of a funding gap, the two events should be distinguished. This is because a funding gap may result in a shutdown of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not in others. For example, when a funding gap is of a short duration, agencies may not have enough time to complete a shutdown of affected projects and activities before funding is restored. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget has previously indicated that a shutdown of agency operations within the first day of a funding gap may be postponed if it appears that an additional CR or regular appropriations act is likely to be enacted that same day. To avoid funding gaps, proposals have previously been offered to establish an \"automatic continuing resolution\" (ACR) that would provide a fallback source of funding authority for activities, at a specified formula or level, in the event that timely enactment of appropriations is disrupted. Funding would become available automatically and remain available as long as needed so that a funding gap would not occur. Although the House and Senate have considered ACR proposals in the past, none has been enacted into law on a permanent basis.",

    "crs_R45417": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers the trade rules and agreements negotiated by its 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade. It also serves as an important forum for resolving trade disputes. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995 and the rules and agreements that resulted from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994). The WTO encompassed and expanded on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations. Through the GATT and WTO, the United States and other countries sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation, stability, and prosperity worldwide. Today, the vast majority of world trade, approximately 98%, takes place among WTO members. The evolution of U.S. leadership in the WTO and the institution's future agenda have been of interest to Congress. The terms set by the WTO agreements govern the majority of U.S. trading relationships. Some 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries that do not have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, including China, the European Union (EU), India, and Japan, and thus rely on the terms of WTO agreements. Congress has recognized the WTO as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within U.S. trade legislation and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. U.S. priorities and objectives for the GATT/WTO are reflected in trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and other executive branch agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade disputes. The WTO has often struggled to reach consensus over issues that can place developed against developing country members (such as agricultural subsidies, industrial goods tariffs, and intellectual property rights protection). It has also struggled to address newer trade barriers, such as digital trade restrictions and the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in international commerce, which have become more prominent in the years since the WTO was established. Global supply chains and advances in technology have transformed global commerce, but trade rules have failed to keep up with the pace of change; since 1995 WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement. As a result, many countries have turned to negotiating FTAs with one another outside the WTO to build on core WTO agreements and advance trade liberalization and new rules. Plurilateral negotiations, involving subsets of WTO members rather than all members, are also becoming a more popular forum for tackling newer issues on the global trade agenda. The most recent round of multilateral negotiations, the Doha Round, began in November 2001, but concluded with no clear path forward, leaving multiple unresolved issues after the 10th Ministerial conference in 2015. Efforts to build on current WTO agreements outside of the Doha agenda continue. While WTO members have made some progress toward determining future work plans, no major deliverables or negotiated outcomes were announced at the 11th Ministerial conference in December 2017 and no consensus Ministerial Declaration was released. Many have concerns that the growing use of protectionist trade policies by developed and developing countries, recent U.S. tariff actions and counterretaliation, and escalating trade disputes between major economies may further strain the multilateral trading system. The WTO is faced with resolving several significant pending disputes, which involve the United States, and resolving debates about the role and procedures of its Appellate Body, which reviews appeals of dispute cases. In a break from past Administrations' approaches, U.S. officials have recently expressed doubt over the value of the WTO institution to the U.S. economy and questioned whether leadership in the organization is a benefit or cost to the United States. While USTR Robert Lighthizer acknowledged at the most recent Ministerial that the WTO is an \"important institution\" that does an \"enormous amount of good,\" the Trump Administration has expressed deep skepticism toward multilateral trade deals, including those negotiated within the WTO. In remarks to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in November 2017, President Trump stated the following: \"Simply put, we have not been",
    "crs_95-563": "The official manual of House rules is more than 1,000 pages long and is supplemented by 30 volumes of precedents, with more volumes to be published in coming years. Yet there are two reasons why gaining a fundamental understanding of the House's legislative procedures is not as difficult as the sheer number and size of these documents might suggest. First, the ways in which the House applies its rules are largely predictable, at least in comparison with the Senate. Some rules are certainly more complex and more difficult to interpret than others, but the House tends to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances. Even the ways in which the House frequently waives, supplants, or supplements its standing rules with special, temporary procedures generally fall into a limited number of recognizable patterns. Second, underlying most of the rules that Representatives may invoke and the procedures the House may follow is a fundamentally important premise\u2014that a majority of Members should ultimately be able to work their will on the floor. Although House rules generally recognize the importance of permitting any minority\u2014partisan or bipartisan\u2014to present its views and sometimes propose its alternatives, the rules do not enable that minority to filibuster or use other parliamentary devices to prevent the majority from prevailing without undue delay. This principle provides an underlying coherence to the various specific procedures discussed in this report. The Constitution authorizes each house of Congress to determine for itself the \"Rules of its Proceedings\" (Article 1, Section 5). This liberal grant of authority has several important implications. First, the House can amend its rules unilaterally; it need not consult with either the Senate or the President. Second, the House is free to suspend, waive, or ignore its rules whenever it chooses to do so. By and large, the Speaker or whatever Representative is presiding usually does not enforce the rules at his or her own initiative. Instead, Members must protect their own rights by affirmatively making points of order whenever they believe the rules are about to be violated. In addition, House rules include several formal procedures for waiving or suspending certain other rules, and almost any rule can be waived by unanimous consent. Thus, the requirements and restrictions discussed in this report generally apply only if the House chooses to enforce them.",

It is a relatively small office, with authorization for up to seven employees. It currently has five employees: a Deputy National Ombudsman (Mina Wales), an administrative officer, an external outreach manager, and two case management specialists. The National Ombudsman position, which is currently vacant, is appointed by the SBA Administrator. The Office of the National Ombudsman's primary purpose is to provide small businesses, small government entities (those serving populations of less than 50,000), and small nonprofit organizations that believe they have experienced unfair or excessive regulatory compliance or enforcement actions (such as repetitive audits or investigations, excessive fines, and retaliation by federal agencies) a means to comment about such actions. As an impartial liaison, the Office of the National Ombudsman \"directs reported regulatory fairness matters to the appropriate agency for high-level fairness review, and works across government to address those concerns, reduce regulatory burdens, and help small businesses succeed.\" SBREFA also created a five-person Small Business Regulatory Fairness Board in each of the SBA's 10 regions to advise the National Ombudsman on matters related to federal regulatory enforcement activities affecting small businesses. Specifically, SBREFA directs the SBA Administrator to designate an ombudsman to work with each federal agency with regulatory authority over small businesses to ensure that small businesses that receive or are subject to an audit, on-site inspection, compliance assistance effort, or other enforcement-related communication or contact by federal agency personnel are provided a means to comment on those regulatory compliance and enforcement activities; receive comments from small businesses regarding actions by federal agency employees conducting small business regulatory compliance or enforcement activities; refer comments to the affected federal agency's inspector general in appropriate circumstances and maintain the confidentiality of the person or small business making these comments; based on substantiated comments received from small businesses and Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, annually report to Congress and affected federal agencies an evaluation of the federal agency's regulatory compliance and enforcement activities, including a rating of the agency's responsiveness to small businesses; provide the affected federal agency with an opportunity to comment on the National Ombudsman's annual report to Congress prior to publication and include in the final report a section in which the affected federal agency may comment on issues that are not addressed by the National Ombudsman in revisions to the draft; and coordinate and report annually on the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards' activities, findings, and recommendations to the SBA Administrator and the heads of affected federal agencies. This report examines the Office of the National Ombudsman's origin and history; describes its organizational structure, funding, functions, and current activities; and discusses a recent legislative effort to enhance its authority.",
    "crs_R44491": "A number of opportunities exist for individuals who are not regular congressional employees to provide assistance to congressional offices. The titles used to describe these positions are sometimes used interchangeably, but there can also be some key differences. An intern is an individual who provides assistance, paid or unpaid, to a congressional office on a temporary basis. The internship experience is typically considered to provide an educational benefit for that individual. An intern's role does not substitute for or replace the duties of regular employees. If an intern is paid, then some of the rules applicable to congressional employees may apply. This report focuses on congressional interns, as described above, although their role can sometimes seem similar to individuals in the following positions: A volunteer also provides assistance to a congressional office, and the experience is generally considered to be of educational value for the volunteer. In many cases, a volunteer's role in a congressional office can be similar to that of an unpaid intern. A volunteer cannot receive financial compensation for his or her service. The volunteer's assignments are not to replace the regular duties of paid employees. A fellow is an individual who also performs services in a congressional office on a temporary basis, but typically through participation in an established, graduate-level or mid-career education program. Fellows often receive compensation from a sponsoring employer, professional association, or other organization while working in Congress during the course of the fellowships. Congressional offices may try to recruit fellows and work with existing programs, but a fellowship is usually not a position a congressional office creates on its own. A page is a high-school junior, at least 16 years old, who participates in a more structured program for a semester or summer. Pages continue to serve in the Senate, but the House program was discontinued in 2010. Although they are appointed by individual Senators, the pages provide assistance as a group in the Senate chamber, and receive housing, education, and a stipend from the Senate. Few statutes or standing rules of the House or Senate make specific references to congressional interns. In many cases, the distinction between a paid internship and an unpaid internship affects which formal rules apply to interns. Guidance and policies for House interns can be found in the House Ethics Manual, in the Members' Congressional Handbook, Congressional C ommittee Handbook, from the House Committee on Ethics, and from the Committee on House Administration. For Senate interns, guidance and policies are mainly found in the Senate Ethics Manual, from the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, and from the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Congressional offices can choose to set additional rules for their interns to follow. House or Senate rules that apply to paid congressional employees generally extend to paid interns as well. These might include, but are not limited to, the Code of Official Conduct for the appropriate chamber, gift restrictions, ban on solicitations, and prohibition on payment for a speech, appearance, or publication. Financial disclosure rules may also apply in the Senate if the intern is receiving compensation from a source other than the U.S. government. Paid interns are exempt from some provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that otherwise apply to congressional staff, like minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, as well as employee benefits, like insurance and retirement. Fewer House or Senate rules may apply to unpaid interns than to paid interns. To enhance accountability for unpaid interns, the House or Senate ethics committees or individual congressional offices can set standards for unpaid interns to abide by that mirror some of the same rules that paid interns or congressional employees follow. A congressional office can enforce the rules it sets as internal office policies for unpaid interns, whereas the House and Senate institutionally may have fewer enforcement mechanisms affecting unpaid interns.",
    "crs_R41057": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs that support small businesses, including loan guarantees to lenders to encourage them to provide loans to small businesses \"that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions\" and grants to nonprofit organizations to provide marketing, management, and technical training assistance to small business owners. Historically, one of the justifications presented for funding the SBA's loan guarantee programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage, compared with other businesses, when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit. It has been argued that this disadvantage is particularly acute for startups and microbusinesses (firms with fewer than five employees): Traditional lending institutions, such as banks and investors, are unlikely to offer loans and investment capital to microfirms due to a variety of reasons. One barrier to microlending is a concern that startups and smaller enterprises are risky investments since growing businesses typically exhibit erratic bursts of growth and downturn. Another issue is that microbusinesses by and large require smaller amounts of capital, and thus banks or investment companies often believe that it is not efficient use of their time or resources, nor will they receive a substantive return on investment from such a small loan amount. Since its inception in 1953, the SBA has provided loan guarantees to encourage lenders to issue small businesses loans. Interest in creating a separate loan program to address the specific needs of startups and microbusinesses increased during the 1980s, primarily because microloans are viewed as a means to assist very small businesses, especially women- and minority-owned startups, obtain loans that enable them to create jobs. Job creation and preservation, always a congressional interest, has taken on increased importance given continuing concerns about job growth. This report describes the Microloan program's eligibility standards and operating requirements for lenders and borrowers and examines the arguments presented by the program's critics and advocates. It also examines changes to the program authorized by P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, P.L. 115-141, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, and P.L. 115-232, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. P.L. 111-240 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to encourage community banks to provide small business loans ($4.0 billion was issued), a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. It also authorized changes to the SBA's loan guaranty programs, including increasing the Microloan program's loan limit for borrowers from $35,000 to $50,000, and the aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $3.5 million to $5 million. It also authorized the SBA to waive, in whole or in part through FY2012, the nonfederal share requirement for loans to the Microloan program's intermediaries and for grants made to Microloan intermediaries for small business marketing, management, and technical assistance for up to a fiscal year. P.L. 115-141, among other provisions, relaxed requirements on Microloan intermediaries that prohibited them from spending more than 25% of their technical assistance grant funds on prospective borrowers and more than 25% of those grant funds on contracts with third parties to provide that technical assistance. The act increased those percentages to 50% (originally in H.R. 2056, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2017, and S. 526, its companion bill in the Senate). Also, P.L. 115-232, among other provisions, increased the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million. This report also discusses several bills introduced during the 114th and 115th Congresses. For example, during the 114th Congress, S. 1445, the Microloan Act of 2015, would have removed the requirements that no more than 25% of Microloan technical assistance grant funds may be used to provide information and technical assistance to prospective borrowers or on third-party contracts to provide that assistance. It would have also eliminated the Microloan program's minimum state allocation formula. H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015, and S. 1857, the Senate companion bill, would have increased the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million, increased the program's repayment terms from not more than 6 years to not more than 10 years",
    "crs_R45712": "The U.S. government administers multiple international food assistance programs that aim to alleviate hunger and improve food security in other countries. Some of these programs provide emergency assistance to people affected by conflict or natural disaster. Other programs provide nonemergency assistance to address chronic poverty and hunger, such as providing food to people during a seasonal food shortage or training parents and community health workers in nutrition. Current international food assistance programs originated in 1954 with the passage of the Food for Peace Act (P.L. 83-480), also referred to as P.L. 480). Historically, the United States has provided international food assistance primarily through in-kind id, which ships U.S. commodities to countries in need. Congress funds in-kind food aid programs through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act\u2014known as the Agriculture appropriations bill. In 2010, Congress established the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP), which provides primarily cash-based food assistance. Cash-based assistance provides recipients with the means to acquire food, including through cash transfers, vouchers, or locally and regionally procured food\u2014food purchased in the country or region where it is to be distributed rather than from the United States. Congress funds EFSP through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations bill. The IDA account also funds nonfood emergency humanitarian assistance, such as provision of shelter and health services. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed eliminating McGovern-Dole and FFP Title II and moving funding for international food aid to the IDA account within the SFOPS appropriations bill. The FY2019 budget request repeated the proposed eliminations and reorganization from the FY2018 request. It also contained a new proposal to eliminate Food for Progress. Congress did not adopt the Administration's FY2018 or FY2019 proposals to eliminate FFP Title II, McGovern-Dole, or Food for Progress. The FY2018 Agriculture Appropriations Act (Division A of P.L. 115-141) provided $1.924 billion for international food aid programs, a 7% increase from the FY2017 enacted total of $1.802 billion. The FY2018 total was also an increase from the FY2018 Senate-passed ($1.807 billion) and House-passed ($1.602 billion) Agriculture appropriations bills. Congress did not adopt the Administration's FY2018 proposals to eliminate FFP Title II, McGovern-Dole, or Food for Progress. The FY2019 act provides $1.716 billion for FFP Title II, equal to the FY2018 enacted amount. This includes $1.5 billion in the Foreign Assistance title and an additional $216 million in the General Provisions title. The act also provides $210.3 million for McGovern-Dole, a 1% increase from the $207.6 million provided in FY2018. The FY2019 act also directs $15 million of McGovern-Dole funding be made available for local and regional procurement (LRP), a $5 million increase from the $10 million set-aside for LRP in FY2018. The FY2019 act also provides $142,000 for FFP Title I and Food for Progress administrative expenses, a 5% decrease from the FY2018 enacted amount of $149,000. The act also provides $16 million for Food for Progress in the General Provisions title, including $6 million in discretionary appropriations and a $10 million Change in Mandatory Program Spending (CHIMP) increase. The FY2019 conference report states that \"this increase is a restoration of funding from reductions occurring in prior years and does not indicate support for expanding or continuing the practice of monetization in food aid programs.\" The FY2019 House-reported bill would have provided $35 million for Food for Progress. Neither the FY2018 act, the FY2019 Administration's budget request, nor the FY2019 Senate-passed bill included discretionary funding for Food for Progress. Food for Progress has not typically received discretionary appropriations; rather it has relied entirely on mandatory funding delivered through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).",
    "crs_R44934": "This report focuses on FY2019 discretionary appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. At issue for Congress were determining the amount of funding for agencies and programs in the bill, and the terms and conditions of such funding. This report first presents a short overview of the agencies and other entities funded in the bill. It then describes the appropriations requested by President Trump for FY2019 for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Next, it briefly compares the appropriations enacted for FY2018 with the FY2019 appropriations requested by the President; passed by the House in H.R. 6147 (115th Congress) on July 19, 2018; passed by the Senate, also in H.R. 6147 (115th Congress) on August 1, 2018; and enacted in Division E of P.L. 116-6 on February 15, 2019. Finally, this report compares FY2018 and FY2019 funding for several agencies and issues that have been among those of interest to Congress. They include the Bureau of Land Management, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, Land and Water Conservation Fund, National Park Service, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, and Wildland Fire Management. For FY2019, the enacted appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $35.61 billion. This total was composed of $13.02 billion for DOI agencies in Title I, $8.06 billion for EPA in Title II, $13.74 billion for \"Related Agencies\" in Title III, and $791.0 million in Title IV for certain activities of EPA. The FY2019 appropriation was $300.0 million (0.8%) more than the FY2018 regular appropriation of $35.31 billion, but $975.4 million (2.7%) less than the FY2018 total appropriation of $36.59 billion, including $1.28 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. The FY2019 appropriation was $7.28 billion (25.7%) more than the President's request ($28.34 billion), $305.5 million (0.9%) more than the level passed by the House ($35.31 billion), and $301.0 million (0.8%) less than the level passed by the Senate ($35.91 billion). Because the FY2019 appropriation was not enacted until February 15, 2019, Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies received continuing appropriations for certain periods before that date. Specifically, from the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2018, through December 21, 2018, continuing appropriations were provided at the FY2018 level (in Division G of P.L. 115-141). The continuing resolution (CR) generally provided funds for continuing projects and activities under the same authority and conditions and to the same extent and manner as for FY2018. However, the CR included certain exceptions (\"anomalies\") that changed the purposes or amounts of funds, extended expiring provisions of law, or made other changes to existing law. The CR expired after December 21, 2018, before being extended on January 25, 2019, through February 15, 2019. As a result of the lapse in funds, a partial government shutdown went into effect between December 22, 2018, and January 25, 2019. During that time, agencies in the Interior bill generally operated under \"contingency\" plans that summarize activities that would cease and activities that would continue during a lapse in appropriations. For FY2019, the total enacted appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $36.59 billion. This total included $35.31 billion in regular appropriations and $1.28 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. As noted, for FY2019, the President sought $28.34 billion for agencies in the Interior bill and a discretionary cap adjustment of $1.52 billion for wildland fire suppression. Neither the House nor the Senate version of H.R. 6147, as passed during the 115th Congress, nor the FY2019 enacted legislation, contained the cap adjustment. H.R. 6147, as passed by the House on July 19, 2018, would have provided $35.31 billion for FY2019. H.R. 6147, as passed by the Senate on August 1, 2018, would have provided $35.91 billion for FY2019. For FY2019, the enacted appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies in P.L. 116-6 was $35.61 billion. Thus, when including the supplemental disaster funding for FY2018, the President's request, House-passed bill, Senate-passed bill, and FY2019 enacted appropriation contained less overall funding for FY2019 as compared to the FY2018 total of $3",
    "crs_R45230": "The Agriculture appropriations bill\u2014formally known as the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act\u2014funds all of USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service. It also funds the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and, in even-numbered fiscal years, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Jurisdiction is with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and their respective Subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. The bill includes mandatory and discretionary spending, but the discretionary amounts are the primary focus during the bill's development. The official discretionary total of the enacted FY2019 Agriculture appropriation is $23.03 billion, $35 million more than was enacted in FY2018 (+0.2%) on a comparable basis that excludes the CFTC. On that same comparable basis, the enacted total is $6.3 billion more than the Administration requested (+38%), $55 million more than was proposed in the House-reported bill (+0.2%) but $194 million less than in the Senate-passed bill (-0.8%). The appropriation also carries mandatory spending\u2014though that is largely determined in separate authorizing laws\u2014that totals nearly $129 billion. Thus, the overall total of the FY2019 Agriculture appropriation is about $152 billion. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2019 bill on May 9, 2018. On May 16, 2018, the full Appropriations Committee passed and reported an amended bill (H.R. 5961, H.Rept. 115-706) by a vote of 31-20. The $23.23 billion discretionary total in the House-reported FY2019 Agriculture appropriation would have been $14 million less than enacted in FY2018 (-0.1%). Generally speaking, the House-reported bill did not include most of the reductions proposed by the Administration and continued the trend of appropriations from prior years. The primary changes from FY2018 that comprised the relatively flat $14 million overall decrease in the House-reported bill\u2014recognizing that some amounts for certain program areas were in the General Provisions title of the FY2018 appropriation\u2014would have done the following: Increased base FDA appropriations by $308 million (+11%). However, it did not continue to separate FDA funding for the opioid crisis that was in the General Provisions title of the FY2018 appropriation (-$94 million). Increased agricultural research (+$79 million, +2.6%) by raising appropriations for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and National Institute of Agriculture (NIFA). Increased the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) by $16 million (+1.7%). Increased the Rural Utility Service by $82 million (+13%), mostly due to higher base funding for rural water and waste disposal programs. However, the bill did not continue separate funding for rural water that was in the General Provisions title last year (-$500 million) or for telemedicine for the opioid crisis (-$20 million). It would have reduced separate funding for a broadband pilot program while continuing to fund some of it through the General Provisions title (-$50 million). Decreased discretionary appropriations for domestic nutrition assistance programs by reducing WIC by $175 million (-2.8%) and the commodity assistance programs by $15 million (-4.7%). However, the reduction scored in the General Provisions title by rescinding WIC carryover balances was smaller in FY2019, retaining more budget authority (+$500 million). Decreased the base funding in international food assistance Food for Peace grants by $100 million (-6.2%) and would not have continued the extra funding that was in the General Provisions title of the FY2018 appropriation (-$116 million). In addition to discretionary spending, the House-reported bill also carried funding for mandatory spending\u2014largely determined in separate authorizing laws\u2014that would have totaled $121.82 billion, about $936 million less than in FY2018 because of automatic changes in economic conditions and entitlement enrollment rather than any change from congressional action. Thus, the overall total of the House-reported bill was about $145 billion. When an appropriation (or continuing resolution) expires and no further budget authority has been provided, a funding gap exists, which may cause operations to cease at affected agencies. In general, the Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating funds before an appropriations measure has been enacted. Exceptions may allow certain activities to continue, such as for law enforcement, protection of human life or property, and activities funded",
    "crs_R45474": "The changing dynamics and composition of international trade and finance can affect the overall health of the U.S. economy, the success of U.S. businesses and workers, and the U.S. standard of living. They also have implications for U.S. geopolitical interests. Conversely, geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can have major impacts on international trade and finance. These issues are complex and at times controversial, and developments in the global economy often make policymaking more challenging. Congress is in a unique position to address these and other issues given its constitutional authority for legislating and overseeing international commerce. The major focus of the 115th Congress was overseeing the Trump Administration's evolving trade policy. The Trump Administration's approach to international trade arguably represents a significant shift from the approaches of prior administrations, in that it questions the benefits of U.S. leadership in the rules-based global trading system and expresses concern over the potential limits that this system may place on U.S. sovereignty. As such, the Administration's withdrawal from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), imposition of unilateral trade restrictions on various U.S. imports, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), modification of certain provisions in the U.S.-South Korea (KORUS) free trade agreement (FTA), and launch of an extensive review of U.S. participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) were among the most notable developments in U.S. trade policy in the past two years. Other issues before Congress included approving legislation to (1) strengthen the process used to review the national security implications of foreign direct investment transactions in the United States; (2) modernize U.S. development finance tools to help advance U.S. national security and economic interests and global influence; and (3) provide temporary tariff suspensions and reductions\u2014through Miscellaneous Tariff Bills\u2014on certain products not available domestically. Continued focus on economic sanctions against Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and other countries were also of interest to many in Congress. The Trump Administration has displayed a more critical view than past administrations of U.S. trade agreements, made greater use of various U.S. trade laws with the potential to restrict U.S. imports, and focused on bilateral trade balances as a key metric of the health of U.S. trading relationships. As part of this shift in focus, the Administration has placed a greater emphasis on \"fair\" and \"reciprocal\" trade. China has also been a center of attention as the Administration has sought to address longstanding concerns over its policies on intellectual property (IP), forced technology transfer, and innovation. Citing these concerns and others, the President has unilaterally imposed trade restrictions on a number of U.S. imports under U.S. laws and authorities\u2014most of which have been used infrequently since the establishment of the WTO in 1995. During the 115th Congress' second session, many Members weighed in on the President's actions. While some supported his use of unilateral trade measures, others raised concerns about potential negative economic implications of these actions and the risks they pose to the rules-based international trading system. Several Members introduced bills to amend some of the President's trade authorities\u2014for example, to require congressional consultation or approval before imposing new trade barriers. The implications of changes in the U.S. trade landscape for the 116th Congress will depend on a number of factors, including the impact of the Administration's trade actions\u2014particularly increased tariffs\u2014on U.S. industries, firms, workers, and supply chains; the reaction of U.S. trading partners; and the extent to which future actions are in line with core U.S. commitments and obligations under the WTO and other trade agreements. The U.S.-China trade and economic relationship is complex and wide-ranging, and it will likely entail continued close examination by Congress. In addition to specific trade practices of concern, Congress scrutinize the economic and geopolitical implications of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which finances and develops infrastructure projects across a number of countries and regions. Congress may also examine the economic implications of China's industrial policies in high technology sectors, which could potentially challenge U.S. firms and disrupt global markets. How these issues play out, combined with the evolving global economic landscape, raise potentially significant legislative and policy questions for Congress. The 116th Congress may consider (1) legislation to implement the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement; (2) measures to reassert its constitutional authority over tariffs and other trade restrictions or to narrow the scope of how the president can use delegated authorities to impose such restrictions; (3) the extent to which",
    "crs_R45726": "The banking industry plays a critical role in the United States economy, channeling money from savers to borrowers and facilitating productive investment. Among other things, banks provide loans to businesses, help individuals finance purchases of cars and homes, and offer services such as checking and savings accounts, debit cards, and ATMs. In addition to occupying a central role in the American economy, the banking industry is a perennial subject of political interest. While the nature of lawmakers' interest in bank regulation has shifted over time, most bank regulations fall into one of three general categories. First, banks must abide by a variety of safety-and-soundness requirements designed to minimize the risk of their failure and maintain macroeconomic stability. Second, banks must comply with consumer protection rules intended to deter abusive practices and provide consumers with complete information about financial products and services. Third, banks are subject to various reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering requirements designed to assist law enforcement in investigating criminal activity. The substantive content of these requirements remains the subject of intense debate. However, the division of regulatory authority over banks between the federal government and the states plays a key role in shaping that content. In some cases, federal law displaces (or \"preempts\") state bank regulations. In other cases, states are permitted to supplement federal regulations with different, sometimes stricter requirements. Because of its substantive implications, federal preemption has recently become a \"flashpoint\" in debates surrounding bank regulation, with one commentator observing that preemption is \"[t]he issue at the center of most disputes between state and federal banking regulators.\" This report provides an overview of banking preemption. First, the report discusses general principles of federal preemption. Second, the report provides a brief history of the American \"dual banking system.\" Third, the report discusses the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, where the Court held that federal law preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. Fourth, the report reviews two Supreme Court decisions concerning the extent to which states may exercise \"visitorial powers\" over national banks. Fifth, the report discusses the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC's) preemption rules and provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning the preemption of state consumer protection laws. Finally, the report outlines a number of current issues in banking preemption, including (1) the extent to which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws, (2) the OCC's decision to grant special purpose national bank charters to financial technology (FinTech) companies, and (3) proposals to provide legal protections to banks serving marijuana businesses that comply with state law.",

Certain trade agreements negotiated by the President, such as agreements that reduce barriers to trade in ways that require changes in U.S. law, must be approved and implemented by Congress through legislation. If the content of the implementing bill and the process of negotiating and concluding it meet certain requirements, TPA ensures time-limited congressional consideration and an up-or-down vote with no amendments. In order to be eligible for this expedited consideration, a trade agreement must be negotiated during the limited time period for which TPA is in effect, and must advance a series of U.S. trade negotiating objectives specified in the TPA statute. In addition, the negotiations must be conducted in conjunction with an extensive array of required notifications to and consultations with Congress and other public and private sector stakeholders. Finally, the President must submit to Congress a draft implementing bill, which must meet specific content requirements, and a range of supporting information. If, in any given case, Congress judges that these requirements have not been met, TPA provides mechanisms through which the implementing bill may be made ineligible for expedited consideration. TPA-2015 incorporates existing expedited procedures (\"trade authorities procedures\") prescribed in Section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 for consideration of trade agreement implementing bills. The expedited TPA procedures include three core elements: a mechanism to ensure timely floor consideration, limits on debate, and a prohibition on amendment. The guarantee of floor consideration is intended to ensure that Congress will have an opportunity to consider and vote on the implementing bill whether or not the committees of jurisdiction or the leadership favor the legislation. Especially in the Senate, the limitation on debate helps ensure that opponents cannot prevent a final vote on an implementation bill by filibustering. The prohibition on amendments is intended to ensure that Congress will vote on the implementing bill in the form in which it is presented to Congress. In these ways, the expedited procedures help assure that Congress will act on an implementing bill, and that if the bill is enacted, its terms will implement the trade agreement that was negotiated. This arrangement helps to increase the confidence of U.S. negotiating partners that law enacted by the United States will implement the terms of the agreement, so that they will not be compelled to renegotiate it or give up on it.",
    "crs_R45725": "The Jones Act, which refers to Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (P.L. 66-261), requires that vessels transporting cargo from one U.S. point to another U.S. point be U.S.-built, and owned and crewed by U.S. citizens. The act provides a significant degree of protection from foreign competition for U.S. shipyards, domestic carriers, and American merchant sailors. It is a subject of debate because some experts point out that it makes domestic ocean shipping relatively expensive, constrains the availability of ships, and contributes to making it much more costly to build merchant vessels in U.S. shipyards than in shipyards abroad. The Jones Act has been an issue in recent Congresses, coming into prominence amid debates over Puerto Rico's economic challenges and recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017; in the investigation into the sinking of the 40-year-old ship El Faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the Administration develop a national maritime strategy, including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping and enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability. In May 2018, the Office of Management and Budget requested public comment on federal requirements that could be modified or repealed to increase efficiency and reduce or eliminate unnecessary or unjustified regulatory burdens in the maritime sector. This report provides background on the Jones Act, discusses the law's requirements, and examines recent controversies over the act. It also discusses the shipbuilding and repair industrial base.",

Significant nuclear cooperation includes the transfer of U.S.-origin special nuclear material subject to licensing for commercial, medical, and industrial purposes, and the export of reactors and critical parts of reactors. Section 123 agreements are required for the export of commodities under Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) export licensing authority (10 C.F.R. 110). Such agreements, which are \"congressional-executive agreements\" requiring congressional approval, do not guarantee that cooperation will take place or that nuclear material will be transferred, but rather set the terms of reference and authorize cooperation. The AEA includes requirements for an agreement's content, conditions for the President to exempt an agreement from those requirements, presidential determinations and other supporting information to be submitted to Congress, conditions affecting the implementation of an agreement once it takes effect, and procedures for Congress to consider and approve the agreement. Section 123 of the AEA requires that any agreement for nuclear cooperation meet nine nonproliferation criteria and that the President submit any such agreement to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The Department of State is required to provide the President with an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS), which the President is to submit, along with the agreement, to those two committees. The State Department is also required to provide a classified annex to the NPAS, prepared in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence. The NPAS is meant to explain how the agreement meets the AEA nonproliferation requirements. The President must also make a written determination \"that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.\" Section 123 of the AEA requires that any agreement for nuclear cooperation meet nine nonproliferation criteria and that the President submit any such agreement to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Such arrangements are required for forms of nuclear cooperation requiring additional congressional approval, such as transfers of nuclear material or technology and recipient states' enrichment or reprocessing of nuclear materials transferred pursuant to the agreement. Subsequent arrangements may also include arrangements for physical security, storage, or disposition of spent nuclear fuel; the application of safeguards on nuclear materials or equipment; or \"any other arrangement which the President finds to be important from the standpoint of preventing proliferation.\" On December 19, 2018, Senators Markey and Rubio introduced S. 3785, the No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act of 2018, and Representatives Sherman and Messer introduced the companion bill, H.R. 7350. The bills would require a joint resolution of approval for a 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia. In addition, the bills' text includes the sense of Congress that no 123 agreement should be approved until Saudi Arabia has \"been truthful and transparent with regard to the death of Jamal Khashoggi\" and prosecuted those responsible, \"renounced uranium enrichment and reprocessing on its territory,\" concluded an IAEA Additional Protocol, and made \"substantial progress on the protection of human rights, including the release of political prisoners.\" The bills require the President to submit a report assessing progress on the above actions along with a proposed agreement. The text also includes a statement of policy that the United States should oppose sales of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia through the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) until Saudi Arabia has renounced enrichment and reprocessing. On December 19, 2018, Representative Brad Sherman introduced H.R. 7351, the Nuclear Cooperation Agreements Reform Act of 2018, which would amend the Atomic Energy Act to require nonexempt nuclear cooperation agreements to include several additional provisions.

    "crs_R45595": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are key federal laws protecting students with disabilities. The IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA all guarantee students with disabilities a free appropriate public education. Those provisions, while similar, are not identical. Their differences largely have to do with details, but they generally can be traced to a more basic difference in statutory design: \"the IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services, while Title II [of the ADA] and [Section] 504 promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions.\" The IDEA's provisions addressing a free appropriate public education (FAPE) are consequently much more detailed than their counterparts in Section 504, the same that apply, according to ED, under Title II of the ADA. These differences among the three statutory schemes have also led to some judicial disagreement about how to relate their violations: specifically, whether denying an eligible child the IDEA's procedural or substantive guarantees also amounts to disability discrimination, in violation of Section 504 (and, by extension, Title II of the ADA). At least some of the lower courts have found these violations to overlap, so that a valid claim under the IDEA will \"almost always\" support one under Section 504. Other courts, however, have taken the opposite view: for them, \"something more than a mere failure to provide the 'free appropriate education' required by [IDEA] must be shown\" before those courts will draw the discriminatory inference required for a violation of Section 504. What a FAPE entails, and what demands it puts on a school district, will therefore vary from student to student. At a minimum, however, a FAPE consists of \"special education and related services\"\u2014\"specially designed instruction,\" in other words, that \"meets the unique needs of a child with a disability, provided at no cost to the child's parents.\" It may include instruction conducted in both academic and nonacademic settings, including in the classroom, in the home, and in hospitals and institutions, as well as instruction in physical education. In comparison, \"related services\" are intended to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education\u2014such as nursing services during the school day for a student who relies on a ventilator. Among the related services provided by the IDEA are speech-language pathology and audiology services; interpreting services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy; recreation, including therapeutic recreation, social work services, counseling services, and, certain medical and school nurse services. Besides special education and related services, under the IDEA and ED's implementing regulations children with disabilities may receive supplementary aids and services and other supports in regular education classes, and in extracurricular and nonacademic settings, to enable them to be educated with nondisabled children to the maximum extent appropriate.",
    "crs_R45719": "A growing number of Americans report that they use marijuana. As more states decriminalize the use of marijuana, the question of what impact marijuana usage has on the risk of a driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash has become more pertinent. In a survey, the majority of state highway safety offices rated drugged driving an issue at least as important as driving while impaired by alcohol. When faced with the issue of driver impairment due to marijuana, some stakeholders tend to approach the issue using the analogy of driver impairment due to alcohol. However, there are important differences between the two substances. The fact that alcohol reduces a user's ability to think clearly and to perform physical tasks has been known for decades. Extensive research has established correlations between the extent of alcohol consumption and impairment, including drivers' reaction times. Much less research has been done on marijuana. That marijuana usage increases a driver's risk of crashing is not clearly established. Studies of marijuana's impact on a driver's performance have thus far found that, while marijuana usage can measurably affect a driver's performance in a laboratory setting, that effect may not translate into an increased likelihood of the driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash in a real-world setting, where many other variables affect the risk of a crash. Some studies of actual crashes have estimated a small increase in the risk of crash involvement as a result of marijuana usage, while others have estimated little or no increase in the likelihood of a crash from using marijuana. Currently, detecting marijuana impairment through a standardized test is more complicated than detecting alcohol impairment. Evaluating impairment due to alcohol is relatively straightforward. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, the effects of which have been extensively observed and studied for a century. It is a liquid that enters the bloodstream quickly and is metabolized (converted into other substances) by the body fairly quickly. The level of THC (the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana) in the body drops quickly within an hour after usage, yet traces of THC (nonpsychoactive metabolites) can still be found in the body weeks after usage of marijuana. There is as yet no scientifically demonstrated correlation between levels of THC in a person's body and the level of impairment, and epidemiological studies disagree as to whether marijuana use by a driver results in increased crash risk. Several factors complicate the effort to determine what, if any, impact marijuana usage has on the likelihood of being involved in a crash. Chief among these factors is the distinction between correlation (things that occur together) and causation (one thing that causes another thing). Several factors complicate the effort to determine what, if any, impact marijuana usage has on the likelihood of being involved in a crash. For example, in the United States the population group with the highest rate of motor vehicle crashes, by far is young male drivers (generally defined as those between the ages of 16 and 19). Young males are also the population group with the highest prevalence of marijuana use. When a young male driver is involved in a motor vehicle crash, and has recently used marijuana, it is difficult to separate the role, if any, of the effects of marijuana usage from the other factors that may contribute to the exceptionally high rate of crash involvement of young male drivers. Federal regulations require that transportation workers in safety-sensitive positions be tested for alcohol and certain drugs before beginning work for a new employer, if they are involved in a serious crash, and also at random. Safety-sensitive employees who appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at work can be tested immediately. Those who test positive must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional, complete counseling or treatment as prescribed by the evaluator, undergo a follow-up evaluation, and be tested again before returning to their safety-sensitive work. Those who return to safety-sensitive work after a positive test must be tested at least six times with no advance notice in the following 12 months. The follow-up period of intensive testing can be extended an additional four years. Approximately 12 million transportation workers are subject to these rules. Regardless of many states having legalized more uses of marijuana, safety-sensitive employees remain subject to drug testing and may lose their jobs for marijuana use that is legal under state law.",

Congress then charged the agency to help in reducing the damages from floods. More recently, Congress has authorized the agency to restore aquatic ecosystems. USACE operates more than 700 dams; has built 14,500 miles of levees; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors, as well as 12,000 miles of inland waterways.

The demand for USACE projects typically exceeds the federal appropriations for these projects. Broadly, Congress is faced with considering how well the nation is addressing its water resource needs and what is the current and future role of USACE in addressing those needs. Part of the issue is how effective, efficient, and equitable is the USACE project delivery process in meeting the nation's needs. Unlike with federal funding for highways and municipal water infrastructure, the majority of federal funds provided to USACE for water resource projects are not distributed by formula to states or through competitive grant programs.

In a study conducted in early 2018, the Pew Research Center found that 68% of U.S. adults use Facebook, 35% use Instagram, and 24% report using Twitter. These sites not only allow users to post content, they also connect users with each other, allowing users to seek out friends and content and often recommending new connections to the user. Through human curation and the use of algorithms, these platforms decide how content is displayed to other users. In curating this content, social media sites may also edit user content, combine it, or draft their own additions to that content. These platforms are generally free to users, and make revenue by selling targeted advertising space, among other things. Thus, social media sites engage in a wide variety of activities, at least some of which entail hosting\u2014and creating\u2014constitutionally protected speech. Social media companies have come under increased scrutiny regarding the type of user content that they allow to be posted on their sites, and the ways in which they may promote\u2014or deemphasize\u2014certain content. A wide variety of people have expressed concern that these sites do not do enough to counter harmful, offensive, or false content. At the same time, others have argued that the platforms take down or deemphasize too much legitimate content. In a September 2018 hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, repeatedly referred to Twitter as a \"digital public square,\" emphasizing the importance of \"free and open exchange\" on the platform. Critically, however, social media sites also have content-moderation policies under which they may remove certain content. Further, these sites determine how content is presented: who sees it, when, and where. As one scholar has said, social media sites \"create rules and systems to curate speech out of a sense of corporate social responsibility, but also.. because their economic viability depends on meeting users' speech and community norms.\" Speech posted on the internet \"exists in an architecture of privately owned websites, servers, routers, and backbones,\" and its existence online is subject to the rules of those private companies. Consequently, one First Amendment scholar predicted ten years ago that \"the most important decisions affecting the future of freedom of speech will not occur in constitutional law; they will be decisions about technological design, legislative and administrative regulations, the formation of new business models, and the collective activities of end-users.\" Commentators and legislators alike have questioned whether social media sites' content policies are living up to the free speech ideals they have espoused. As a result, some, including Members of Congress, have called for regulation of social media platforms, focused on the way those companies police content. In light of this public policy debate, this report begins by outlining the current legal framework governing social media sites' treatment of users' content, focusing on the First Amendment and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). Under existing law, lawsuits predicated on these sites' decisions to remove or to host content have been largely unsuccessful because of (1) doctrines that prevent the First Amendment from being applied to private social media companies, and (2) Section 230 of the CDA, which often protects social media companies from being held liable under federal or state laws for these decisions. The debate over whether the federal government should fill this legal vacuum has raised the question as to whether and to what extent the federal government can regulate the way social media sites present users' content, either to require these sites to take down, restrict access to, or qualify certain types of content, or, on the other hand, protect users' rights to post content on those sites. Such government regulation would constitute state action that implicates the First Amendment. While the issue largely remains an open question in the courts, the First Amendment may provide some protection for social media companies when they make content presentation decisions, limiting the federal government's ability to regulate those decisions. The extent of any free speech protections will depend on how courts view social media companies and the specific action being regulated. Accordingly, the bulk of this report explores how the First Amendment applies to social media providers' content presentation decisions. Looking to three possible analogues drawn from existing First Amendment law, the report explores whether social media",
    "crs_R45481": "The last several years have seen renewed debate over the role that race plays in higher education\u2014a debate over \"affirmative action.\" A high-profile lawsuit challenging Harvard University's consideration of race in admitting its incoming classes, and the recent withdrawal of Obama Administration-era guidance addressing similar race-conscious policies, have focused the debate on \"affirmative action\" in perhaps its more familiar sense: the voluntary consideration of student applicants' race as a way of increasing the participation of racial minorities in higher education. Meanwhile, a recent lawsuit involving Maryland's university system has brought renewed attention to \"affirmative action\" in its other, original sense: the mandatory use of race by public higher education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. This report addresses \"affirmative action\" in each of these two senses and discusses how the federal courts have analyzed them under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"equal protection.\" The report first considers \"affirmative action\" in its original sense: the mandatory race-conscious measures that the federal courts have imposed on de jure segregated public university systems. The Supreme Court has made clear that a state that had a segregated system of education must eliminate all \"vestiges\" of that system, including through expressly race-conscious remedies. In its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, the Court charted a three-step inquiry for assessing whether a state has fulfilled that constitutional obligation, examining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. Outside this de jure context, \"affirmative action\" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court once called the \"benign\" use of racial classifications\u2014voluntary measures designed not directly to remedy past governmental discrimination, but to increase the representation of racial minorities previously excluded from various societal institutions. And in the context of higher education the Court has addressed one type of policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now observed by many public and private colleges and universities. As this report explains, the federal courts have come to subject these voluntary \"affirmative action\" policies to a particularly searching form of review, known today as strict scrutiny. And they have so far upheld those policies under a single theory: that the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body uniquely justify some consideration of race when deciding how to assemble an incoming class. To rely on that diversity rationale, however, the Court now requires universities to articulate in concrete and precise terms what their diversity-related goals are, and why they have chosen those goals in particular. And even once those goals are established, a university must still show that its admissions policy achieves its diversity-related goals as precisely as possible, while ultimately \"treat[ing] each applicant as an individual.\" Because both lines of cases discussed here have their roots in the Equal Protection Clause, this report focuses primarily on public universities, all of which are directly subject to constitutional requirements. But those same requirements apply equally to private colleges and universities that receive federal funds pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI or the Act), which similarly prohibits recipients of federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of race. This report concludes by discussing the role that Title VI plays in ensuring equal protection in higher education, both public and private, including several avenues for congressional action under the Act.",
    "crs_R44121": "The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 was enacted to \"assist in preserving, developing, and assuring accessibility to... outdoor recreation resources.\" Two main goals of the law were to facilitate participation in recreation and \"to strengthen the health and vitality\" of U.S. citizens. To accomplish these goals, purposes of the law included \"providing funds\" for federal land acquisition and for federal assistance to states generally related to outdoor recreation. The fund is authorized to receive $900 million in revenues annually under the LWCF Act. Each year the fund accrues revenues at this level. The fund accumulates the majority of its revenues from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It also accumulates revenues from the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales. However, revenues that accrue under the LWCF Act are available only if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. The LWCF receives additional revenue (beyond the $900 million) from OCS leasing under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). Unlike revenues under the LWCF Act, GOMESA revenues are mandatory appropriations (and thus are not subject to annual appropriation by Congress). They can be used only for grants to states for outdoor recreation purposes. The overall level of annual appropriations (discretionary and mandatory combined) has varied widely since the fund's origin in FY1965. Of the total revenues that have accrued throughout the program's history ($40.9 billion), less than half have been appropriated ($18.9 billion) through FY2019. Thus, the unappropriated balance in the fund is estimated at $22.0 billion through FY2019. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes. It states that of the total made available to the fund, not less than 40% is to be used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% is to be used to provide \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to the acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. With regard to state purposes, the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes. The $18.9 billion appropriated from the fund through FY2019 has been allocated in different proportions among federal land acquisition, the state grant program, and other purposes. The largest portion of the total\u2014$11.4 billion\u2014has been appropriated for federal land acquisition. The state grant program has received the second-largest portion, $4.8 billion. Other purposes have received the remaining $2.7 billion. The balance of this report discusses the other purposes for which LWCF appropriations have been provided throughout the fund's history. It identifies the amount of funding contained in annual appropriations laws for other purposes and the types of purposes for which funds have been appropriated.",
    "crs_R45700": "Disclosure provisions that require commercial actors to convey specified information to consumers occupy an uneasy and shifting space in First Amendment jurisprudence. The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause protects the right to speak as well as the right not to speak, and at least outside the context of commercial speech, courts generally disfavor any government action that compels speech. Indeed, the Supreme Court in 1943 described the First Amendment's protection against compelled speech as a \"fixed star in our constitutional constellation.\" Accordingly, government actions mandating speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny by courts, and will be upheld \"only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.\" However, the Court has also long accepted a variety of laws that require commercial actors to make certain disclosures to consumers, confirming that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Commercial disclosure requirements have largely withstood constitutional scrutiny in part because, historically, commercial speech has received less protection under the First Amendment than other speech. The government's ability to more freely regulate commercial speech has been linked to its general authority \"to regulate commercial transactions.\" Thus, notwithstanding the fact that commercial disclosure requirements compel speech, courts generally have not analyzed such provisions under the strict scrutiny standard. Instead, courts have often employed less rigorous standards to evaluate such provisions. The precise nature of a court's First Amendment analysis, however, will depend on the character of the disclosure requirement at issue. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court distilled and explained its prior cases on this subject. First, the Court said that it has upheld some commercial disclosure requirements that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech. This rubric likely only applies if the disclosure provision is part of a larger scheme regulating commercial conduct. If the disclosure provision instead regulates \"speech as speech,\" it might be subject either to intermediate scrutiny, as a government regulation of commercial speech, or to something closer to rational basis review, if the disclosure provision qualifies for review under the Supreme Court's decision in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. If the disclosure provision instead regulates \"speech as speech,\" it might be subject either to intermediate scrutiny, as a government regulation of commercial speech, or to something closer to rational basis review, if the disclosure provision qualifies for review under the Supreme Court's decision in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Some of the Court's recent cases, however, have suggested that in certain circumstances, disclosure requirements may be subject to heightened scrutiny. This report begins with a short background on how courts generally view commercial speech under the First Amendment, then reviews in more detail the possible legal frameworks for analyzing the constitutionality of commercial disclosure requirements.",

Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state and local systems rather than a single, unified national system. Understanding how those state and local systems work may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way state and local election systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. Most federal action on election administration is carried out by state and local election systems. Interactions between the workings of those systems and federal actions can help determine how effective the federal actions are at achieving their objectives. Second, Congress can require or encourage changes to the way state and local election systems work. Congress has a number of tools for influencing election administration policy. The use of these tools can\u2014either intentionally or unintentionally\u2014affect the workings of the state and local systems that administer federal elections. This report is intended to help Congress understand how state and local election systems work and how their workings might relate to federal activity on election administration. It starts by describing the distribution of election administration duties at the state and local levels and the structures of the state and local systems that conduct elections. It then uses examples from past federal action on election administration to illustrate some of the ways the duties and structures of state and local election systems interact with federal activity.

    "crs_R45478": "The unemployment insurance (UI) system has two primary objectives: (1) to provide temporary, partial wage replacement for involuntarily unemployed workers and (2) to stabilize the economy during recessions. In support of these goals, several UI programs provide benefits for eligible unemployed workers. The Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271) authorizes the joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program to provide unemployment benefits. Most states provide up to a maximum of 26 weeks of UC benefits. The UC program is financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under each state's State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA). The 0.6% effective net FUTA tax paid by employers on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings (equaling no more than $42 per worker per year) funds federal and state administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, the federal share (50%) of Extended Benefit (EB) payments, and state employment services. The Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (EUCA; P.L. 91-373) authorizes the Extended Benefit (EB) program to extend receipt of unemployment benefits (extended benefits) at the state level if certain economic conditions exist within the state. As of the date of this publication, although both the UC and EB programs are authorized, no state is in an active EB period. The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, caused a partial government shutdown. As a result, during this lapse in appropriations, agencies without funding furloughed federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay. The President's budget for FY2020 proposes changes to several aspects of the UI system. It would create a new required standard for state account balances within the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) and a new benefit entitlement for paid parental leave financed through state unemployment taxes. The President's FY2020 budget also proposes a set of additional integrity measures, including the required use of certain databases to confirm UC eligibility and requiring Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits offset UI benefits. On January 16, 2019, Senator Richard Blumenthal introduced S. 165, the Federal Unemployment Compensation Equity Act of 2019. This proposal would amend UCFE law and create a new permanent UCFE eligibility category for excepted federal employees who are unpaid but required to work during a government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations. During any shutdown beginning on or after December 22, 2018, all excepted federal workers would be deemed eligible for UCFE benefits. Additionally, these employees would not be subject to a one-week waiting period (otherwise often required under state laws) before UCFE benefits were to be paid. On January 23, 2019, Representative Debbie Dingell introduced H.R. 725, the Pay Federal Workers Act. This proposal would also provide UCFE benefits in a similar manner to S. 165, including permanently amending 5 U.S.C. Chapter 85 to provide federal authority for these benefits. On February 8, 2019, Representative Katie Hill introduced H.R. 1117, the Shutdown Fairness Act of 2019. This proposal would deem excepted federal employees and unpaid military servicemembers during a government shutdown to be eligible for UCFE or UCX during FY2019. The authority to provide UCFE to these excepted workers would expire at the end of FY2019.

The self-employment assistance benefits would provide weekly income replacement (half of prior earnings up to the maximum weekly benefit amount in the state) for up to of 26 weeks to individuals. They would be available to individuals who are (1) eligible for any type of UI benefit; or ineligible for any type of UI benefit, but became involuntarily unemployed over the previous 12 weeks; or were previously self-employed, but lost a hiring contract, and (2) have a viable business plan approved by their state department of labor, workforce board, or the Small Business Administration. Additionally, Section 3 of S. 136 and H.R. 556 would provide up to $2,000 (or more, depending on family size) to fund to up to 90% of certain relocation expenses for eligible individuals and their families.

The act, among other things, made federal and state prisoners ineligible to receive Pell Grants. The Pell Grant program is the single largest source of federal grant aid supporting postsecondary education students. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was passed during a period when federal and state policymakers were adopting increasingly punitive measuressuch as establishing new crimes, increasing penalties for certain offenses, requiring convicted offenders to serve a greater proportion of their sentences before being eligible for release, and making convicted offenders ineligible for certain government assistance programsas a means to combat violent crime. However, concerns about the financial and social costs of an increasing prison population and what prisons are doing to rehabilitate prisoners and prevent recidivism have led some policymakers to consider whether some of the \"tough on crime\" policies of the 1980s and 1990s need to be changed. Policymakers have started to reconsider whether prisoners should be prohibited from utilizing Pell Grants to participate in postsecondary education programs while they are incarcerated. Legislation was introduced in the 115th and 116th Congresses that would have allowed incarcerated individuals to receive Pell Grants. As Senator Lamar Alexander noted \"most prisoners, sooner or later, are released from prison, and no one is helped when they do not have the skills to find a job. Making Pell Grants available to them in the right circumstances is a good idea.\" In addition, both the Obama Administration and Trump Administration recommended expanding Pell Grants or other targeted federal financial aid to prisoners who are eligible for release after serving a period of incarceration. However, reestablishing prisoners' eligibility for Pell Grants is not without controversy. Legislation was introduced in the 115th Congress that would have ended the Second Chance Pell Experiment, a program begun under the Obama Administration that evaluates the effects of granting prisoners access to Pell Grants. Opposition to allowing prisoners to receive Pell Grants stems from the belief that taxpayer money should not be used to finance the education of prisoners, especially if it might compromise assistance to non-prisoners. Of note, under current Pell Grant program rules, expanding Pell Grant eligibility to prisoners would not affect the eligibility of non-prisoners or award levels of non-prisoners. Many prisoners are interested in participating in postsecondary education, but one of the most significant barriers to prisoners taking college-level classes is their lack of resources. Providing access to Pell Grants could help reduce this barrier. However, there are several issues policymakers might consider before expanding access to Pell Grants, including overall program costs, whether the federal government should support more research on the effects of postsecondary education in correctional institutions, obstacles to providing access to postsecondary education in a correctional environment, and barriers returning prisoners might face when trying to find post-release employment related to their education.",
    "crs_RL32572": "The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, includes plans for the United States to deploy two new types of nuclear weapons \"to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of U.S. nuclear forces.\" The report highlights that these weapons represent a response to Russia's deployment of a much larger stockpile of lower-yield nonstrategic nuclear weapons and to Russia's apparent belief \"that limited nuclear first use, potentially including low yield weapons\" can provide \"a coercive advantage in crises and at lower levels of conflict.\" The two capabilities identified in the NPR are a new low-yield nuclear warhead to be deployed on U.S. long-range submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a new sea-launched cruise missile that could be deployed on Navy ships or attack submarines. The report states that the United States does not need to deploy \"non-strategic nuclear capabilities that quantitatively match or mimic Russia's more expansive arsenal.\" But it indicates that \"expanding flexible U.S. nuclear options now, to include low yield options, is important for the preservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression.\" The NPR's recommended deployment of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons follows growing concerns, both in Congress and among analysts outside of government, about new nuclear challenges facing the United States. For example, in late January 2015, Representatives Mike Rogers and Mike Turner, both members of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to then-Secretary of State John Kerry and then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, seeking information about the agreements that would be needed and costs that might be incurred if the United States sought to deploy dual-capable aircraft and nuclear bombs at bases on the territories of NATO members in Eastern Europe. Neither NATO, as an organization, nor any of the nations who are members of NATO had called on the United States to pursue such deployments. However, Representatives Rogers and Turner noted that Russian actions in 2014\u2014including aggression against Ukraine, noncompliance with the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and threats to deploy nuclear weapons in Crimea\u2014threatened European security and warranted a more potent U.S. response. Some analysts outside government have also called for the deployment of greater numbers and/or types of nuclear weapons in Europe in response to Russia's continuing aggression in Ukraine and its apparent increased reliance on nuclear weapons. Others, however, have argued that more nuclear weapons would do little to enhance NATO's security and that NATO would be better served by enhancing its conventional capabilities. This interest in possible new deployments of U.S. nonstrategic, or shorter-range, nuclear weapons differs sharply from previous years, when Members of Congress, while concerned about Russia's larger stockpile of such weapons, seemed more interested in limiting these weapons through arms control than expanding U.S. deployments. During the Cold War, most public discussions about U.S. and Soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons\u2014including discussions about perceived imbalances between the two nations' forces and discussions about the possible use of arms control measures to reduce the risk of nuclear war and limit or reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons\u2014focused on long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons. These weapons usually had less explosive power and were deployed with launchers that would deliver them across shorter ranges than strategic nuclear weapons. They were intended for use by troops on the battlefield or within the theater of battle to achieve more limited, or tactical, objectives. These \"nonstrategic\" nuclear weapons did not completely escape public discussion or arms control debates. Their profile rose in the early 1980s when U.S. plans to deploy new cruise missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Europe, as a part of NATO's nuclear strategy, ignited large public protests in many NATO nations. Their high profile returned later in the decade when the United States and Soviet Union signed the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and eliminated medium- and intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles. Then, in 1991, President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev each announced that they would withdraw from deployment most of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and eliminate many of them. These 1991 announcements, coming after the abortive coup in Moscow in August 1991, but months before the December 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, responded to growing concerns about the safety and security of Soviet nuclear weapons at a time of growing political and economic upheaval in that nation. They also allowed the United States to alter its forces in response to easing tensions and the changing international security environment. Consequently",
    "crs_R45577": "The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), administered by the Department of Energy (DOE), has been a part of U.S. oil security policy for over 40 years. Originally intended as a reserve to replace oil that might be withdrawn from the world market to forward political purposes and objectives, its rationale has evolved with the changing world oil market and the role of the United States in the market. In addition to replacing oil lost to political turmoil, as in Libya in 2011, in recent years it has been more commonly used to replace oil supplies curtailed due to natural disasters, mainly hurricanes. The effects of hurricanes, especially those of the magnitude of Katrina, Rita, and others, has threatened to disrupt oil production, refining, and distribution, creating potential economic dislocation. Use of oil from the SPR has helped to minimize the economic effect of those events. Since 2010, the oil market in the United States has been transformed. Low growth in petroleum product demand, rapidly increasing domestic oil production, and falling net imports of crude oil and petroleum products have reduced U.S. dependence on foreign oil suppliers. At the same time, export sources on the world market have expanded, reducing the ability of any one exporter, or group of exporters, to manipulate the market. As the U.S. oil position in the world oil market has strengthened, some have questioned whether the SPR should be either downsized to reflect current supply and demand balances, or even eliminated entirely. Since 2015, Congress has passed legislation which mandates the sale of SPR oil to fund a variety of government activities. For some, a question exists as to how much oil might be withdrawn from the Reserve while still maintaining an adequate oil \"safety net.\" Others question whether the evolving world oil market requires the United States to maintain any government-owned reserve holdings. Enacted legislation to date has mandated the sale of over 250 million barrels of oil from the SPR, a situation that brings up another policy issue. If there is less oil in the SPR, what might be done with the \"excess capacity\" inevitably created? The government may be able to reduce the operating costs of the SPR by leasing reserve capacity freed by mandated sales. This report addresses the questions of mandated sales and \"right sizing\" the SPR, as well as strategies to make optimal use of the reduced need for oil storage capacity.",
    "crs_RL34498": "The individual income tax is largely a product of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86; P.L. 99-514). Among other things, the act reduced the individual tax rate structure to two statutory rates: 15% and 28%. TRA86 also imposed a 5% surcharge on the taxable income of certain upper-income households, effectively adding a third marginal tax rate of 33%. Since the enactment of TRA86, several other major changes in the federal individual income tax rate structure have been made. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508) eliminated the 5% surcharge and replaced it with a statutory rate of 31%. In addition, OBRA90 imposed a limit on the amount of itemized deductions upper-income households could claim and accelerated the phaseout of personal exemptions for upper-income households. These provisions had the effect of raising effective tax rates above statutory tax rates for affected taxpayers. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93; P.L. 103-66) added two new statutory rates at the upper end of the income scale: 36% and 39.6%. It also delayed the indexation of the two new tax brackets for one year and permanently extended the limitation on itemized deductions and the accelerated phaseout of the personal exemption from OBRA90. Eight years later, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16) added a new 10% statutory rate. It also included a phased-in reduction in the top four statutory rates to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. Several other provisions of the act modified the tax brackets and limitations on personal exemptions and deductions for higher-income taxpayers. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA; P.L. 108-27), the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 (WFTRA; P.L. 108-311), and the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA; P.L. 109-222) collectively accelerated and extended the tax rate reductions enacted under EGTRRA through 2010. Under a last-minute agreement between President Obama and congressional leaders from both parties, Congress extended the Bush-era individual income tax cuts through 2012 under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (TRUC; P.L. 111-312). Facing the unwanted prospect of an across-the-board increase in all STRs, the 112th Congress permanently extended (through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 [ATRA; P.L. 112-240]) each of the Bush-era STRs, with one exception: the top rate increased from 35% to 39.6%. Six years passed before Congress made another significant change in individual income tax rates. Through P.L. 115-97, often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress temporarily reduced five of the seven individual income tax rates under prior law. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, individual income tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%; they are set to return to the levels that applied in 2017, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026.",
    "crs_R41456": "The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program was created to address concerns raised in a Federal Reserve Board report to Congress that identified a gap in the capital markets for long-term funding for growth-oriented small businesses. The SBA does not make direct investments in small businesses. It partners with privately owned and managed SBICs licensed by the SBA to provide financing to small businesses with private capital the SBIC has raised (called regulatory capital) and with funds (called leverage) the SBIC borrows at favorable rates because the SBA guarantees the debenture (loan obligation). As of December 31, 2018, there were 305 licensed SBICs participating in the SBIC program. In FY2018, the SBA provided $2.52 billion in leverage to SBICs. In recent years, some Members of Congress have argued that the program should be expanded as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. For example, P.L. 113-76, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased the annual amount of leverage the SBA is authorized to provide to SBICs to $4 billion from $3 billion and P.L. 114-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, increased the amount of outstanding leverage allowed for two or more SBIC licenses under common control (the multiple licenses/family of funds limit) to $350 million from $225 million. In addition, P.L. 115-187, the Small Business Investment Opportunity Act of 2017, increased the amount of outstanding leverage allowed for individual SBICs to $175 million from $150 million. Some Members and small business advocates have also proposed that the program target additional assistance to startup and early stage small businesses, which are generally viewed as relatively risky investments but also as having a relatively high potential for job creation. For example, during the 113th Congress, S. 1285 and H.R. 30, the Small Business Investment Enhancement and Tax Relief Act, would have authorized the Administration to establish a separate SBIC program for early stage small businesses. In addition, as part of the Obama Administration's Startup America Initiative, the SBA established a five-year, $1 billion early stage SBIC initiative in 2012. Early stage SBICs are required to allocate at least 50% of their investments in early stage small businesses, defined as small businesses that have never achieved positive cash flow from operations in any fiscal year. The SBA stopped accepting new applicants for the early stage SBIC initiative in 2017. In addition, on June 11, 2018, the SBA withdrew a proposed rule published on September 19, 2016, to amend the initiative to make it \"more attractive and... a permanent part of the SBIC program.\" The SBA indicated that it withdrew the proposed rule \"because very few qualified funds applied to the Early Stage SBIC initiative, the costs were not commensurate with the results, and the comments to the proposed rule did not demonstrate broad support for a permanent Early Stage SBIC program.\" This report examines the SBIC program's structure and operations, focusing on SBIC eligibility requirements, investment activity, and program statistics. It includes information concerning the SBA's debenture SBIC program, participating securities SBIC program, impact investment SBIC program (targeting underserved markets and communities facing barriers to access to credit and capital), and early stage SBIC initiative. This report also discusses legislative efforts that led to an increase in (1) the maximum annual leverage the SBA is authorized to provide to SBICs and (2) the maximum amount of outstanding leverage allowed for two or more SBIC licenses under common control.",

    "crs_RL33028": "The Social Security program pays benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. As of March 2019, there were 63.3 million Social Security beneficiaries. Approximately 70% of those beneficiaries were retired workers and 13% were disabled workers. The remaining beneficiaries were the survivors of deceased insured workers or the spouses and children of retired or disabled workers. Social Security is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and their employers. The program is also credited with federal income taxes paid by some beneficiaries on a portion of their benefits, reimbursements from the General Fund of the Treasury for various purposes, and interest income from investments held by the Social Security trust funds. Social Security tax revenues are invested in U.S. government securities (special issues) held by the trust funds, and these securities earn interest. The tax revenues exchanged for the U.S. government securities are deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury and are indistinguishable from revenues in the General Fund that come from other sources. Because the assets held by the trust funds are U.S. government securities, the trust fund balance represents the amount of money owed to the Social Security trust funds by the General Fund of the Treasury. Funds needed to pay Social Security benefits and administrative expenses come from the redemption or sale of U.S. government securities held by the trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury (the Managing Trustee of the Social Security trust funds) is required by law to invest Social Security revenues in securities backed by the U.S. government. The purchase of U.S. government securities allows any surplus Social Security revenues to be used by the federal government for other (non-Social Security) spending needs at the time. This trust fund financing mechanism allows the General Fund of the Treasury to borrow from the Social Security trust funds. In turn, the General Fund pays back the trust funds (with interest) when the trust funds redeem the securities. The process of investing Social Security revenues in securities and redeeming the securities as needed to pay benefits is ongoing. The Social Security trust funds are both designated accounts within the U.S. Treasury and the accumulated holdings of special U.S. government obligations. Both represent the funds designated to pay current and future Social Security benefits.",
    "crs_RS21212": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers several programs designed to help farmers and ranchers recover from the financial effects of natural disasters, including (1) federal crop insurance, (2) the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), (3) livestock and fruit tree disaster programs, and (4) emergency disaster loans for both crop and livestock producers. All have permanent authorization, while the emergency loan program is the only one requiring a federal disaster designation. Most programs receive mandatory funding amounts of \"such sums as necessary\" and are not subject to annual discretionary appropriations. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334) made a number of amendments to these programs, generally to expand availability and support. Prior to the creation of many of the permanently authorized programs at USDA, Congress had historically provided farmers and ranchers with ad hoc disaster assistance payments authorized through supplemental appropriations. Subsequently, policies shifted away from the temporary forms of assistance in favor of enacting more permanent forms of support. More recently, policies have shifted to supplement permanent programs with ad hoc assistance for select agriculture losses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) amended existing disaster assistance programs and authorized $2.36 billion for production losses from hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 that were not covered by existing programs.

    "crs_RL33375": "The Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program (also known as \"fire grants\" and \"FIRE Act grants\") provides funding for equipment and training directly from the federal government to local fire departments. Since the fire grant program commenced in FY2001, funding has been used by fire departments to purchase firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and firefighting vehicles. Many in the fire-service community argued that notwithstanding the fire grant program, there remained a pressing need for an additional federal grant program to assist fire departments in the hiring of firefighters and the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. They asserted that without federal assistance, many local fire departments would continue to be unable to meet national consensus standards for minimum staffing levels, which specify at least four firefighters per responding fire vehicle (or five or six firefighters in hazardous or high-risk areas). In response to concerns over the adequacy of firefighter staffing, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Act\u2014popularly called the \"SAFER Act\"\u2014was introduced into the 107th and 108th Congresses. The 108th Congress enacted the SAFER provision as Section 1057 of the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 108-136; signed into law November 24, 2003). The SAFER provision was added as an amendment to S. 1050 on the Senate floor (S.Amdt. 785, sponsored by Senator Dodd) and modified in the FY2004 Defense Authorization conference report (H.Rept. 108-354). The SAFER grant program is codified as Section 34 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229a). The SAFER Act authorizes grants to career, volunteer, and combination fire departments for the purpose of increasing the number of firefighters to help communities meet industry-minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing to provide adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. Also authorized are grants to volunteer fire departments for activities related to the recruitment and retention of volunteers. On January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98). P.L. 115-98 extends the SAFER and AFG authorizations through FY2023; extends the sunset provisions for SAFER and AFG through September 30, 2024; extends the USFA authorization through FY2023; provides that the U.S. Fire Administration in FEMA may develop and make widely available an online training course on SAFER and AFG grant administration; expands SAFER hiring grant eligibility to cover the conversion of part-time or paid-on-call firefighters to full-time firefighters; directs FEMA, acting through the Administrator of USFA, to develop and implement a grant monitoring and oversight framework to mitigate and minimize risks of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement related to the SAFER and AFG grant programs; and makes various technical corrections to the SAFER and AFG statute. The SAFER grant program receives its annual appropriation through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. Within the appropriations bills, SAFER is listed under the line item, \"Firefighter Assistance Grants,\" which is located in Title III\u2014Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. \"Firefighter Assistance Grants\" also includes the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. Although authorized for FY2004, SAFER did not receive an appropriation in FY2004. The Administration requested $335 million for SAFER and $335 million for AFG, a reduction of $10 million for each program from the FY2016 enacted level. The Administration's FY2017 budget did not request SAFER waiver authority for FY2017. Under the proposed budget, the SAFER and AFG grant accounts would be transferred to the Preparedness and Protection activity under FEMA's broader \"Federal Assistance\" account. According to the budget request, Federal Assistance programs will \"assist Federal agencies, States, Local, Tribal, and Territorial jurisdictions to mitigate, prepare for, and recover from terrorism and natural disasters.\" On July 18, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018. Unlike the Senate, the House committee did transfer the Firefighter Assistance budget account into a broader Federal Assistance account in FEMA.

The speakership election illustrates the main problem that confronts the minority leader: the subordinate status of the minority party in an institution noted for majority rule. The minority leader is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference. These party leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position. The current minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, served 12 years in the House, including as majority leader, prior to assuming his current role (a position he also held during his time in the California state assembly). Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, served in the House for 16 years when she first became minority leader in the 108th Congress (2003-2004). Following her first tenure as Speaker from 2007 to 2010, Pelosi was again elected minority leader in the 112th Congress (2011-2012), at which point she was a 24-year veteran of the House. When her predecessor, John Boehner, R-OH, was elected minority leader in the 110th Congress (2007-2008), he had served in the House for 18 years including as majority leader, committee chair (Education and the Workforce), and, prior to that, chair of the Republican Conference. Richard Gephardt, D-MO, began his tenure as minority leader in the 104th Congress (1995-1996) as an 18-year House veteran and a former majority leader and chair of the Democratic Caucus. Gephardt's predecessor, Robert Michel, R-IL, became minority leader in 1981 after 24 years in the House. Much like his successors, John Rhodes, R-AZ, had served in the House for 20 years when he was elected minority leader in 1973. While the position itself is usually occupied by Members with significant House experience, the roles and responsibilities of the minority leader are not well-defined. To a large extent, the duties of the minority leader are based on tradition and custom. Broadly speaking, the role of the minority leader in the contemporary Congress is twofold: to serve as the leader and spokesperson for the minority party, and to participate in certain institutional prerogatives afforded to Members in the minority. How the minority leader handles these responsibilities is likely to depend on a variety of elements, including personality and contextual factors; the size and cohesion of the minority party; whether or not the party controls the White House; the general political climate both inside and outside the House; and expectations of the party's performance in upcoming elections. The next section of the report discusses the historical origin of this position, and the sections that follow take account of the various party and institutional responsibilities of the minority leader.",

    "crs_R45695": "Streamgages measure water level and related streamflow at streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs across the country. Streamgages provide foundational information for diverse applications that affect a variety of constituents. Congress has supported a national streamgage program for 130 years. These streamgages operate in every state, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam; therefore, national streamgage operations garner interest from many Members of Congress. Data from streamgages inform real-time decisionmaking and long-term planning on issues such as hazard preparations and response, infrastructure design, water use allocations, ecosystem management, and recreation. Direct users of streamgage data include a variety of agencies from all levels of government, utility companies, consulting firms, scientific institutions, and recreationists. Streamgages are operated across the globe with national programs in North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil, among others. In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Department of the Interior's (DOI's) lead scientific agency, manages the USGS Streamgaging Network. The network encompasses 10,300 streamgages that record water height or streamflow for at least a portion of the year. Approximately 8,200 of these streamgages measure streamflow year-round and are part of the National Streamflow Network. This subnetwork includes 3,640 Federal Priority Streamgages (FPSs), which Congress and the USGS designated as national priorities. Some entities, such as state governments, operate their own streamgages separate from the USGS Streamgaging Network. Congressional appropriations and agreements with approximately 1,400 nonfederal partners funded the USGS Streamgaging Network at $189.5 million in FY2018. Some streamgages are funded solely through congressional appropriations for the USGS and other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and Department of Defense (DOD). Much of the USGS Streamgaging Network is funded cooperatively. Interested parties sign funding agreements with the USGS to share the cost of streamgages and data collection. The USGS Cooperative Matching Funds Program (CMF) provides up to a 50% match with tribal, regional, state, and local partners. Other federal agencies, nonfederal governments, and nongovernmental entities may provide reimbursable funding for streamgages in the USGS Streamgaging Network without contributed funds from the USGS. Evolving federal policies and user needs from diverse stakeholders have shaped the size, organization, and function of the USGS streamgage program. This report provides an overview of federal streamgages by describing the function of a streamgage, the data available from streamgage measurements, and the uses of streamgage information. The report also outlines the structure and funding of the USGS Streamgaging Network and discusses potential issues for Congress, such as funding priorities and the future structure of the nation's streamgage network.",

Both bills were referred to committee in the House but saw no further action. On January 15, 2019, S. 122, Private Corrado Piccoli Purple Heart Preservation Act, was introduced in the 116th Congress. The bill was read twice and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2019, H.R. 5515, included a provision (Section 629) that would extend certain morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) privileges to certain veterans, including Purple Hearts recipients, and their caregivers. This bill became P.L. 115-232 on August 13, 2018.

    "crs_R45558": "On December 21, 2018, President Trump signed into law the First Step Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-391). The act was the culmination of several years of congressional debate about what Congress might do to reduce the size of the federal prison population while also creating mechanisms to maintain public safety. Correctional and sentencing reform was an issue that drew interest from many Members of Congress. Some Members took it up for fiscal reasons; they were concerned that the increase in the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) budget would take resources away from the Department of Justice's (DOJ) other priorities. Other Members were interested in correctional reform due to concerns about the social consequences (e.g., the effects incarceration has on employment opportunities and the families of the incarcerated, or the normalization of incarceration) of what some deem mass incarceration, or they wanted to roll back some of the tough on crime policy changes that Congress put in place during the 1980s and early 1990s. This report provides an overview of the provisions of the First Step Act. The act has three major components: (1) correctional reform via the establishment of a risk and needs assessment system at BOP, (2) sentencing reform that involved changes to penalties for some federal offenses, and (3) the reauthorization of the Second Chance Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-199). The act also contains a series of other criminal justice-related provisions that include, for example, changes to the way good time credits are calculated for federal prisoners, prohibiting the use of restraints on pregnant inmates, expanding the market for products made by the Federal Prison Industries, and requiring BOP to aid prisoners with obtaining identification before they are released.",
    "crs_R43542": "Social Security is the largest program in the federal budget in terms of outlays. There are currently about 63 million Social Security beneficiaries. Most Social Security beneficiaries are retired or disabled workers, whose monthly benefits depend on their past earnings, their age, and other factors. Benefits are also paid to workers' dependents and survivors, based on the earnings of the workers upon whose work record they claim. Social Security has a significant impact on beneficiaries, both young and old, in terms of income support and poverty reduction. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. For both of those reasons, Social Security is of ongoing interest to policymakers. Most proposals to change Social Security outlays would change the benefit computation rules. Evaluating such proposals requires an understanding of how benefits are computed under current law. The first step of computing a benefit is determining a worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), a measure of a worker's past earnings. The AIME computation process first updates past earnings to account for growth in overall economy-wide earnings. That is done by increasing each year of a worker's taxable earnings after 1950 by the growth in average earnings in the economy, as measured by the national average wage index, from the year of work until two years before eligibility for benefits, which for retired workers is at 62. For retired workers, the AIME equals the average of the 35 highest years of indexed earnings, divided by 12 (to change from an annual to a monthly measure). Those years of earnings are known as computation years. If the person worked fewer than 35 years in employment subject to Social Security payroll taxes, the computation includes some years of zero earnings. In the case of workers who die before turning 62 years old, the number of computation years is generally reduced below 35 by the number of years until he or she would have reached 62. For disabled workers, the number of computation years depends primarily on the age at which they become disabled, increasing from 2 years for those aged 24 or younger to 35 years for those aged 62 or older. The next step in computing a benefit is to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA), which is the amount of earnings that a worker receives from Social Security. The PIA is based on earnings up to the maximum taxable amount ($132,900 in 2019) and is subject to the Social Security payroll tax. If a worker earns the maximum taxable earnings in every year of a full work history and becomes eligible in 2019, the maximum PIA is $2,861. The FRA was 65 for people born before 1938, but the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21) raised the FRA for those born later, as shown in the figure. The FRA was 65 for people born before 1938, but the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21) raised the FRA for those born later, as shown in the figure. The permanent reduction in monthly benefits that applies to people who claim before the FRA is called an actuarial reduction. It equals 623% per year for the first three years of early claim and 5% for additional years. The permanent increase in monthly benefits that applies to those who claim after the FRA is called the delayed retirement credit. For people born in 1943 and later, that credit is 8% for each year of delayed claim after the FRA, up to age 70. For people born in 1943 and later, that credit is 8% for each year of delayed claim after the FRA, up to age 70.

    "crs_R44296": "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Budget Act) created the budget resolution and specifies that it be adopted annually. The budget resolution reflects an agreement between the House and Senate on spending and revenue levels. The budget resolution does not become law; therefore no money is spent or collected as a result of its adoption. Instead, it is meant to assist Congress in considering an overall budget plan. Once agreed to by both chambers in the exact same form, the budget resolution creates parameters that may be enforced in two primary ways: (1) by points of order, and (2) by using the budget reconciliation process. The budget resolution reflects an agreement between the House and Senate on a budgetary plan for the upcoming fiscal year. When the House and Senate do not reach final agreement on this plan, the budget process for the upcoming fiscal year may become complicated. Without an agreement on budgetary parameters, it may be more difficult for Congress to reach agreement on subsequent budgetary legislation, both within each chamber and between the chambers. If Congress agreed upon a budget resolution for the prior fiscal year, that resolution remains in effect and may provide some operative parameters, since a resolution includes multi-year enforceable levels. The usefulness of such levels may be limited, however, due to altered economic conditions and technical factors, not to mention any changes in congressional budgetary goals. Without agreement on a budget resolution, Congress also may not use the budget reconciliation process. This means that any budgetary changes to revenue or mandatory spending may not be considered under the special expedited procedures provided by the budget reconciliation process. The Budget Act sought to require adoption of a budget resolution before Congress could consider budgetary legislation for the upcoming fiscal year. Under Section 303(a) of the Budget Act, the House and Senate generally may not consider spending, revenue, or debt limit legislation for a fiscal year until the budget resolution for that fiscal year has been adopted. The Budget Act provides for exceptions, however, and in addition allows the point of order to be waived in both chambers by a simple majority. In the absence of agreement on a budget resolution, other budget enforcement mechanisms are available to Congress comprising two general categories. First, there are types of budget enforcement that are entirely separate from the budget resolution, such as chamber rules and statutory spending caps. These mechanisms remain in effect in the absence of a budget resolution and place restrictions on certain types of budgetary legislation. For example, a limit on defense and nondefense discretionary spending currently exists in the form of annual discretionary spending caps and in addition can act as a guide to appropriators in crafting appropriations measures. In addition, limits on new direct spending and revenue legislation exist through points of order and statutory enforcement such as Senate PAYGO, House CUTGO, and Statutory PAYGO.",

    "crs_R45532": "The term digital economy has fluid meaning in different policy contexts. Broadly speaking, this term can refer to any number of everyday economic activities that are connected over computers, mobile phones, or other internet-connected devices. In the realm of international tax policy, though, certain types of activities and markets have been singled out for selective taxation by some jurisdictions\u2014primarily in Europe. Most of these digital economy business models operate in \"two-sided markets\" in which they provide services to individual users (sometimes at zero charge) and sell other services to businesses (e.g., advertising to users). Proponents of these \"digital services taxes\" justify them on a number of grounds, including the goal of having multinational corporations (MNCs) pay their \"fair share\" of taxes, taxing profits purportedly derived from consumers in their jurisdictions, or adapting traditional rules and systems of international taxation to account for new forms of \"disruptive\" business models that can be conducted virtually over the internet. U.S. opposition to these unilateral taxes has been voiced by several government officials. Robert Stack, while Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs under President Obama, said that such efforts are primarily political efforts to target U.S. corporations. More recently, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has issued multiple statements in opposition to unilateral taxation of digital economy businesses. Some Members of the tax-writing committees in Congress have also criticized these efforts. This report analyzes DST proposals from an economic and policy perspective as they have been introduced, discussed, and adapted in European countries. Some commentators and policymakers argue that MNCs in the digital economy are \"undertaxed\" or are not paying a \"fair share\" of taxes in their jurisdictions. Two issues that often underlie these sentiments are (1) the ability of digital economy MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence (or \"permanent establishment\") in the country in which their customers reside and (2) the ability of digital economy MNCs to shift their profits away from countries where they conduct real economy activity (e.g., sales, development, production) toward low-tax jurisdictions where the MNCs are conducting little to no real economic activity. Even if a country is able to establish the right to tax an MNC's profits in the digital economy (via permanent establishment rules), the profits subject to tax in that jurisdiction could be reduced via transfer pricing rules. The European Commission has proposed a DST on certain revenue from digital activities: selling online advertising, online marketplaces (facilitating the buying and selling of goods and services between users), and sales of data generated from user-provided information. The interim DST would apply only to companies with total annual worldwide revenues of at least \u20ac750 million and EU revenues of at least \u20ac50 million. The European Commission estimated that a 3% tax rate would raise \u20ac5 billion annually for member states. Media reports indicate that the EU-wide proposals have stalled partly due to disagreement among member states with different economic interests and questions as to whether the proposals would be legal under EU law. In support of its digital tax proposals, the European Commission argues that existing tax rules do not account for how value is \"created by users\" in the digital economy. As a result, there is a disconnect\u2014or'mismatch'\u2014between where value is created and where taxes are paid. The European Commission's DST proposal is not structured as a tax on corporate profits. Corporate accounting profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost. In contrast, DSTs are imposed on gross revenue derived from certain business activities (or \"turnover\") and do not take into account costs or net profits earned by the taxable firm. Thus, economic incentives for MNCs to shift profits remain unchanged by DSTs as they do not affect profit-maximizing decisions at the margins. A tax on corporate profits, in a very general sense, taxes corporate income minus the costs of production.

Millions own or use firearms for numerous lawful purposes, such as hunting and protecting themselves in the home. Still, firearms annually cause tens of thousands of injuries and deaths, including in high-profile mass shootings. The widespread lawful and unlawful uses of firearms have prompted vigorous debate over the appropriateness of further firearm regulation. And framing the policy debate are legal issues stemming from the existing federal framework of firearms laws and the constitutional constraints that may cabin Congress's ability to legislate in this area. Firearms regulation at the federal level has grown more expansive over time, setting rules for the lawful manufacture, sale, and possession of firearms at the national level. These federal firearms laws mostly serve as a baseline that states can (and sometimes do) supplement, and Congress regularly considers legislation to address perceived gaps in these laws. Proposals to modify the current federal framework for regulating firearms may be informed by numerous constitutional considerations, including the scope of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and the need to ground legislation in one of Congress's enumerated powers. This report provides an overview of the development of federal firearms laws and the major components of the current statutory regimes governing firearms. It then describes the constitutional considerations that may impact Congress's ability to enact firearms laws.

On July 20, 2017, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, \"[W]hoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world.\" Similarly, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies that will \"ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.\" The U.S. military is already integrating AI systems into combat via a spearhead initiative called Project Maven, which uses AI algorithms to identify insurgent targets in Iraq and Syria. These dynamics raise several questions that Congress addressed in hearings during 2017 and 2018: What types of military AI applications are possible, and what limits, if any, should be imposed? What unique advantages and vulnerabilities come with employing AI for defense? How will AI change warfare, and what influence will it have on the military balance with U.S. competitors? Congress has a number of oversight, budgetary, and legislative tools available that it may use to influence the answers to these questions and shape the future development of AI technology. AI is a rapidly growing field of technology that is capturing the attention of commercial investors, defense intellectuals, policymakers, and international competitors alike, as evidenced by a number of recent initiatives. On July 20, 2017, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, \"[W]hoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world.\" Similarly, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies that will \"ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.\" The U.S. military is already integrating AI systems into combat via a spearhead initiative called Project Maven, which uses AI algorithms to identify insurgent targets in Iraq and Syria.

    "crs_R44599": "In the midst of ongoing concerns about illicit drug use and abuse, there has been heightened attention to the issue of opioid abuse\u2014including both prescription opioids and nonprescription opioids such as heroin. The increased attention to opioid abuse and addiction first centered on the abuse of prescription pain relievers. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), about 3.3 million individuals were current (at least once in the past month) nonmedical users of prescription pain relievers such as OxyContin in 2016. Mirroring the nation's concern about prescription drug abuse, there has been corresponding unease regarding the rise in heroin abuse. In addition to increases in heroin use and abuse, there has been a simultaneous increase in its availability in the United States over the past decade. This has been fueled by a number of factors, including increased production and trafficking of heroin\u2014principally by Mexican criminal networks. Mexican drug traffickers have been expanding their control of the U.S. heroin market, though the United States still receives some heroin from South America and Southwest Asia as well. Notably, while the majority of the world's opium is produced in Afghanistan, only a small proportion of that feeds the U.S. heroin market. Policymakers may want to examine U.S. efforts to counter heroin trafficking as a means of addressing opioid abuse in the United States. This report provides an overview of heroin trafficking into and within the United States. It includes a discussion of links between the trafficking of heroin and the illicit movement of related substances such as controlled prescription opioids and synthetic substances like fentanyl. The report also outlines existing U.S. efforts to counter heroin trafficking and possible congressional considerations going forward.",
    "crs_R43159": "Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA; P.L. 89-329), as amended, authorizes programs that provide financial assistance to students to attend certain institutions of higher education (IHEs). In academic year (AY) 2016-2017, 6,760 institutions were classified as Title IV eligible IHEs. Of these IHEs eligible to participate in Title IV programs, approximately 29.4% were public institutions, 27.8% were private nonprofit institutions, and 42.9% were proprietary (or private, for-profit) institutions. It is estimated that $122.5 billion was made available to students through Title IV federal student aid in FY2017. To be able to receive Title IV assistance, students must attend an institution that is eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. IHEs must meet a variety of requirements to participate in the Title IV programs. First, an IHE must meet basic eligibility criteria, including offering at least one eligible program of education. In addition, an IHE must satisfy the program integrity triad, under which it must be legally authorized to provide a postsecondary education in the state in which it is located; accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education (ED) for such purposes, and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. The state authorization and accreditation components of the triad were developed independently to address the issues of quality assurance and consumer protection, and the federal government (ED specifically) generally relies on states and accrediting agencies to determine standards of educational program quality. The federal government's only direct role in determining Title IV eligibility is through the process of certification of eligibility and ensuring IHEs meet some additional Title IV requirements. Certification, as a component of the program integrity triad, focuses on an institution's fiscal responsibility and administrative capacity to administer Title IV funds. An IHE must fulfill a variety of other related requirements, including those that relate to institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and Title IV program administration. Finally, additional criteria may apply to an institution depending on its control or the type of educational programs it offers. For instance, proprietary institutions must derive at least 10% of their revenues from non-Title IV funds (also known as the 90/10 rule). Failure to fulfill some of these requirements does not necessarily end an IHE's participation in the Title IV programs, but may lead to additional oversight from ED and/or restrictions placed an IHE's Title IV participation.",

    "crs_RL30478": "This report provides background information on the types of water supply and wastewater treatment projects traditionally funded by the federal government and the several existing programs to assist communities with water supply and wastewater treatment. For more than four decades, Congress has authorized and refined several programs to help communities address water supply and wastewater problems. The agencies that administer these programs differ in multiple ways. For example, in terms of funding mechanisms, projects developed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) typically require direct, individual project authorizations from Congress. In contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The key practical difference is that with the individual project authorizations there is no predictable assistance, or even guarantee of funding after a project is authorized, because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process. The programs, on the other hand, have set program criteria, are generally funded from year to year, and provide a process under which project sponsors compete for funding. In terms of scope and mission, the primary responsibilities of USACE are to maintain inland navigation, provide for flood and storm damage reduction, and restore aquatic ecosystems, while EPA's mission relates to protecting public health and the environment. Further, the Department of Commerce and HUD focus on community and economic development. Likewise, the specific programs discussed in this report\u2014while all address water supply and wastewater treatment to some degree\u2014differ in important respects. Some are national in scope (those of USDA, EPA, and the Department of Commerce, for example), while others are regionally focused (Reclamation's programs and projects). Some focus primarily on urban areas (HUD), some on rural areas (USDA). For each of the projects and programs discussed, this report describes purposes, financing mechanisms, eligibility requirements, recent funding, and statutory/regulatory authority. The report does not address special projects and programs aimed specifically at assisting Indian Tribes, Alaskan Native Villages, and colonias, or other regional programs such as those associated with the Appalachian region or U.S. Territories. This report focuses on municipal and industrial (M&I) water and wastewater activities. This report does not address projects and programs that involve irrigation, flood control, power supply, and recreation. However, in some cases (noted below), a federal program (e.g., Reclamation) may primarily support one or more of these other objectives while providing some support for M&I activities, even if only incidentally. Other federal authorities of USDA's Rural Utilities Service, Reclamation, and USACE may be available to assist with the provision of emergency water and wastewater needs, such as improving access to water supplies during a drought. These authorities are not discussed in this report.",
    "crs_R45709": "The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program provides monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. The OASDI program operates as a pay-as-you-go program in which revenues (collected from payroll taxes and taxation of benefits) are paid out as monthly benefits. These monthly benefits constitute a substantial portion of income for a large segment of recipients. The payroll tax and the taxation of monthly benefits are major contributors to the OASDI program's revenues. For many years, the program's revenues exceeded its costs (i.e., benefit payments), resulting in annual surpluses. Annual surpluses are not needed to cover scheduled benefits, and the money is credited to the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, or trust funds. The OASDI Trust Funds are invested in nonmarketable U.S. government securities (government bonds), where they earn interest. This interest provides a third source of revenue to the OASDI program. The combined OASDI Trust Funds had approximately $2.9 trillion in assets at the beginning of 2018. The OASDI Trust Funds' Board of Trustees manages the trust funds according to requirements set forth in the Social Security Act. Under current law, the trust funds' assets may be invested only in U.S. government securities issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. In practice, the trust funds invest solely in special, nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities. By investing only in nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities, or special issues, the trustees have not intervened directly in the private economy. Investing in equities\u2014for example, by purchasing company stock in the open market\u2014would demonstrate a similar departure from the trust funds' investment norms and would represent a government intervention into the private market. Some argue this expansion of investment options would be problematic because it dictates government ownership of, and possibly influence on, private companies. Although this event may never come to pass, the historically higher returns on equity investment may motivate policymakers to enact changes to the OASDI Trust Funds' investment options and practices. This report examines (1) the current policies and practices of the OASDI Trust Funds and (2) alternative investments and the impact of these investments on the OASDI program's long-term solvency. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed relevant research and interviewed relevant experts.

    "crs_R45493": "The international oil market has influenced U.S. domestic and foreign policy decisions for decades. The United States plays a significant role in the world oil market, not only as the top consumer of crude oil and petroleum products, but also as the largest producer. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that the United States surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's number one crude oil producer in 2018. U.S. production is at an all-time high as a result of technological advancements and policy. Despite the recent surge in U.S. oil production, the United States remained a net importer of oil in 2018. Oil availability associates with energy independence and energy security more than any other fuel. Supply, demand, the strength of currencies, and other factors link crude oil to the world market to determine the price. Because the United States is a top consumer and producer of oil, it has the ability to influence this world market. Trade agreements, regulation, sanctions, and unpredictable events all contribute to the flow of oil in the world market. Congress may consider policies that affect the world oil market, including sanctions, alternative fuel standards, emission controls, use of electric vehicles, and protection of international trade routes. This report provides an introduction to the U.S. and world oil markets, with an overview of supply and demand, price considerations, and trade flows. The report also includes analysis on selected examples of international conditions that in the past have affected policy decisions in the United States.

    "crs_R44670": "The Social Security full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which workers can first claim full Social Security retired-worker benefits. Among other factors, the age at which an individual begins receiving Social Security benefits has an impact on the size of the monthly benefits. Claiming benefits before the FRA can substantially reduce monthly benefits, whereas claiming benefits after the FRA can lead to a substantial increase in monthly benefits. Benefit adjustments are made based on the number of months before or after the FRA the worker claims benefits. The adjustments are intended to result in roughly the same total lifetime benefits, regardless of when the worker claims benefits, based on average life expectancy. The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. As part of legislation enacted in 1983, the FRA is increasing gradually from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period that started for those who turned age 62 in 2000. The increase in the FRA will be fully phased in (the FRA will reach 67) for workers born in 1960 or later (i.e., for workers who become eligible for retirement benefits at age 62 in 2022). For workers who become eligible for retirement benefits in 2019 (i.e., workers born in 1957), the FRA is 66 and 6 months. Workers can claim Social Security retired-worker benefits as early as age 62, the early eligibility age (EEA). However, workers who claim benefits before the FRA are subject to a permanent reduction in their benefits. Spouses can also claim reduced retirement benefits as early as age 62. Other types of dependents can claim benefits before the age of 62. Workers who claim benefits after the FRA receive a delayed retirement credit that results in a permanent increase in their monthly benefits. The credit applies up to the age of 70. Claiming benefits after attainment of age 70 does not result in any further increase in monthly benefits. The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. It remained 65 until 1983, when Congress included an increase in the FRA among many provisions in the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which were designed to address serious near-term and long-range financing problems. The 1983 Amendments became law on April 20, 1983. Without legislative action, it was anticipated that Social Security benefits could not be paid on time beginning in July 1983. The 1983 provision that increased the FRA from 65 to 67 continues to be phased in; it will be fully phased in by 2022. The Social Security system once again faces projected long-range funding shortfalls. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects that full Social Security benefits can be paid on time until 2034 with a combination of annual Social Security tax revenues and asset reserves held by the Social Security trust funds. After the projected depletion of trust fund reserves in 2034, however, annual tax revenues are projected to cover about three-fourths of benefits scheduled under current law. Over the years, deficit reduction commissions and other policymakers have recommended an increase in the Social Security retirement age. The recent proposals, for example, included the S.O.S. Act of 2016 (H.R. 5747, the 114th Congress), which proposed increasing the FRA among other changes. Under the proposal, after the FRA reaches 67 for those attaining 62 in 2022, the FRA would increase by two months per year until the FRA reaches 69 for those attaining 62 in 2034. Thereafter, the FRA would increase one month every year. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) projects that this option would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 39% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall (based on the 2018 Annual Report of the Social Security Board of Trustees, intermediate assumptions). Another recent proposal from the Bipartisan Policy Center in 2016 recommended, among other changes, to increase the FRA by one month every two years after the FRA reaches 67 for those attaining age 62 in 2022 until the FRA reaches 69, and also increase the age up to which the delayed retirement credit may be earned at the same rate (from 70 to 72). This option contains no change in the EEA. OCACT estimates that this option would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 15% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall (based on the 2018 Annual Report of the Social Security Board of Trustees, intermediate assumptions).",
    "crs_RL33487": "In March 2011, antigovernment protests broke out in Syria, which has been ruled by the Asad family for more than four decades. The protests spread, violence escalated (primarily but not exclusively by Syrian government forces), and numerous political and armed opposition groups emerged. In August 2011, President Barack Obama called on Syrian President Bashar al Asad to step down. Over time, the rising death toll from the conflict, and the use of chemical weapons by the Asad government, intensified pressure for the United States and others to assist the opposition. In 2013, Congress debated lethal and nonlethal assistance to vetted Syrian opposition groups, and authorized the latter. In 2014, the Obama Administration requested authority and funding from Congress to provide lethal support to vetted Syrians for select purposes. The original request sought authority to support vetted Syrians in \"defending the Syrian people from attacks by the Syrian regime,\" but the subsequent advance of the Islamic State organization from Syria across Iraq refocused executive and legislative deliberations onto counterterrorism. Congress authorized a Department of Defense-led train and equip program to combat terrorist groups active in Syria, defend the United States and its partners from Syria-based terrorist threats, and \"promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria.\" In September 2014, the United States began air strikes in Syria, with the stated goal of preventing the Islamic State from using Syria as a base for its operations in neighboring Iraq. In October 2014, the Defense Department established Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) to \"formalize ongoing military actions against the rising threat posed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\" CJTF-OIR came to encompass more than 70 countries, and has bolstered the efforts of local Syrian partner forces against the Islamic State. The United States also gradually increased the number of U.S. personnel in Syria from 50 in late 2015 to roughly 2,000 by late 2017. President Trump in early 2018 called for an expedited withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, but senior Administration officials later stated that U.S. personnel would remain in Syria to ensure the enduring defeat of the Islamic State. National Security Advisor John Bolton also stated that U.S. forces would remain in Syria until the withdrawal of Iranian-led forces. In December 2018, President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria, contributing to the subsequent decision by Defense Secretary James Mattis to resign, and drawing criticism from several Members of Congress. In early 2019, the White House announced that several hundred U.S. troops would remain in Syria. The collapse of IS and opposition territorial control in most of Syria since 2015 has been matched by significant military and territorial gains by the Syrian government. The U.S. intelligence community's 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment stated in February 2018 that, \"The conflict has decisively shifted in the Syrian regime's favor, enabling Russia and Iran to further entrench themselves inside the country.\" At the same time, ongoing conflict between the coalition's Syrian Kurdish partners and Turkey has continued to challenge U.S. policymakers, as has the entrenchment of Al Qaeda-affiliated groups among the opposition and the ongoing humanitarian crisis. As of 2019, 5.7 million Syrians are registered as refugees in nearby countries, with 6.2 million more internally displaced. The U.N. has sponsored peace talks in Geneva since 2012, but it is unclear when (or whether) the parties might reach a political settlement that could result in a transition away from Asad. With many armed opposition groups weakened, defeated, or geographically isolated, military pressure on the Syrian government to make concessions to the opposition has been reduced. U.S. officials have stated that the United States will not fund reconstruction in Asad-held areas unless a political solution is reached in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254. The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syria crisis, drawing from existing funding from global humanitarian accounts and some reprogrammed funding. As of March 2019, total U.S. humanitarian assistance for the Syria crisis had reached more than $9.5 billion. Of this total, roughly $4.7 billion has gone toward meeting humanitarian needs inside Syria, while the remainder has supported host communities in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt that host Syrian refugees. The Trump Administration's FY2020 foreign assistance budget request assumes for budgeting purposes that more than 7,000 U.S. military personnel will be deployed to Iraq and Syria in FY2020. It is unclear whether USAID and State Department personnel will redeploy to Syria to spearhead stabilization projects. The Administration's FY2020 foreign assistance request states that the United States will seek to \"leverage\" additional partner contributions",
    "crs_R41136": "The Republic of Cyprus gained its independence from Great Britain in 1960. At the time, the population living on the island was approximately 77% Greek ethnic origin and roughly 18% Turkish ethnic origin. The two major communities aspired to different futures for Cyprus: most Greek Cypriots favored union of the entire island with Greece (enosis), whereas Turkish Cypriots preferred to partition the island and possibly unite the Turkish Cypriot zone with Turkey. The two communities also differed on the means of achieving a federation: Greek Cypriots wanted their internationally recognized national government to devolve power to the Turkish Cypriots, who would then rejoin a Cypriot republic. For the Turkish Cypriots, two entities would join, for the first time, in a new federation. These differences in views also affected the resolution of issues such as property claims, citizenship of mainland Turks who had settled on the island, and other legal issues. These differences in views continue to plague the negotiations today. The Annan Plan for a settlement of the Cyprus problem appeared to take a dramatic and positive step forward when on November 11, 2002, then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented a draft of \"The Basis for Agreement on a Comprehensive Settlement of the Cyprus Problem,\" commonly referred to as the Annan Plan. The plan called for, among many provisions, a \"common state\" government with a single international legal personality that would participate in foreign and European Union relations. Two politically equal component states would address much of the daily responsibilities of government in their respective communities. The Annan Plan itself was revised several times in an attempt to reach compromises demanded by both sides. Complicating the matter even more, on April 16, 2003, the Republic of Cyprus signed an accession treaty with the European Union (EU), whether or not there was a settlement and a reunited Cyprus. Finally, after numerous meetings and negotiations, and despite a lack of a firm agreement but sensing that further negotiations would produce little else, on March 29, 2004, Secretary-General Kofi Annan released his \"final revised plan\" and announced that the plan would be put to referenda simultaneously in both north and south Cyprus on April 24, 2004. The Turkish Cypriot leadership split, with Denktash urging rejection and Talat urging support. Greek Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, a long-time acquaintance of Christofias, declared that \"a solution in Cyprus is possible by the end of 2008.\" He also declared that \"the goal was to establish a new partnership state in Cyprus, based on the political equality of the two peoples and the equal status of two constituent states.\" The negotiations between Christofias and Talat appeared to get off to a fast start, but the differences quickly became apparent, and the talks, although held on a regular basis, soon began to bog down. Talat wanted to pursue negotiations on the basis of the provisions of the Annan Plan, while Christofias, mindful of the Greek Cypriot rejection of that plan, was keen to avoid references to it.

Each year, the foreign aid budget is the subject of congressional debate over the size, composition, and purpose of the program. The focus of U.S. foreign aid policy has been transformed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Global development, a major objective of foreign aid, has been cited as a third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy, in the national security strategies of the George W.

    "crs_R45463": "The federal government collects various fees and other charges from businesses and households. Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. By contrast, the collection of taxes ultimately relies on the government's sovereign power to compel payments. Fees may not be compulsory, but not paying them may make it impossible to carry out many activities legally. For example, without paying passport application fees and obtaining a passport, people cannot fly to other countries. Nor can businesses issue securities without paying federal filing fees. The statutory basis for each particular fee or user charge varies in specificity and in the degree of discretion granted to the executive branch. For example, authorizing legislation might specify in detail how certain fees are imposed and how proceeds are used. In other cases, federal agencies rely on broader authorities to impose user fees. User fees have several advantages as a means of financing public activities. They are voluntary, they connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and they can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. At times, proposals to raise fees may encounter less political resistance than proposals to raise an equivalent sum via taxes. On the other hand, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, which may complicate the financing of government operations. Some are also concerned that funding arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse.

Choosing to raise public funds via user fees, as opposed to other means such as taxes, has important administrative and economic consequences. Many fees stem from \"business-like activities,\" in which the government provides a service or benefit in return for payment. For example, many entry fees charge entry fees, which then help fund maintenance projects. Some fees are closely tied to regulatory or judicial activities, such as filing or inspection fees, which stem from the federal government's sovereign powers. Other federal fees or charges are intragovernmental transactions that do not involve the public. For example, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) charges other federal agencies fees to cover the cost of background investigations. For many federal agencies, fees or user charges amount to a minimal portion of budgetary resources. Other regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), are wholly or partially funded by user fees and other nontax receipts.

Sources may vary in their totals due to differences in how federal workforce statistics are compiled. Some sources rely on \"head counts\" of employees (OPM), some on total hours worked (such as the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]), some on surveys of employing agencies, and others on self-identification by workers surveyed in their homes. In addition, federal civilian employee databases may exclude particular departments, agencies, or branches of government. Some may also account for temporary or seasonal employees (such as those employed by the U.S. Census) depending on the time of year the statistics are generated.

    "crs_R45618": "The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is one such example of a twentieth-century delegation of emergency authority. One of 123 emergency statutes under the umbrella of the National Emergencies Act (NEA), IEEPA grants the President extensive power to regulate a variety of economic transactions during a state of emergency. Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977 to rein in the expansive emergency economic powers that it had been delegated to the President under the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Nevertheless, some scholars argue that judicial and legislative actions subsequent to IEEPA's enactment have made it, like TWEA, a source of expansive and unchecked executive authority in the economic realm. Others, however, argue that Presidents often use IEEPA to implement the will of Congress either as directed by law or as encouraged by congressional activity. Until recently, there has been little congressional discussion of modifying either IEEPA or its umbrella statute, the NEA. Recent presidential actions, however, have drawn attention to presidential emergency powers under the NEA of which IEEPA is the most frequently used. Should Congress consider changing IEEPA, there are two issues that Congress may wish to address. The first pertains to how Congress has delegated its authority under IEEPA and its umbrella statute, the NEA. The second pertains to choices made in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018.

    "crs_R42565": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; venture capital programs, including the now inactive New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) program, to foster small business expansion; programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loans for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and access to entrepreneurial education to assist with business formation and expansion. Authorized by P.L. 106-554, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (Appendix H: the New Markets Venture Capital Program Act of 2000), the NMVC program is designed to promote economic development and the creation of wealth and job opportunities in low-income geographic areas and among individuals living in such areas by encouraging developmental venture capital investments in smaller enterprises primarily located in such areas; and address the unmet equity investment needs of small enterprises located in low-income geographic areas. Modeled on the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, SBA-selected, privately owned and managed NMVC companies provide funding and operational assistance to small businesses. To do so, they use private capital the NMVC company has raised (called regulatory capital) and up to 150% of that amount (called leverage) from the sale of SBA-guaranteed 10-year debentures, or loan obligations, to third parties, subject to the availability of funds. Because the SBA guarantees the debenture, the SBA is able to obtain favorable interest rates. NMVC companies are responsible for meeting the terms and conditions set forth in the debenture. At least 80% of the investments must be in small businesses located in a low-income area, as defined in the statute. Specialized Small Business Investment Companies (SSBICs) established under the SBIC program are also eligible for NMVC operational assistance grants, which are awarded on a dollar-to-dollar matching basis. Six NMVC companies participated in the program. The NMVC program was appropriated $21.952 million in FY2001 to support up to $150 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures and up to $30 million for operational assistance grants for FY2001 through FY2006. The funds were provided in a lump sum in FY2001 and were to remain available until expended. The SBA subsequently provided $72.0 million in leverage to NMVC companies in FY2002 and FY2003 ($12.5 million in FY2002 and $59.5 million in FY2003) and $14.4 million for operational assistance grants ($3.75 million in FY2002 and $10.65 million in FY2003). In 2003, the unobligated balances of $10.5 million for NMVC debenture subsidies and $13.75 million for operational assistance grants were rescinded. The program continued to operate, with the number and amount of financing declining in recent years as the program's initial investments expired and NMVC companies increasingly engaged only in additional follow-on financings with the small businesses in their portfolios. The NMVC program's active unpaid principal balance (which is comprised of the SBA guaranteed portion and the unguaranteed portion of the NMVC companies' unpaid principal balance) peaked at $698 million in FY2008, and then fell each year thereafter until reaching $0 in FY2018. No bills have been introduced since the 112th Congress concerning the NMVC program. However, more than 30 bills were introduced in previous Congresses to either expand or amend the program. Many of these bills would have increased the program's funding (a list and summary of bills introduced by Congress to provide the program additional funding appears in the Appendix). For example, during the 112th Congress, H.R. 2872, the Job Creation and Urban Revitalization Act of 2011, would have provided the NMVC program such subsidy budget authority as may be necessary to guarantee $75 million of debentures and $15 million for operational assistance grants for FY2012 through FY2013.

There is also a contingency fund available that provides extra federal funds to states that meet certain conditions. Additionally, states are required to spend at least 75% of what they spent in FY1994 on TANF's predecessor programs. The minimum MOE amount, in total, is $10.3 billion per year for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. The TANF block grant is funded through a combination of federal and state funds. In FY2018, TANF has two federal grants to states. The bulk of the TANF funding is in a basic block grant to the states, totaling $16.5 billion for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Indian tribes.

The minimum MOE amount, in total, is $10.3 billion per year for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. The TANF block grant is also a major contributor to child care funding. In FY2017, $5 billion (16% of all TANF and MOE funds) were either expended on child care or transferred to the child care block grant (the Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF). TANF work-related activities (including education and training) were the third-largest TANF and MOE spending category at $3.3 billion, or 11% of total TANF and MOE funds. TANF is also a major contributor to the child welfare system, which provides foster care, adoption assistance, and services to families with children who either have experienced or are at risk of experiencing child abuse or neglect, spending about $2.2 billion on such activities. TANF and MOE funds are also used for short-term and emergency benefits and a wide range of other social services.

    "crs_RL31693": "The President and Congress have historically played different roles when sending U.S. troops into hostile situations. The President has the power under Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution to use the Armed Forces to repel attacks. Congress under Article I, Section 8, has the power to declare war and raise and support the Armed Forces. The War Powers Resolution was enacted to ensure that the President and Congress share decisions where U.S. troops may become involved in hostilities. This sharing of power has often resulted in controversy, particularly when troops are sent into situations where there has not been a formal declaration of war. In most instances, Congress has used its legislative prerogatives through funding mechanisms or declarations of policy either to affirm or to place limits on presidential action. In three instances, Congress has authorized the use of military force in advance of hostilities: the Persian Gulf War (1991), military operations in Afghanistan (2001), and the \"use of force against Iraq\" resolution (2002). In each case, however, the President has maintained that while he may have sought congressional consultation and support, the President has the constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to use force, including the Armed Forces of the United States, to protect U.S. national security interests. Additionally, the executive branch has long viewed congressional enactment of defense appropriations bills as de facto authorization for operations funded under those measures, although Congress has often included provisions stating that no separate authorization for the use of force is implied by the appropriation of funds.

Whereas populist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez (1998-2013) governed during a period of generally high oil prices, his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), has exacerbated an economic downturn caused by low global oil prices through mismanagement and corruption. According to Freedom House, Venezuela has fallen from \"partly free\" under Ch\u00e1vez to \"not free\" under Maduro, an unpopular leader who has violently quashed dissent and illegally replaced the legislature with a National Constituent Assembly (ANC) elected under controversial circumstances in July 2017. President Maduro won reelection in early elections held in May 2018 that were dismissed as illegitimate by the democratically elected, opposition-controlled National Assembly and much of the international community. U.S. relations with Venezuela, a major oil supplier, deteriorated during Ch\u00e1vez's rule, which undermined human rights, the separation of powers, and freedom of expression. U.S. and regional concerns have deepened as the Maduro government has manipulated democratic institutions; cracked down on the opposition, media, and civil society; engaged in drug trafficking and corruption; and refused most humanitarian aid. Efforts to hasten a return to democracy in Venezuela have failed thus far.

    "crs_RL32665": "On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal is the largest force-level goal that the Navy has released since a 375-ship force-level goal that was in place in 2002-2004. In the years between that 375-ship goal and the 355-ship goal, Navy force-level goals were generally in the low 300s. The force level of 355 ships is a goal to be attained in the future; the actual size of the Navy in recent years has generally been between 270 and 290 ships. The Navy states that a new Force Structure Assessment (FSA) is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA, and that this new FSA is to be completed by the end of 2019. The new FSA, Navy officials state, will take into account the Trump Administration's December 2017 National Security Strategy document and its January 2018 National Defense Strategy document, both of which put an emphasis on renewed great power competition with China and Russia, as well as updated information on Chinese and Russian naval and other military capabilities and recent developments in new technologies, including those related to unmanned vehicles (UVs). Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. Some observers, viewing statements by Navy officials, believe the new FSA in particular might shift the Navy's surface force to a more distributed architecture that includes a reduced proportion of large surface combatants (i.e., cruisers and destroyers), an increased proportion of small surface combatants (i.e., frigates and Littoral Combat Ships), and a newly created third tier of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Some observers believe the new FSA might also change the Navy's undersea force to a more distributed architecture that includes, in addition to attack submarines (SSNs) and bottom-based sensors, a new element of extremely large unmanned underwater vehicles (XLUUVs), which might be thought of as unmanned submarines. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans.

Major disaster declarations also authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grant assistance to state, local, and tribal governments, residences, and certain private nonprofit (PNP) facilities that provide critical services. Businesses that suffer uninsured loss as a result of a major disaster declaration are not eligible for FEMA grant assistance, and grant assistance from other federal sources is limited. On some occasions, Congress has provided assistance to businesses through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.

In a few cases, CDBG has also been used to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues. CDBG assistance, however, is not available for all major disasters. Rather, it is used by Congress on a case-by-case basis in response to large-scale disasters. The United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce are also authorized to provide assistance to certain types of businesses such as agricultural producers or fisheries. While these programs are important sources of assistance following a disaster, they are generally limited in scope (available for only certain types of businesses) or provide limited grant amounts. Most businesses will need to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan if they want assistance from the federal government for uninsured loss resulting from a disaster. SBA is authorized to provide grants to SBA resource partners, including Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, and SCORE (formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives), to provide training and other technical assistance to small businesses affected by a disaster, but is not authorized to provide direct grant assistance to businesses. The long-standing policy of providing disaster loans for businesses instead of grants has been reexamined by Congress in the last decade. In recent Congresses, legislation has been introduced that would establish business disaster grant programs. These legislative attempts include: (1) the Small Business Owner Disaster Relief Act of 2008 (H.R. 6641) in the 110th Congress, and (2) the Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act (H.R. 3930) in the 115th Congress.

The ANC, the majority party in parliament, replaced Zuma with then-Vice President Ramaphosa, whom the ANC elected as its leader in late 2017. Zuma had faced intense pressure to step down after years of weak economic growth and multiple corruption scandals under his tenure. Ramaphosa is leading a reform agenda to address these challenges.

South Africa also opposed the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw the United States from",
    "crs_R44477": "Federal policymakers statutorily established the U.S. Department of Education (ED) as a Cabinet-level agency in 1980. Its mission is to \"promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.\" Like most federal agencies, ED receives funds in support of its mission through various federal budget and appropriations processes. These processes are complex. For example, ED receives both mandatory and discretionary appropriations; ED is annually provided forward funds and advance appropriations for some\u2014but not all\u2014discretionary programs; ED awards both formula and competitive grants; and a portion of ED's budget subsidizes student loan costs (through both direct loans and loan guarantees). Because of this complexity, analyzing ED's budget requires an understanding of a broad range of federal budget and appropriations concepts. This report provides an introduction to these concepts as they are used specifically in the context of the congressional appropriations process for ED. It was designed for readers who are new or returning to the topic of ED budget and appropriations. The first section of this report provides an introduction to key terms and concepts in the federal budget and appropriations process with special relevance for ED. The second section answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about federal funding for the department, as well as closely related questions about education funding in general. The third section includes a brief description of, and links to, reports and documents that provide more information about budget and appropriations concepts. The scope of this report is generally (but not exclusively) limited to concepts associated with funding provided to ED through the annual appropriations process. It does not address all possible sources of federal funding for education, training, or related activities. For example, it does not seek to address education tax credits, student loans, or education and training programs at agencies other than ED. Where this report does address such topics, it does so in order to provide broad context for questions and key terms related to the appropriations process for ED. This report also addresses some frequently asked questions about education funding in general.",
    "crs_RL31572": "Article I, Section 9, of the U.S. Constitution provides, \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" The Constitution does not, however, prescribe any specific structure or process for making appropriations. The committee structure established by Congress during the 20th century assigns a prominent role to the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate for both the development of appropriations legislation and oversight over budget execution. The Appropriations Committees, in turn, have created a system of subcommittees designed to facilitate their ability to carry out these tasks. The number and jurisdictions of appropriations subcommittees have evolved to meet changing needs and circumstances. For example, reorganization was undertaken at the beginning of the 108th Congress in response to the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security. After the legislation establishing the new department was enacted, the House Appropriations Committee established a new subcommittee. This modification of subcommittee structure affected eight of the existing subcommittees and was one of the most extensive reorganizations of the Appropriations Committees since the 1920s. Shortly thereafter, a similar change was made in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Reorganization can also be undertaken to adapt to changes in congressional priorities. For example, in the reorganization that occurred at the start of the 109th Congress, both the House and the Senate undertook a major change in subcommittee structure. This resulted in the elimination of three appropriations subcommittees in the House and one in the Senate and ultimately affected the jurisdictions of 10 appropriations subcommittees in the House and 8 in the Senate. Another major reorganization at the beginning of the 110th Congress again shifted subcommittee jurisdiction to reestablish parallel House and Senate subcommittees. This report details the evolution of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees' subcommittee structure from the 1920s to the present.",
    "crs_RL33388": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency committee that serves the President in overseeing the national security implications of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the economy. Since its inception, CFIUS has operated at the nexus of shifting concepts of national security and major changes in technology, especially relative to various notions of national eco nomic security, and a changing global economic order that is marked in part by emerging economies such as China that are playing a more active role in the global economy. As a basic premise, the U.S. historical approach to international investment has aimed to establish an open and rules-based international economic system that is consistent across countries and in line with U.S. economic and national security interests. This policy also has fundamentally maintained that FDI has positive net benefits for the U.S. and global economy, except in certain cases in which national security concerns outweigh other considerations and for prudential reasons. Recently, some policymakers argued that certain foreign investment transactions, particularly by entities owned or controlled by a foreign government, investments with leading-edge or foundational technologies, or investments that may compromise personally identifiable information, are affecting U.S. national economic security. As a result, they supported greater CFIUS scrutiny of foreign investment transactions, including a mandatory approval process for some transactions. Some policymakers also argued that the CFIUS review process should have a more robust economic component, possibly even to the extent of an industrial policy-type approach that uses the CFIUS national security review process to protect and promote certain industrial sectors in the economy. Others argued, however, that the CFIUS review process should be expanded to include certain transactions that had not previously been reviewed, but that CFIUS' overall focus should remain fairly narrow. In 2018, Congress and the Trump Administration adopted the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), Subtitle A of Title XVII of P.L. 115-232 (Aug. 13, 2018), which became effective on November 11, 2018. The impetus for FIRRMA was based on concerns that ''the national security landscape has shifted in recent years, and so has the nature of the investments that pose the greatest potential risk to national security....'' As a result, FIRRMA provided for some programs to become effective upon passage, while a pilot program was developed to address immediate concerns relative to other provisions and allow time for additional resources to be directed at developing a more permanent response in these areas. Interim rules for the pilot program developed by the Treasury Department cover an expanded scope of transactions subject to a review by CFIUS to include noncontrolling investments by foreign persons in U.S. firms involved in critical technologies. A second part of the pilot program implements FIRRMA's mandatory declarations provision for all transactions that fall within the specific scope of the pilot program. The pilot program is to end no later than March 5, 2020. Upon enactment, FIRRMA: (1) expanded the scope and jurisdiction of CFIUS by redefining such terms as \"covered transactions\" and \"critical technologies\"; (2) refined CFIUS procedures, including timing for reviews and investigations; and (3) required actions by CFIUS to address national security risks related to mitigation agreements, among other areas. Treasury's interim rules updated and amended existing regulations in order to implement certain provisions immediately. FIRRMA also required CFIUS to take certain actions within prescribed deadlines for various programs, reporting, and other plans. FIRRMA also broadened CFIUS' mandate by explicitly including for review certain real estate transactions in close proximity to a military installation or U.S. government facility or property of national security sensitivities. In addition, FIRRMA: provides for CFIUS to review any noncontrolling investment in U.S. businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, or collecting sensitive data on U.S. citizens; any change in foreign investor rights; transactions in which a foreign government has a direct or indirect substantial interest; and any transaction or arrangement designed to evade CFIUS. Through a \"sense of Congress\" provision in FIRRMA, CFIUS reviews potentially can discriminate among investors from certain countries that are determined to be a country of \"special concern\" (specified through additional regulations) that has a \"demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect U.S. leadership in areas related to national security.\" FIRRMA also broadened CFIUS' mandate by explicitly including for review certain real estate transactions in close proximity to a military installation or U.S. government facility or property of national security sensi",
    "crs_R43327": "The federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure in three different ways. First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. Second, Congress has authorized airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, subject to specific federal approval. PFC revenues can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds, including \"landside\" projects such as passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Third, federal law grants investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements (subject to compliance with federal rules). Airports may also draw on state and local funds and on operating revenues, such as lease payments and landing fees. A federal role in airport infrastructure first developed during World War II. Prior to the war, airports were a local or private responsibility, with federal support limited to the tax exclusion of municipal bond interest. National defense needs led to the first major federal support for airport construction. After the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-377) continued federal ad, although at lower levels than during the war years. Initially, much of this spending supported conversion of military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s, substantial funding also was used to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets. In 1970, Congress responded to increasing congestion, both in the air and on the ground at U.S. airports, by passing two laws. The first, the Airport and Airway Development Act, established the forerunner programs of AIP: the Airport Development Aid Program and the Planning Grant Program. The second, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, dealt with the revenue side of airport development, establishing the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, also referred to as the Aviation Trust Fund, and in this report, the trust fund). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. The main financial advantage of AIP to airports is that, as a grant program, it can provide funds for capital projects without the financial burden of debt financing, although airports are required to provide a modest local match to the federal funds. Limitations on the use of AIP grants include the range of projects that AIP can fund and the requirement that recipients adhere to all program regulations and grant assurances. The federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure in three different ways. First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways.

    "crs_R45268": "This report describes and analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2019. It compares the enacted FY2018 appropriations for DHS, the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request, and the appropriations measures developed and considered by Congress in response to it. This report identifies additional informational resources, reports, and products on DHS appropriations that provide context for the discussion, and it provides a list of Congressional Research Service (CRS) policy experts with whom clients may consult on specific topics. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts. These reports do not provide in-depth analysis of specific issues related to mandatory funding\u2014such as retirement pay\u2014nor do they systematically follow other legislation related to the authorizing or amending of DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. Discussion of appropriations legislation involves a variety of specialized budgetary concepts. The Appendix to this report explains several of these concepts, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25). The Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2019, as part of an overall budget that the Office of Management and Budget estimated to be $74.88 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not annually appropriated or does not score against discretionary budget limits). The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). The Trump Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25) and is not reflected in the above totals. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the BCA, and in the budget request for the Department of Defense, $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding (OCO), to be transferred to the Coast Guard. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. This bill was never taken up for action on the House floor. On February 14, 2019, the House took up H.J.Res. 31, a consolidated appropriations bill that included eight annual appropriations bills. Division A, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.69 billion (3.5%) more than had been provided for FY2018, and $2.04 billion more than had been requested by the Administration in February 2018. In addition to that total, the bill included $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters\u2014$5.35 billion (80.4%) more than had been requested, and the requested $165 million in OCO funding appropriated for the Coast Guard operating budget, rather than a transfer from the Navy. The bill passed the House by a vote of 300-128, and the Senate that same day by a vote of 83-16. The President signed it into law the next day.",
    "crs_R45696": "This report summarizes and analyzes selected forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress and compares them with prior law or policy. These provisions were enacted through two legislative vehicles The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act, enacted as Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) and signed into law on March 23, 2018. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334, Title VIII), signed into law on December 20, 2018. This law is commonly referred to as the 2018 farm bill. Both laws included provisions that address forest management through three general perspectives: (1) management of forested federal land, (2) federal programs to support forest management on nonfederal lands, known as forest assistance programs, and (3) programs to promote or conduct forestry research (to benefit both federal and nonfederal forests). This report focuses primarily on the provisions related to management of forested federal land. The federal forest management provisions change how the Forest Service (FS, within the Department of Agriculture (USDA)) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM, within the Department of the Interior (DOI)) manage their lands. FS is responsible for managing the 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS), and BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands under its jurisdiction. FS is authorized to identify eligible NFS areas for designation as insect and disease treatment areas, prioritize projects in those designated areas, and plan and implement those projects through a potentially expedited process. In some states, all eligible lands were designated. In those states, the expedited project planning procedures are thus broadly available, but any prioritization benefit is effectively nullified. The 115th Congress enacted provisions that affect how FS and BLM implement those activities and procedural requirements. The report summarizes and analyzes the provisions in the following categories: project planning and implementation, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous. Within each of those categories, the report broadly discusses relevant issues, summarizes the changes made in the 115th Congress, and discusses potential issues for Congress related to that category. Some provisions or sections are covered in more depth than others, generally reflecting the complexity of the issue, nature of the enacted changes, or level of congressional interest. A separate section at the end of the report discusses overall issues for Congress. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing all of the forest-related provisions in each law to prior law (including provisions related to forestry assistance programs and forestry research).",
    "crs_R41364": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Among the expiring tax provisions was a lower 15% rate for long-term capital gains and dividends, with a 0% tax rate on capital gains and dividends for taxpayers subject to ordinary rates of 15% or less. Absent legislative action, capital gains tax rates would have reverted to pre-2003 rates of 20% and 10% (18% and 8% for assets held for five years or more), and dividends would be taxed at ordinary rates. The highest ordinary tax rate is currently 35% but, absent change, will rise to 39.6%. President Obama proposed in both his budget outlines (FY2010 and FY2011) to retain the 15% and 0% rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but to tax both dividends and capital gains at 20% for married couples with income of $250,000 or more and single taxpayers with income of $200,000 or more. The tax rates were temporarily extended through the end of 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312). The final resolution at the beginning of 2013 (American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, P.L. 112-240) was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals at the higher rate, but at incomes of $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018, considerably higher than those proposed by President Obama. Compared with most other tax provisions, the potential revenue gain scored for an increase in capital gains taxes is strongly affected by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Department of the Treasury. As an illustration, the Obama Administration estimated in February 2010 that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion of revenue in FY2019. Yet, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections in January 2010, the current effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019; applying the differential in these rates to the realizations in 2019 would have produced a revenue difference of $40 billion. Although some of this differential could arise from different forecasts, assumptions about behavioral responses are the main reason for the reduction in projected revenues. To address these potential behavioral responses, some supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains (given that such gains comprise a significant part of the income of high-income individuals) have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued, which would eliminate the realization response for affected assets. Assets that are less easily valued could be subject to look-back treatment, which would increase the tax to achieve the same after-tax earnings that would have occurred if the tax were imposed on an accrual basis. Such an approach has a number of complexities, and to the extent that these changes aim to address the behavioral response, it is important to understand the limits this behavioral assumption imposes on options for increasing taxes on realized capital gains and the empirical basis for these estimated effects. The analysis in this report suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT, absent a change in their realizations response, may likely understate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. The range of realizations elasticities, even if confined to time series estimates, is very broad for revenue-estimating purposes or otherwise evaluating capital gains taxes. Researchers turned their attention to methods to produce more precise and reliable estimates. One important event that influenced thinking about these elasticities was the sharp spike in realizations that occurred in 1986. Between 1985 and 1986, realizations rose from $170.6 billion to $324.4 billion, falling to $144.2 billion in 1987. A study of this phenomenon using taxpayer data showed that these gains occurred in December, and were seven times the gains in December of the previous year. This increase, which took place when a tax increase was passed for the following years, was evidence of the magnitude of transitory realizations responses and contributed further to concerns about the reflection of transitory responses in the econometric studies. Elasticities are expected to be negative but are often reported without the minus sign (and will be in this report). The higher the value of the elasticity, the smaller the revenue gain or loss from a capital gains tax increase or decrease. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if the elasticity is greater than one, the tax increase loses revenue. For a small increase in tax rates, the ratio of revenue gain projected to the gain realized with no behavioral response (static gain) is one minus the elasticity. Thus, if the elasticity is 0.25, 75% of the static revenue gain will be realized",
    "crs_R40482": "The annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations legislation (SFOPS) funds many of the nondefense international affairs activities of the government. It is one of 12 appropriations bills that Congress considers annually to fund the discretionary activities of the government. Congress structures SFOPS into several titles, which consist of broad spending categories. These titles are subdivided into paragraphs that each address one component account, a funding line item that includes one or several activities of the government. A single component account may cover one agency's entire annual budget, grant funds to an independent organization, or fund multiple activities associated with statutory authorities, among other things. In the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6), the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act (Division F) is divided into eight titles, each associated with the following activities: Many of the component accounts within these titles correspond to one or several authorities in statute. Major acts in Title 22 include the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (P.L. 84-885; hereinafter the Basic Authorities Act), the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-465), and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195; hereinafter the FAA), among others. This report identifies the statutory authorities that enable each component account to function. A list of these major acts, and cross-references to their location in the U.S. Code, are in Appendix A.

    "crs_RL33243": "Established in 1953, the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) origins can be traced to the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II, when concerns about unemployment and war production were paramount. The SBA assumed some of the functions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which had been created by the federal government in 1932 to provide funding for businesses of all sizes during the Depression and later financed war production. During the early 1950s, the RFC was disbanded following charges of political favoritism in the granting of loans and contracts. In 1953, Congress passed the Small Business Act (P.L. 83-163), which authorized the SBA. The act specifies that the SBA's mission is to promote the interests of small businesses to enhance competition in the private marketplace: It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation. The SBA currently administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Many Members of Congress also regularly receive constituent inquiries about the SBA's programs. This report provides an overview of the SBA's programs and funding. It also references other CRS reports that examine the SBA's programs in greater detail. The SBA's FY2020 congressional budget justification document includes funding and program costs for the following programs and offices: 1. entrepreneurial development programs (including Small Business Development Centers, Women's Business Centers, SCORE, Entrepreneurial Education, Native American Outreach, PRIME, the State Trade Expansion Program, and veterans' programs); 2. disaster assistance; 3. capital access programs (including the 7(a) loan guaranty program, the 504/Certified Development Company [CDC] loan guaranty program, the Microloan program, International Trade and Export Promotion programs, and lender oversight); 4. contracting programs (including the 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance program, the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development program, the Historically Underutilized Business Zones [HUBZones] program, the Prime Contract Assistance program, the Women's Business program, the Subcontracting program, and the Surety Bond Guarantee program); 5. regional and district offices (counseling, training, and outreach services); 6. the Office of Inspector General (OIG); 7. capital investment programs (including the Small Business Investment Company [SBIC] program, the New Market Venture Capital program, the Small Business Innovation Research [SBIR] program, the Small Business Technology Transfer program [STTR], and growth accelerators); 8. the Office of Advocacy; and 9. executive direction programs (the National Women's Business Council, Office of Ombudsman, and Faith-Based Initiatives).",
    "crs_R44857": "The Constitution gives no direct role to Congress in conducting federal law enforcement. While Congress enjoys the legislative power under Article I of the Constitution, which includes substantial authority to investigate the executive branch pursuant to its oversight function, criminal investigations and prosecutions are generally considered core executive functions entrusted with the executive branch un der Article II. Because of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise when the executive branch investigates itself, however, there have often been calls for prosecutors with independence from the executive branch. In response, Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have used both statutory and regulatory mechanisms to establish a process for such inquiries. These responses have attempted, in different ways, to balance the competing goals of independence and accountability with respect to inquiries of executive branch officials. This report first analyzes the use of special prosecutors and independent counsels that were authorized under now-expired provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as well as the use of special counsels that are currently authorized by DOJ regulations. A glossary of terms at the beginning of the report briefly defines these italicized terms. The report continues with an examination of various legal questions relevant to these efforts. As a threshold matter, some have challenged the appointment of a special counsel under the current regulations as unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause. More broadly, designing a statutory framework for criminal investigations and prosecutions with independence from the executive branch raises questions about how this can be achieved consistent with the requirements of the Constitution. For instance, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the since-expired independent counsel statute in the 1988 case of Morrison v. Olson, but has not applied the reasoning of Morrison in subsequent cases raising related issues. The constitutional status of a statutory framework analogous to the independent counsel statute is thus subject to debate. Several bills introduced in the 116th Congress (including S. 71 and H.R. 197, which merge aspects of two preceding bills introduced in the 115th Congress, S. 1735 and S. 1741) statutorily insulate a special counsel from removal, echoing aspects of the independent counsel statute's provisions. Whether such proposals would withstand constitutional challenge today might ultimately turn on the continued vitality of the analysis applied in Morrison.",
    "crs_R45484": "The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is one of the most-tracked single accounts funded by Congress each year. Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it is the primary source of funding for the federal government's domestic general disaster relief programs. These programs, authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), outline the federal role in supporting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as they respond to and recover from a variety of incidents. They take effect in the event that nonfederal levels of government find their own capacity to deal with an incident is overwhelmed. The current emergency management policy environment assumes this federal role in domestic disaster relief as the default position and the availability of resources through the DRF a necessary requirement. However, this was not always the case. The concept of general disaster relief from the federal government predates both FEMA and the Stafford Act, but federal involvement in relief after natural and man-made disasters was very rare before the Civil War, and was at times considered unconstitutional. Domestic disaster relief efforts became more common after the Civil War, but were not seen as a necessary obligation of the federal government. Standing federal domestic disaster relief programs and a pool of resources to fund them only emerged after the Second World War. Prior to the development of these programs, domestic disaster relief and recovery was a matter for private nongovernmental organizations and state and local governments. Once established, the federal role in domestic disaster response and recovery grew, proving politically popular and resilient despite periodic concerns about management, execution, and budgetary impacts. As the DRF is the primary source of funding for most general disaster relief programs, it is an indicator of the scope of those programs and the volume of taxpayer-funded aid they provide. Understanding the trends in the growth of the federal government's role in general disaster relief and recovery, and the associated costs of that role, may be useful as Congress considers changes in both emergency management and budgetary policies. This report introduces the DRF and outlines how its resources are made available through a series of simple questions, presents a brief history of the federal government's involvement in domestic disaster relief, describes how the request for general disaster relief funding has been formulated over time, and examines the congressional response to those requests. It also provides the funding history for the DRF, and discusses several issues before Congress connected to the fund and the general disaster relief programs it supports.",
    "crs_R45122": "The U.S. and Afghan governments, along with partner countries, remain engaged in combat with a robust Taliban-led insurgency. The conflict also involves an array of other armed groups, including active affiliates of both Al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or by the Arabic acronym Da'esh). Since early 2015, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, known as \"Resolute Support Mission\" (RSM), has focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan government forces; combat operations by U.S. counterterrorism forces, along with some partner forces, also continue. These two \"complementary missions\" make up Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS). Simultaneously, the United States is engaged in an aggressive diplomatic effort to end the war, most notably through direct talks with Taliban representatives (a dramatic reversal of U.S. policy). A draft framework, in which the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups from operating on Afghan soil in return for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces, was reached between U.S. and Taliban negotiators in January 2019, though lead U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad insists that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\" Negotiations do not, as of May 2019, directly involve representatives of the Afghan government, leading some to worry that the United States will prioritize a military withdrawal over a complex political settlement that preserves some of the social, political, and humanitarian gains made since 2001. Underlying the negotiations is the unsettled state of Afghan politics, which is a major complicating factor: Afghanistan held inconclusive parliamentary elections in October 2018 and the all-important presidential election, originally scheduled for April 2019, has now been postponed twice until September 2019. The Afghan government has made some progress in reducing corruption and implementing its budgetary commitments, but faces domestic criticism for its failure to guarantee security and prevent insurgent gains. The United States has contributed approximately $133 billion in various forms of aid to Afghanistan over the past decade and a half, from building up and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to economic development. This assistance has increased Afghan government capacity, but prospects for stability in Afghanistan appear distant. Some U.S. policymakers still hope that the country's largely underdeveloped natural resources and/or geographic position at the crossroads of future global trade routes might improve the economic life of the country, and, by extension, its social and political dynamics as well. Nevertheless, Afghanistan's economic and political outlook remains uncertain, if not negative, in light of ongoing hostilities.",
    "gao_GAO-18-547": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2012, Education began offering a voluntary process to certify borrowers' employment and loans as eligible for PSLF. Borrowers can request to have their employment and loans certified at any time to make sure they are meeting basic program requirements and are on track towards qualifying for loan forgiveness. GAO was asked to review the PSLF program. This report examines (1) the extent to which borrowers have taken an initial step towards qualifying for PSLF by having their employment and loans certified, and (2) the extent to which Education provides borrowers with sufficient information to determine which employers qualify for PSLF. GAO reviewed Education data on borrowers' qualifying payments and interviewed Education officials and PSLF servicer officials. What GAO Found Over 890,000 borrowers have taken an initial step towards qualifying for the Public Service Loan forgiveness (PSLF) program by voluntarily having their employment and loans certified as eligible for PSLF, according to data from the PSLF servicer as of April 2018. Of these, over 520,000 borrowers had recorded at least one qualifying payment that counted towards the 120 required to be eligible for loan forgiveness. In total, almost 1.2 million borrowers requested to have their employment and loans certified but over 280,000 were denied, primarily due to missing information on the form, or because they did not have qualifying federal loans or work for a qualifying employer, according to data from the PSLF servicer. In total, almost 1.2 million borrowers requested to have their employment and loans certified but over 280,000 were denied, primarily due to missing information on the form, or because they did not have qualifying federal loans or work for a qualifying employer, according to data from the PSLF servicer. In total, almost 1.2 million borrowers requested to have their employment and loans certified but over 280,000 were denied, primarily due to missing information on the form, or because they did not have qualifying federal loans or work for a qualifying employer, according to data from the PSLF servicer. In total, almost 1.2 million borrowers requested to have their employment and loans certified but over 280,000 were denied, primarily due to missing information on the form, or because they did not have qualifying federal loans or work for a qualifying employer, according to data from the PSLF servicer. Borrower confusion about PSLF requirements persists, and recent legislation requires Education to conduct additional outreach to borrowers about PSLF. Education does not have a comprehensive document or manual to provide the PSLF servicer guidance and instructions, which PSLF servicer officials said makes it difficult to effectively administer the program and provide consistent service to borrowers. Instead, Education's guidance and instructions to the PSLF servicer are dispersed in a piecemeal manner across multiple documents, including Education's original contract with the servicer, multiple updates to the contract, and hundreds of emails. According to PSLF servicer officials, administering the program based on this fragmented collection of guidance and instructions creates a risk that relevant information may be overlooked. Education has recently taken some steps to provide clearer guidance and instructions, such as holding meetings with PSLF servicer officials every 2 weeks to discuss any administrative issues. Education officials also told GAO they plan to develop a comprehensive PSLF servicing manual, but they do not have a timeline for doing so. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should communicate information to those who need it in order to achieve the agencies' objectives. Unless Education provides additional information to help the PSLF servicer make employer assessments, it will remain difficult to determine whether employers qualify for the program, raising the risk that borrowers' certification requests will be improperly approved or denied. Moreover, without access to sufficient information about qualifying employers, borrowers will not be able to reliably determine whether certain employers qualify for PSLF. Education does not ensure the PSLF servicer receives consistent information on borrowers' prior loan payments from other loan servicers, which could raise the risk of qualifying payments being miscounted. Borrowers should be confident that their loan payments will be accurately counted regardless of who their servicer is. However, Education has not ensured the PSLF servicer is receiving consistent loan payment history information from other loan servicers, increasing the risk of inaccurate qualifying payment counts. Borrowers should be confident that their loan payments will be accurately counted regardless of who their servicer is. However, Education has not ensured the PSLF servicer is receiving consistent loan payment history information from other loan servicers, increasing the risk of inaccurate qualifying payment counts. The chance that these and any other payment counting errors will go undetected is compounded by the fact that Education does not require the PSLF servicer to provide borrowers with details on which payments qualified and which did not. This makes it difficult for borrowers to detect erroneous",
    "gao_GAO-19-193": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS began assigning tax debt cases to private collection agencies in April 2017. IRS has not finalized its objectives, measures, and targets for the PDC program. GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of the PDC program. This report assesses the extent to which IRS (1) documented PDC program objectives and measures; (2) documented data on PDC revenue collection and cost results; and (3) addressed PDC program risks to prevent or address scams or other harmful effects on taxpayers. GAO reviewed IRS documents and data on PDC revenue collections and costs, and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not clearly defined program objectives, measures, and targets for the Private Debt Collection (PDC) program. IRS officials said they wanted some experience with the program before establishing its objectives and measures, so in June 2018 and August 2018, officials held working sessions to draft the program's mission, vision, and values statements, and link performance metrics to them. The resulting proposed mission statement was to \u201cprovide taxpayers an opportunity to understand and resolve their tax obligations and apply tax laws in a manner that is consistent with IRS collection practices.\u201d However, the objectives do not clearly link to two of the three PDC objectives\u2014applying tax laws consistently with IRS collection practices and providing taxpayers an opportunity to understand and resolve their tax obligations. IRS's reporting on the PDC program to Congress did not provide complete, quality financial information on some of the program's results for revenue collected and costs. Specifically, IRS's reporting did not clarify how much of the collected revenue went to the general fund of the Treasury (the Treasury) rather than to IRS for two special funds. IRS officials said they plan for future reports to include a program balance table and retained fund balance tables, but they do not plan to include a table on the amount of collected revenue that went to the Treasury because IRS is not required to include this in the report. IRS does not have plans to analyze data to identify ways to improve the results of the PDC program by using this information to guide the types of cases sent to collection agencies. GAO found that IRS has not conducted any analysis of PDC results to determine which types of cases are not potentially collectible and should not be assigned to collection agencies because they result in little or no collected revenue. IRS has established a risk management process to address PDC risks to taxpayers, but the process is not complete. IRS has taken some steps to identify risks, but has not fully implemented all elements of its risk management process for the PDC program. For example, IRS created a risk register to track the status of PDC risks. However, IRS has not consistently documented its assessment of taxpayer risks from the PDC program, making it unclear how risks will be prioritized. IRS has developed many responses to broadly address taxpayer risks in the PDC program, but has not clearly documented and aligned the responses to address specific risks. IRS officials said they welcome feedback about taxpayer risks, but documents they provided showed limited efforts to solicit feedback from external stakeholders about the PDC program. IRS officials said they welcome feedback about taxpayer risks, but documents they provided showed limited efforts to solicit feedback from external stakeholders about the PDC program.

IRS officials said they welcome feedback about taxpayer risks, but documents they provided showed limited efforts to solicit feedback from external stakeholders about the PDC program. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS (1) finalize the PDC program objectives and measures, (2) analyze PDC program results to identify the types of inactive cases that could be assigned to collection agencies, (3) clearly document and distinguish the complete list of identified risks to taxpayers in the PDC program risk register, and (4) more fully solicit and document feedback from external stakeholders to learn about taxpayer risks. IRS partially agreed with one and disagreed with two. IRS agreed with the remaining nine recommendations and outlined actions to implement them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-304": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government owns and leases hundreds of thousands of buildings across the country that cost billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain. In recent years, the federal government has taken steps to improve the management of federal real property and address long-standing issues by undertaking several government-wide initiatives and issuing memorandums to the CFO Act agencies. The CFO Act requires agencies to reduce the amount of space they occupy and to dispose of excess space. GSA manages vacated space that it leases to agencies. GAO was asked to review the federal government's efforts to reduce space. This report examines (1) the approaches and any challenges the 24 CFO Act agencies identified to achieving their reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space; (2) the extent to which these agencies reduced space and met their fiscal year 2016 targets; and (3) how the General Services Administration (GSA) manages vacated space that it has leased to these agencies. GAO reviewed agency plans and data on space reductions and interviewed officials from GSA, OMB, and the 24 CFO Act agencies. GAO also selected five agencies based on a variety of factors, including the size of the agency's domestic office and warehouse portfolio, the extent to which the agency met its fiscal year 2016 targets, and the types of real property authorities the agency has. What GAO Found The 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies identified strategies to more efficiently use space and common challenges. The 24 CFO Act agencies cited consolidation, co-location, or disposal as the primary means to reduce their office and warehouse space. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is in the process of consolidating staff from four offices in the National Capital Region into its 1.12-million square foot headquarters building in Washington, D.C. HUD leases its space through GSA and estimates that it will be able to return about 175,000 square feet of unneeded space back to GSA once all four offices are closed. At that point, GSA would then bear the cost of the space and work to lease it to another agency or otherwise dispose of it. Once the project is completed, HUD estimated that its headquarters building will accommodate about 500 more personnel (for a total of 3,200) and reduce its annual lease payments by about $11 million. The 24 CFO Act agencies also identified the major challenges they anticipated facing in their efforts to reduce space. The agencies most frequently cited the following challenges: Space reduction costs: Twenty of the 24 agencies reported that the costs of space reduction projects pose a challenge. Agency missions may require office locations in certain areas or require additional space to accommodate activities such as customer interactions. These requirements may preclude disposals or limit opportunities to reduce space. Workload growth: Eight of the 24 agencies reported that increases in their workload limited their ability to achieve overall agency space reductions. The majority of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported reductions in their office and warehouse space in fiscal year 2016 but achieved varied success in meeting their targets. For example, of the 17 agencies that reduced space, 9 exceeded their targets (i.e., reduced more space than planned); 7 reduced space but missed their target (by anywhere between 2.8 and 96.7 percent); and 1 agency expected to increase in square footage, but reduced space. In November 2016, GSA put into effect a new standard operating procedure to, among other things, standardize and streamline the process of receiving, reviewing, and documenting agencies' space release actions. GSA officials noted that this new process was implemented to rectify past concerns that space release requests were not centrally tracked, GSA regions may not have been making consistent determinations, and some requests either were missed or were not processed within the appropriate time frames. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-651T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government collects DNA from individuals arrested for certain crimes, and the federal government, over half of the states, and the District of Columbia have laws requiring the collection of DNA from individuals arrested for certain crimes. The CEBR grant program is a formula grant program that provides grants to states and localities to enhance capacity and reduce backlogs of requests for crime scene DNA analysis. GAO was asked to review the CEBR program. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which the backlog of requests for crime scene DNA analysis has increased and the factors that have contributed to this increase, and (2) the extent to which the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has controls to implement federal requirements associated with conflicts of interest related to CEBR grants, and controls related to lobbying. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing review of CEBR grant program data and related DOJ documents. GAO reviewed CEBR grant program data from 2011 through 2016 and interviewed NIJ officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found GAO's preliminary analysis of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction (CEBR) grant program data show that the backlog of requests for crime scene DNA analysis has increased by 77 percent from 2011 through 2016. The reported growth in the aggregate backlog is the result of labs receiving more requests than they were able to complete over time, and that demand for such DNA analysis has outpaced laboratory capacity. In GAO's review, GAO identified numerous factors that have contributed to an increased demand for DNA analysis beyond laboratories' capacities, including scientific advancements in DNA analysis technology and state laws requiring testing of certain DNA evidence. For example, recent scientific advancements have increased the quality of DNA analysis by allowing lab analysts to obtain DNA profiles from smaller amounts of biological evidence. This has increased the amount of evidence that is eligible to be analyzed and, as a result, has increased the demand for DNA testing. In addition, resource challenges and constraints on lab capacity are reported to have contributed to crime scene evidence backlogs. For example, state and local labs generally receive appropriations from state or local governments and are subject to local funding priorities. Federal grants can help, but even combined federal and jurisdictional funding may not increase lab capacity enough to keep up with increases in demand. Additionally, these labs report facing lengthy hiring and training processes for forensic analysts, and often lose staff to private or federal labs which may offer higher pay, further limiting lab capacity for completing analysis. GAO's preliminary results show that DOJ's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has not defined CEBR program-wide goals in clear, specific, and measurable terms. GAO identified statements in NIJ and CEBR program documentation that communicated program-wide goals, but the documentation did not consistently identify the same goals or cite the same number of goals. For example, a stated goal of improving the quality of DNA testing was included in only 2 of 4 NIJ documents GAO reviewed. In addition, NIJ officials verbally clarified that the CEBR program has two goals, (1) to increase laboratory capacity for DNA analysis and (2) to reduce backlogs of DNA evidence awaiting analysis. These differences can be seen across goal statements outlined in various NIJ sources. GAO continues to evaluate CEBR program goals and is in the process of evaluating related CEBR performance measures as part of its ongoing work. GAO's preliminary results show that OJP has controls to implement federal requirements associated with conflicts of interest and some controls related to lobbying that apply to both OJP CEBR grant administrators as well as recipients of grant funding; however, OJP has not fully established all appropriate controls related to lobbying. Specifically, federal law sets forth several requirements related to lobbying \"certification\" and \"disclosure.\" Lobbying certification refers to agreeing not to use appropriated funds to lobby, and lobbying disclosure refers to disclosing lobbying activities with respect to the covered federal action paid for with nonappropriated funds. Federal regulation requires recipients of all federal awards over $100,000 to file certification documents and disclosure forms (if applicable) with the next tier above, and to forward those same forms from the tier below if they issue subawards for $100,000 or more. In the case of CEBR grants, tiers include OJP, grantees, subgrantees, contractors under grantees and subgrantees, and subcontractors. OJP has established controls to obtain lobbying certification documents and disclosure forms from grantees, but has not fully established controls to ensure grantees obtain these documents from tiers below them.

    "gao_GAO-18-87": "Why GAO Did This Study State provides allowances to employees serving overseas to compensate them for the costs and hardships related to foreign assignments. GAO was asked to review State's allowances. This report (1) describes the allowances State offers its employees serving overseas and (2) examines the amount State spent annually on these allowances from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. GAO reviewed State's allowance policies and procedures, analyzed data from fiscal years 2011 through 2016, and interviewed State officials. What GAO Found The Department of State (State) offers 14 allowances to employees serving overseas to compensate them for the costs and hardships related to foreign assignments. These allowances include cost-of-living allowances, recruitment and retention incentive allowances, quarters allowances, and other allowances. The allowances include the following: (1) post allowances reimburse employees for certain excess costs, exclusive of any quarters costs, incurred from employment overseas. (2) home service transfer allowances defray an employee's extraordinary, necessary, and reasonable costs when he transfers to a post in a foreign area. (3) home service transfer allowances defray the additional expense of maintaining family members at another location because of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at the overseas post of assignment, (2) for the convenience of the U.S. government, or (3) because of special needs or hardships involving the employee or a family member. (4) educational travel allowances defray the expenses of one round trip for each dependent between a school attended and the overseas post of assignment. (5) recruitment and retention incentive allowances compensate employees for service at posts where conditions may be difficult or dangerous. (6) hardship pay compensates employees for service in foreign areas where conditions of environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States in that the living conditions are extraordinarily difficult, involve excessive physical hardship, or are notably unhealthy. (7) danger pay compensates employees for service in foreign areas where conditions of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. (8) hardship pay compensates employees for service in foreign areas where conditions of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. (9) the post allowance accounted for 15 percent ($417.3 million). (10) each of these 11 allowances accounted for less than 10 percent of total spending, ranging from danger pay ($266.5 million) to the educational travel allowance ($11.4 million). (11) State spent almost $480 million annually on the 14 allowances from fiscal years 2011 through 2016, with varying amounts for individual allowances. The lowest annual spending on such allowances during this period was $462.3 million in fiscal year 2011 and the highest was $496.1 million, in fiscal year 2014.",
    "gao_GAO-18-92": "Why GAO Did This Study The MMI Fund is the only federal credit program with a capital requirement. The MMI Fund is statutorily required to maintain at least a 2 percent capital ratio. The National Housing Act requires GAO to report annually on the MMI Fund. This report examines (1) the types of information actuarial reviews and other assessments provide about the MMI Fund's financial condition, including its ability to remain self-sufficient; (2) the extent to which the capital requirement and stress testing practices for the MMI Fund are consistent with principles and practices underlying those of other financial institutions; and (3) key advantages and disadvantages of including both forward and HECM in the MMI Fund's capital assessment. GAO reviewed actuarial reports and FHA budget and financial documents, and interviewed FHA officials and industry participants. What GAO Found The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) budgetary and actuarial reviews provide complementary information about the MMI Fund's financial condition, including its ability to remain self-sufficient. The MMI Fund's annual budgetary review\u2014specifically, the credit subsidy estimates and reestimates discussed previously\u2014determines the fund's financing account and capital reserve account balances. The capital reserve account holds additional funds that could be used to cover unexpected losses (for example, due to higher-than-expected mortgage defaults). If the capital reserve account had insufficient funds to cover an upward credit subsidy reestimate (that is, an increase in expected lifetime costs), FHA would draw on permanent and indefinite budget authority. The actuarial reviews also have projected the MMI Fund's performance under alternative economic scenarios, including stress tests. The MMI Fund's capital requirement and stress tests are consistent with some principles and practices promulgated or used by financial institutions and regulators, but are not consistent with others. For example, the capital requirement is not based on a specified risk threshold and lacks accountability mechanisms. GAO was unable to determine whether the capital requirement is consistent with the element on balancing financial soundness with the entity's role and mission because such an assessment would require more information about the severity of the economic conditions the capital requirement was designed to withstand without supplemental funding. The MMI Fund's capital requirement is consistent with GAO's framework element on transparency and partially consistent with two other elements\u2014that the requirement include both risk-based and fixed components and that the requirement be designed to cover unexpected losses and be based on specified risk thresholds. However, the MMI Fund's capital requirement is not consistent with the element on including accountability mechanisms. GAO was unable to determine whether the requirement is consistent with the element on balancing financial soundness with the entity's role and mission because such an assessment would require more information about the severity of the economic conditions the capital requirement was designed to withstand without supplemental funding. FHA has not conducted fund-wide stress tests or defined the specific objectives of its tests. Stress tests of the MMI Fund are consistent with two of the five elements in GAO's stress testing framework\u2014that stress testing methods and results be transparent and stress testing scenarios capture relevant risks. The stress testing practices are inconsistent with two other elements\u2014that the scope of testing includes entity-wide assessments and that the specific objectives of the tests be defined. GAO was unable to determine the consistency of MMI Fund stress testing practices with the framework element that methods and scenarios be consistent with the objectives of the tests because FHA has not defined specific objectives. The MMI Fund's capital assessment has advantages and disadvantages. First, including HECMs in the MMI Fund's capital assessment could address some of the disadvantages of this approach but would also involve potential trade-offs between mission, financial soundness, and transparency goals. Second, a separate HECM capital requirement would help ensure that the financial condition of future loan cohorts in the forward mortgage portfolio is not masked by a combined capital ratio. However, if the HECM portfolio were required to independently meet a minimum capital ratio, the volatility of the portfolio's economic value could make it difficult for FHA to consistently meet the requirement without targeting a capital level substantially above the minimum requirement. Doing so may require FHA to raise insurance premiums or place greater restrictions on the amount seniors can borrow, which would limit the program's ability to serve its goal of alleviating economic hardship. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FHA (1) combine stress test results for the forward mortgage and HECM portfolios, where possible, and report estimated MMI Fund-wide capital ratios for the stress scenarios examined; and (2) develop specific objectives for stress tests of the MMI Fund and apply stress testing methods and scenarios consistent",
    "gao_GAO-18-76": "Why GAO Did This Study SBA uses NAICS codes to assign a standard to each industry to determine eligibility for federal small business assistance. SBA also uses size standards to determine eligibility for federal small business assistance. GAO was asked to review the assignment of NAICS codes to federal contracts. This report examines (1) what contracting officers consider when assigning NAICS codes to federal contracts and the status of efforts to clarify code assignment and (2) stakeholder views on NAICS code assignment and the number and outcomes of appeals filed with the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). GAO reviewed federal laws and regulations related to NAICS code assignment and relevant policies and procedures from the four agencies with the highest indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract obligations from fiscal years 2011\u20132015 (the 5 most recent years of Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation data available when GAO began its review). GAO also interviewed officials from three industry groups and five small businesses that filed NAICS code appeals during calendar years 2014\u20132016 (the 3 most recent years of data available). GAO also reviewed SBA's process for reviewing NAICS code appeals. What GAO Found Contracting officers at the Army, Navy, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that contracting officers refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) when assigning NAICS codes and consider a variety of factors. Contracting officers at these four agencies cited several factors, including a contract's scope of work, that are involved in determining the NAICS code for a contract solicitation or an order: Statements of work and market research reports. Contracting officers at these four agencies stated that they review the statements of work and assign the code that represents the majority of the work. Contracting officers at all four agencies stated that they assign a single NAICS code for each solicitation, including for multiple-award contracts, because their contract writing systems and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) do not allow them to enter more than one code per contract. Contracting officers at all four agencies stated that they assign a single NAICS code for each solicitation, including for multiple-award contracts, because their contract writing systems and FPDS-NG do not allow them to enter more than one code per contract. In 2013, SBA issued a rule on assigning NAICS codes to multiple-award contracts that may further clarify code assignment for contracting officers. The purpose of the rule was to implement the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which amended the Small Business Act to allow small business set-asides for parts of multiple-award contracts, for orders placed against multiple-award contracts, and for reserving one or more contract awards for small business concerns. The final rule clarifies that if a multiple-award contract consists of discrete categories, contracting officers may assign a different NAICS code and corresponding size standard to each category. Additionally, under the final rule, contracting officers may issue orders under each category as long as the category's NAICS code matches the order's NAICS code. Some of the stakeholders GAO interviewed\u2014three industry groups and five small businesses that had filed NAICS code appeals\u2014expressed concern that contracting officers assign NAICS codes because they want specific size standards, not because they are the most appropriate codes, but several also stated it was difficult to determine how often this occurs. Specifically, the three industry groups and four of the five appellants GAO interviewed contended that contracting officers in some instances assign NAICS codes that allow them to make an award to a firm that would not be considered a small business under the \u201cappropriate\u201d code. Conversely, an official of one firm told GAO that contracting officers in some instances assign NAICS codes with smaller size standards to limit competition for a contract. Because agencies have a federal mandate to meet small business contracting goals, contracting officers are required to provide maximum practicable opportunity to award contracts to small businesses in support of those goals. SBA officials acknowledged that assigning codes based on size standards may occur, but noted that it is OHA's role to review the appropriateness of appealed NAICS code assignments, not the contracting officer's intention behind assigning the code. SBA's process for NAICS code appeals includes (1) determining if appeals are timely and within OHA's jurisdiction, (2) determining if the appellant is adversely affected by the assignment, and (3) expediting NAICS code appeals that are accepted. Of the 62 NAICS code appeals filed during calendar years 2014\u20132016, the majority were dismissed or denied. During this same time period, approximately 1.4 million new federal contracts were awarded, and 2",

This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has established cross-functional teams that are responsive to section 911, and (2) the extent to which DOD has implemented training or issued guidance for its cross-functional teams or provided training to presidential appointees. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, DOD documents, and a draft of this report, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has established 10 cross-functional teams that OCMO officials consider responsive to section 911, and these teams are in various stages of implementation. The Secretary of Defense established a cross-functional team to manage the transfer of background investigations for DOD personnel security clearances from the Office of Personnel Management to DOD.

The PRA requires that agencies develop an objectively supported burden hour estimate, but neither the act, nor Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations prescribe how agencies should develop these estimates. Among the four agencies, IRS was the only one to report gathering original data on public burden through surveys of individual taxpayers and businesses to help inform the estimates for its two largest ICRs. The PRA requires that agencies develop an objectively supported burden hour estimate, but neither the act, nor OMB regulations prescribe how agencies should develop these estimates. Among the 200 ICRs reviewed (including the 8 largest ICRs), 76 ICRs did not include respondent time cost estimates. Specifically, of the 50 ICRs with the largest burden hours at each agency, GAO found agencies did not include total annual respondent time costs for IRS\u2014all 50, including its 2 largest ICRs; DOT\u201419, including its 2 largest ICRs; HHS\u20145, including its second-largest ICR; and USDA\u20142 ICRs. OMB requires agencies to include estimated respondent time costs in the ICR supporting statements. However, OMB reviewed and approved all 76 ICRs GAO identified that did not include these estimates. Unless OMB takes action to ensure that agencies consistently follow its guidelines to include respondent time costs, agencies will likely continue to not meet the requirement and omit this information. Without clear guidance about how to consistently estimate respondent time costs, Congress and the administration cannot effectively compare information collection cost savings for the public. Agencies' independent review processes did not detect errors in burden and cost estimates or other discrepancies. GAO found multiple calculation errors in the supporting statements at three of the four selected agencies\u2014USDA, HHS, and DOT\u2014that over-or underestimated burden hours and costs to varying degrees, sometimes by millions of hours or hundreds of millions of dollars. GAO also found inconsistencies among estimates in the Federal Register (Federal Register) and supporting statements. For example, GAO found that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not follow its stated assumptions in calculating burden hours and costs for its second largest ICR based on estimated burden hours. Similarly, the Department of Transportation (DOT) did not consistently apply its stated assumptions in the development of burden hour estimates, resulting in underestimated costs presented to the public. Until agencies ensure that their review processes adequately detect errors and inconsistencies, the agencies cannot ensure that their burden estimates are reliable, may result in less confidence in agencies' ability to accurately compute and report burden and as such, less confidence in agencies' ability to effectively manage and minimize the burden they impose on the public. Agencies GAO reviewed conducted varying levels of public consultation and received little input on burden estimates. For example, 35 of the 161 ICRs that GAO reviewed solicited comments through 60-day Federal Register notices. However, only 10 received comments related to the burden estimates, according to the ICR supporting statement and related documents. Despite the value of public input, agencies' Federal Register notices did not always contain a complete description of the elements that make up the burden estimates. As a result, the public may not have had enough information to comment on the reasonableness of the estimates. The agencies GAO reviewed did not always consult with the public on information collections beyond the publication of Federal Register notices, as required by the PRA and regulations. When they did consult with the public, agencies did not always use these consultations as an opportunity to explicitly ask about burden hour estimates. For example, IRS did not always include data on the frequency of the collection because it might cause confusion for those instances where only a",
    "gao_GAO-18-50": "Why GAO Did This Study Border Patrol has a mission to enforce immigration laws and enforce immigration enforcement. In fiscal years 2011 through 2016, Border Patrol had about 19,500 agents on board, and Border Patrol has faced challenges in staffing to that level. GAO was asked to review the impact of checkpoints on communities. This report examines (1) how Border Patrol deploys agents and how agents are scheduled for operations and patrol activities, (2) the extent to which checkpoints contribute to apprehensions and seizures, and (3) the extent to which Border Patrol collects data on community impacts. GAO analyzed Border Patrol data on agent deployment, apprehensions, and seizures from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and interviewed Border Patrol officials and community members in the two sectors GAO visited. What GAO Found Border Patrol deploys agents based on factors such as availability and geography, among other factors. Border Patrol officials said that decisions about agent deployment in terms of location and activity are based on multiple factors, including the availability of agents for a given shift, the geography in a station's area of responsibility, and illegal traffic patterns. For example, when considering the various assignments that need to be filled for a given day, supervisors must take into account agents that are unavailable because they are off duty, on scheduled leave, or are scheduled to attend training. The geography in a station's area of responsibility can also affect decisions about where to deploy available agents. Border Patrol officials said that the reasons for variations in border zone deployment are the same as GAO previously reported in December 2012. From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, 33 percent of southwest border apprehensions were made one-half mile or less from the border, and over this time period apprehensions increasingly occurred closer to the border. During the same time period, the percentage of apprehensions occurring more than 20 miles from the border steadily dropped, from 27 percent in fiscal year 2012 to 15 percent of all apprehensions in fiscal year 2016. Border Patrol officials said other factors may also have contributed to the change in apprehension patterns, such as changes in where patrols occurred during the time period GAO analyzed. determining the extent to which apprehensions and seizures farther from the border are attributable to checkpoints is difficult because of data quality issues that have persisted since GAO previously reported on checkpoints in August 2009. GAO found that Border Patrol had established a number of measures for checkpoint performance to inform the public on program results and provide management oversight, including measures related to apprehensions and seizures at checkpoints and on circumvention routes. However, GAO reported that information gaps and reporting issues hindered public accountability and that inconsistent data collection and entry hindered Border Patrol's ability to monitor the need for program improvement. GAO recommended, among other things, that Border Patrol establish internal controls for management oversight of the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of checkpoint performance data. Border Patrol has since issued guidance in response to GAO's recommendations, but has not provided sufficient oversight of the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of checkpoint performance data since the guidance was issued. Until revised internal control practices are in place, including data collection guidance and sufficient oversight of the recording of the data, GAO continues to believe that its recommendations remain warranted. Collecting additional data could improve Border Patrol's existing efforts to identify and respond to community concerns regarding the defense in depth strategy. For example, members of state and local law enforcement and business and community groups GAO spoke with generally support Border Patrol's efforts, but some raised concerns about checkpoint operations and the broader defense in depth strategy. Collecting additional data could inform actions to address such effects. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report. In its comments on this report, the Department of Homeland Security concurred with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-618": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S. agencies have provided assistance to police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which have a history of human rights violations by security forces. GAO was asked to review U.S. police training efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This report examines (1) the extent to which U.S. agencies have established objectives for and delivered training to professionalize police, including promoting respect for human rights; (2) the extent to which agencies have collected data related to police training indicators; and (3) the actions U.S. agencies have planned and undertaken to support the ability of partner nations to sustain police training. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C., and El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. What GAO Found U.S. agencies have established objectives and delivered training to professionalize police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, but have not consistently done so related to respect for human rights. For example, U.S. national security strategies for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras include an objective to \u201cprofessionalize civilian police.\u201d However, the Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State) have established few objectives to provide human rights training to police in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. For example, State has not established specific objectives to provide police training on respect for human rights, but internal control mechanisms, such as written policies, have helped ensure that training delivered to police consistently incorporates content on respect for human rights. Creating internal control mechanisms, such as objectives or directives to training implementing partners, would help ensure that State- and USAID-funded police training is consistent with U.S. government and agency priorities in including content related to respect for human rights as appropriate. Without such objectives or internal control mechanisms, it may be difficult for these agencies to account for the extent to which implementing partners include human rights content or to assess progress being made with respect to partner nation police forces' respect for human rights\u2014a key goal of U.S. strategy in Central America. DOD and USAID have collected some information on the number of police trained, but State lacks readily available, reliable data on this indicator. Neither agency collects data in relation to a specific indicator on police training. Nonetheless, both agencies gather some information regarding civilian police they have trained. For example, DOD officials identified civilian police participants from El Salvador and Guatemala who participated in DOD's Defense Institute of International Legal Studies training events during fiscal year 2013. Further, State is responsible for tracking progress toward a key indicator related to police training in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. However, State lacks readily available, reliable data on the total number of police trained through its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). INL officials told GAO that they do not have readily available data on the number of police trained through INL-funded projects. Nevertheless, INL officials told GAO that they would use a similar process to compile data for reporting progress related to the U.S. Strategy for Central America indicator on the number and percentage of civilian police trained by INL. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State design internal control mechanisms to ensure human rights content is included in INL-funded police training for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as appropriate. State concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-272": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat and poultry products. FSIS has developed or revised pathogen standards for assessing the effectiveness of plants' controls in reducing the level of pathogens in certain meat and poultry products. GAO was asked to review the progress USDA has made in reducing pathogens in meat and poultry products. This report examines (1) the extent to which USDA has revised or revised pathogen standards for meat and poultry products and (2) the challenges USDA faces in reducing pathogens in meat and poultry products. GAO reviewed USDA's guidance and regulations, and interviewed USDA officials and representatives from consumer groups and industry. GAO also interviewed officials from FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found USDA's FSIS has revised or revised pathogen standards for some meat and poultry products but has not revised other standards since 1996, and the agency has not set time frames for determining whether revisions are needed. Specifically, FSIS revised the pathogen standards for comminuted (including ground and other mechanically separated) chicken and turkey carcasses in 2016 to help achieve public health goals for reducing human illness from Salmonella, among other things. However, FSIS has not revised the standards for beef carcasses and ground beef since they were first developed in 1996. FSIS officials said that the agency is developing options for how it might move forward and could determine that revised or new standards are not needed and that other policies could suffice in addressing pathogens in beef. In the meantime, however, the agency in 2014 suspended monitoring against the existing Salmonella standards for ground beef until the agency develops a revised standard. The agency also suspended monitoring whether plants were meeting the pathogen standard for Salmonella on pork carcasses because, according to agency officials, the percentage of pork carcass samples that tested positive for Salmonella was consistently low. FSIS officials said that the agency is collecting data on pathogens in pork that could lead to new standards for pork products. In the absence of testing against the standards, the agency has other tools to ensure plants are controlling pathogens. For example, the agency continues to test beef for levels of E. coli, and FSIS inspectors at plants are to routinely check records to verify a plant's compliance with its Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point plans. FSIS officials said that the agency has no time frames for determining what actions to take. Program schedule planning is recognized as a leading practice to ensure organizational activities are completed as planned, according to the Project Management Institute's Standard for Program Management. By setting time frames for determining what pathogen standards or additional policies are needed to address pathogen levels in beef carcasses, ground beef, and pork products, FSIS could better ensure it completes these activities in a timely manner to protect human health. In addition to taking steps to develop or revise pathogen standards, USDA's FSIS is addressing other challenges GAO identified in September 2014 with respect to poultry pathogens, but these challenges are ongoing and also apply to meat products. These challenges include FSIS's limited control over factors that affect the level of pathogens outside of plants, pathogens not designated as hazards, the complex nature of Salmonella, limited Campylobacter research and testing, limited enforcement authority, absence of mandatory recall authority, and insufficient prevalence estimates. For example, FSIS has not developed standards for beef carcasses, ground beef, and pork carcasses since they were first developed in 1996. FSIS officials said that the agency is developing options for how it might move forward and could determine that revised or new standards are not needed and that other policies could suffice in addressing pathogens in beef.

    "gao_GAO-18-45": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD relies on SRMs to propel various types of missiles and also use space launch systems. DOD relies on a multi-tiered supply chain to provide the SRMs that are used for missile propulsion. GAO was asked to review the SRM supply chain. This report examines (1) the trends in the SRM supply chain and the impact of these trends on the SRM supplier base, (2) the impact of single-source suppliers on the supply chain, and (3) the extent to which manufacturing engineers' SRM design skills have changed since the start of new missile programs. GAO reviewed DOD reports and interviewed DOD and SRM manufacturers, and DOD officials. What GAO Found The Solid Rocket Motors (SRM) supply chain has consolidated from six to two U.S. manufacturers--Aerojet Rocketdyne and Orbital ATK. Both manufacturers produce the small and large SRMs used in tactical and missile defense systems, and Orbital ATK also produces SRMs for strategic missiles. A senior MIBP official told GAO that current DOD needs require two SRM manufacturers, but there is not enough demand to keep three companies economically viable. In DOD's industrial base reports to Congress, MIBP has reported that, while other industrial sectors are supported by commercial markets in addition to government needs, SRM manufacturers cater largely to the defense and space missions of the government and generally do not have a commercial base that can sustain production when the federal government's demand fluctuates. As a result, trends or decisions made in a particular program area can have broader effects and potentially result in cost increases for other programs. For example, a company that is supporting space launch has decided to source its SRMs from Orbital ATK instead of Aerojet Rocketdyne, which had previously produced the motors. This arrangement will take effect in 2019, and Aerojet Rocketdyne officials said that it is consolidating its facilities to reduce costs due to excess production capacity for these types of large SRMs. DOD says that these costs would likely be passed on to the missile systems programs. Additionally, if Aerojet Rocketdyne decides to exit the large SRM market altogether, the lack of competition is likely to result in increased costs for other DOD programs that use large SRMs. Single-source suppliers drive material availability risks but mitigation actions under way. During GAO's review, GAO found that the decreased demand for SRMs has resulted in a loss of suppliers in the supply chain, increasing the risk that key components and materials are only available from single sources. Should such components and materials become unavailable, production delays could result. MIBP's reports to Congress and GAO's discussions with industry representatives showed increased awareness of supply chain risks and steps taken to identify and mitigate risks before they affect SRM production, including coordination of efforts to address key chemicals needed for SRM propulsion. Manufacturing engineers' SRM design skills have declined since the start of new missile programs, but a workforce project is underway. MIBP's annual industrial capabilities reports to Congress have consistently stated that the limited number of new missile development programs inhibits DOD's ability to provide opportunities that maintain the workforce capabilities SRM manufacturers need to meet current and future national security objectives. These capabilities include engineering skills related to SRM concept designs, system development, and production, which are critical to meeting potential requirements for new SRM designs. With few new-start missile programs being initiated and decades-old programs having reached a steady state of design, SRM engineers are not typically engaged at the early stages of development and newer engineers have not fielded new SRM designs, thus creating a skills gap. MIBP officials said they have raised concerns that the use of foreign SRM suppliers results in fewer opportunities for domestic SRM manufacturers such as exercising their design skills. MIBP has an effort underway intended to address these diminishing design skills. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD reviewed the draft and offered technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-453": "Why GAO Did This Study Puget Sound is a vital watershed in the western United States. The basin includes about 19 major watersheds, including about 2,800 square miles of inland marine waters and thousands of rivers and streams. The basin is also home to 19 federally recognized tribes, including 19 federally recognized tribes. The federal government has identified numerous environmental stresses that threaten Puget Sound and that have impaired water quality. The Partnership has reported that nonpoint sources of pollution, such as polluted stormwater runoff from roads and agricultural fields, are the biggest threats to Puget Sound water quality. GAO was asked to examine federal and state efforts to restore Puget Sound. This report examines (1) federal and state efforts and related expenditures for fiscal years 2012 through 2016; (2) how federal and nonfederal entities coordinate their restoration efforts and their views on this coordination; (3) the framework for assessing progress toward Puget Sound restoration; and (4) key factors, if any, federal and nonfederal entities identified that may limit the success of Puget Sound restoration. GAO surveyed 15 federal and 11 state entities, analyzed agency documents, and interviewed federal and nonfederal officials. What GAO Found Federal and state entities GAO surveyed identified numerous federal and state efforts that, in whole or in part, supported Puget Sound restoration from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Some of these efforts focused exclusively on restoration activities in the Puget Sound basin, while others had a broader national, regional, or statewide focus or had a broader scope of work that did not center directly on restoration activities. These efforts were supported by a variety of federal and nonfederal funding sources, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's National Estuary Program and Puget Sound Geographic Program, which together expended about $142 million for activities in Puget Sound during this time frame according to EPA data. However, total expenditures across all restoration efforts are unknown, in part because of data limitations such as difficulties isolating expenditures specific to the Puget Sound basin for some efforts. Federal and nonfederal entities have taken steps to coordinate their restoration efforts in Puget Sound and identify both benefits and challenges to interagency coordination. The Puget Sound Management Conference and the federal task force, which coordinate the efforts of federal agencies in support of the CCMP, are the primary interagency groups to coordinate restoration efforts. The federal task force, which focuses on higher-level policy, oversight, and coordination issues, has made progress by coordinating its actions through the Federal Action Plan and can continue to make progress as it takes steps to implement the draft plan\u2014and, if applicable, any final version of the plan that is approved. However, the federal task force has limited ability to assess how the implementation of its plan contributes to overall restoration progress because the task force has not clearly linked the plan's priority federal actions to the framework's goals, vital signs, indicators, or recovery targets. By working with the management conference on future updates to the CCMP to help prioritize among the indicators that currently lack measurable targets and ensure that such targets are developed for the highest priority indicators where possible, EPA would better position the federal task force to assess the impact of its efforts and the implementation of the draft\u2014and, if applicable, final\u2014action plan. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the federal task force work with the management conference on future updates to the CCMP to help prioritize among the indicators that currently lack measurable targets and ensure that such targets are developed for the highest priority indicators where possible. EPA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-669": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States provides humanitarian assistance in countries that are often plagued by conflict, instability, or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. Some of these countries also face U.S. sanctions that are aimed at their governments or other actors that engage in terrorism or illicit activities. Additionally, U.S. agencies are required to conduct proper due diligence on entities, such as those transferring funds to high-risk countries. GAO was asked to review the extent to which (1) implementing partners of State and USAID experience banking access challenges that affect their implementation of humanitarian assistance projects, (2) USAID implementing partners' reporting on banking access challenges, and (3) actions relevant U.S. agencies have taken to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO). GAO reviewed relevant studies and documents, interviewed relevant officials, and reviewed USAID and NPO reports. What GAO Found For 7 of 18 selected U.S.-funded projects, State and USAID partners told GAO that they had experienced banking access challenges in implementing their projects, with the majority citing delays or denials of funds transfers. Specifically, 3 (of 5) partners in Somalia and 4 (of 7) partners in Syria told GAO that they had experienced banking access challenges related to the selected project. None of the partners implementing selected sample projects in Haiti or Kenya noted that they had experienced any banking access challenges. The most frequently cited challenges were funds transfer delays and denials. Some partners that experienced banking access challenges told GAO that those challenges had adversely affected or posed a potential risk to project implementation. For example, 1 partner that experienced challenges on one of GAO's selected projects and 2 partners that experienced challenges on projects outside of GAO's sample noted that the challenges had adversely affected a project's implementation. Nevertheless, a few partners noted that projects they were implementing were adversely affected by such challenges. For example, 1 of GAO's selected projects faced repeated delays as a result of banking access challenges. Additionally, 2 partners noted that they had to reduce the scope of implementation or suspend projects in their global humanitarian assistance portfolio because of banking access challenges. Furthermore, several partners and other NPOs told GAO that such challenges posed potential risks to project implementation. Lastly, a recent study found that more than two-thirds of all U.S.-based NPOs that work internationally experienced banking access challenges, but that few NPOs canceled programs as a result of those challenges. USAID's partners' written reports do not capture potential risks posed by banking access challenges because USAID generally does not require most partners to report in writing any challenges that do not affect implementation. Six of the 7 projects that noted experiencing banking access challenges were USAID projects. None of those 6 USAID partners reported on the banking access challenges they had experienced to USAID in their regular project reporting. USAID requires partners to report adverse effects to their projects, but 1 partner that faced delays on its project as a result of banking access challenges did not identify these challenges as the reason for delays in its reporting to USAID. GAO also reviewed over 1,300 USAID partner reports for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 from high-risk countries and found no explicit discussion of banking access challenges. Both the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Department of State (State) have taken actions to help address banking access challenges encountered by NPOs; however, USAID's efforts to address these challenges have been limited by a lack of communication about them\u2014both within the agency and with external entities. Treasury, as a lead agency in fighting financial crimes and as an issuer of regulations that have a significant effect on charities' access to the banking system, has conducted meetings between charities, banks, and government officials to discuss banking access challenges and released guidance on sanctions and other related issues. State, as a provider of funding for humanitarian assistance, has issued guidance to its overseas posts on banking access challenges. In addition, both State and Treasury are involved in international efforts led by the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force to help address banking access challenges. Although USAID's partners have experienced banking access challenges, USAID has had more limited engagement than State and Treasury with other agencies, international organizations, and NPOs on addressing such challenges\u2014in part because of a lack of communication about them, both within the agency and with external entities. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Administrator of USAID take steps to collect information on banking access challenges experienced by its implementing partners. USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-659": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS's Appeals is the primary mechanism for taxpayers to appeal IRS decisions about tax collection actions and proposed tax assessments. GAO was asked to review the Appeals process. This report examines (1) the extent to which Appeals has a standard process to resolve taxpayer appeals and (2) the extent to which Appeals makes customer service standards and related performance results transparent to taxpayers. GAO analyzed IRS data on appeals closed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, reviewed IRS policies and procedures, and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Office of Appeals (Appeals) has a standard process to resolve taxpayer appeals of IRS enforcement actions and decisions. Appeals has a workforce of about 1,345 staff with expertise in all areas of tax law. However, Appeals experienced nearly a 9 percent annual attrition rate from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2017 and projects a similar attrition rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Appeals anticipates a continued risk of losing subject matter expertise given that a large share of its workforce is eligible for retirement. Appeals has developed a series of process measures to monitor the amount of time for a case to move through an Appeals workstream. These measures track the number of days from Appeals receipt through the appeal review process to when a case is closed in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Automated Collection Data System (ACDS)\u2014the system used to control and track cases in Appeals inventory. Appeals also measures the amount of time for compliance units to transfer appeals cases. For example, for collection due process appeals closed in fiscal year 2017, approximately 4 percent (1,559) of these collection appeals took more than 120 days to be transferred to Appeals. Delays in transferring requests to Appeals affect prompt resolution for the taxpayer and IRS. Additional monitoring of collection transfer time requirements together with establishing transfer time guidelines and procedures for examination appeal review could improve appeal review timeliness and overall taxpayer experience. Appeals maintains data on the time taken to transfer appeals and monitors the progress and time to resolve appeals within its diverse workstreams. Sharing these performance data within IRS could shed light on actual transfer times and aid compliance units in improving and establishing related controls to ensure more timely transfer. Increasing the transparency of total case resolution time with more detailed information by Appeals workstream would improve taxpayers' understanding about what to expect when choosing to request an appeal. Improving the taxpayer experience with the appeals process also depends on clarity on customer service standards and related performance results. Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRAMA) and Executive Orders for customer service, Treasury is responsible for customer service performance. Publicly stating what service taxpayers should expect and from whom sets the stage for a customer-focused appeals process where taxpayers can feel their story is heard. This also helps fulfill Treasury's customer service responsibility. Appeals has demonstrated its willingness to analyze customer satisfaction feedback. IRS and Appeals share goals to work with stakeholders, and Appeals has acted to address practitioner reactions to operational changes underway. Developing a mechanism to solicit and consider public input on future policy and procedure proposals would better position Appeals to bolster customer service and effectively implement changes to improve the taxpayer experience. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS conduct a skills gap analysis specific to Appeals mission needs and develop a strategy for mitigating any identified gaps. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations and plans to provide detailed corrective action plans in its 60-day letter response to Congress.",
    "gao_GAO-19-200": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government provides employment and training (E&T) services to help individuals enhance their job skills, identify job opportunities, or help job seekers obtain employment. GAO has issued several reports on fragmentation, overlap, and potential for duplication among federally funded E&T programs and identified areas where inefficiencies might result. GAO was asked to review federal E&T programs. This report examines (1) how participation in and obligations for federal E&T programs have changed since GAO's 2011 report, (2) the extent to which E&T programs continue to provide similar services to similar populations, and examples of potential effects, and (3) the extent to which agencies have taken actions to address previously identified fragmentation and overlap among the programs and lessons learned. GAO analyzed federal agency data on E&T obligations and services provided, surveyed agency officials, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The number of federally funded employment and training (E&T) programs has decreased since GAO's 2011 report on them. For fiscal year 2017, GAO identified 43 programs, four fewer than GAO reported in 2011. The number decreased because more programs were eliminated or defunded (6) than added (2). For example, in 2014, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) eliminated at least four of GAO's identified E&T programs. This included 1) the Department of Labor's Veterans' Workforce Investment Program, 2) Education's Grants to States for Workplace and Community Transition Training for Incarcerated Individuals, 3) Education's Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Program, and 4) Education's Projects with Industry program. In addition, Congress did not appropriate funds for Education's Tech Prep Education State Grants in fiscal year 2011 and DOL's Community Based Job Training Grants programs in fiscal year 2010, according to agencies' budget documents. GAO also identified two additional E&T programs through interviews with agency officials and a related GAO report: 1) Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Compensated Work Therapy, and 2) Department of Defense's Job Training, Employment Skills Training, Apprenticeships, and Internships. The 43 E&T programs generally overlap in that they provide similar services to similar populations, according to GAO's survey analysis. In GAO's survey, almost all of the 43 programs reported providing employment counseling and assessment services as well as job search or job placement activities (39), job readiness training (38), and job referrals (37). The least commonly provided service selected from GAO's list of service categories-high school completion or equivalency assistance-was provided by over half (26) of the programs. The 43 E&T programs generally overlap in that they provide similar services to similar populations, according to GAO's survey analysis. In GAO's survey, eight of the 43 programs reported serving the general population (that is, a relatively broad target) and the remaining 35 reported serving a narrower target population, such as Native Americans, veterans and transitioning servicemembers, or youth. GAO's survey analysis shows overlap in services exists among programs serving the general population as well as among those serving each specific target population. Specifically, a majority of programs targeting the general population, Native Americans, and youth reported providing many of the same services. However, when multiple programs overlap or are fragmented, there is also a risk that program administrators may not make efficient use of available resources if they do not coordinate their efforts. Without careful coordination, programs may not fully leverage mutual benefits or participants may find administrative requirements burdensome or redundant. GAO's survey analysis showed that almost all (38) of the 43 E&T programs reported taking at least one action to manage fragmentation, overlap, and/or potential duplication. Common actions included providing program guidance and technical assistance, coordinating participant services (e.g., co-locating services or co-enrolling participants), and effectively managing grants. However, effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain. Agencies administering E&T programs did not consistently have information on results to know how well their actions to manage program fragmentation and overlap were working. DOL officials told GAO that they generally had not assessed the actions they reported in GAO's survey to manage overlap, fragmentation, and potential for duplication, but noted that the agency has begun an implementation study of WIOA that will include examining state and local efforts to increase program coordination and collaboration. DOL expects the final report will be completed in fall 2019, and agency officials said it is coordinating with other agency partners. Agencies reported completing additional impact studies since GAO's 2011 review, but evaluations examining their programs' effects have generally been confined to a single program and/or specific target populations.

The Secret Service, with help from the Coast Guard and DOD, plays a vital role in protecting the President during his travels. The Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 was intended to establish procedures to control the expenditure of federal funds for protection at nongovernmental properties; it requires that each of these entities report expenditures under the Act. The Act also requires that GAO report on the costs associated with protecting the President and others. This report examines (1) the costs associated with the President's four trips to Mar-a-Lago from February 3, 2017 to March 5, 2017, and (2) the extent to which the Secret Service and DOD have reported costs as required under the Act. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, interviewed agency officials, and analyzed data from the Secret Service and DOD. What GAO Found For the President's four trips to Mar-a-Lago from February 3, 2017 to March 5, 2017, GAO estimates that federal agencies incurred costs of about $13.6 million. These costs consisted of approximately $10.6 million for operating costs and $3.0 million for temporary duty costs. DOD and the Department of Homeland Security incurred the majority of these costs\u2014about $8.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The Secret Service incurred about $1.6 million to provide support. This included per diem and other related travel expenses, such as commercial airfare or use of rental cars for officials traveling in advance of the President. The Secret Service and the Coast Guard incurred the majority of these costs\u2014about $3.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The Secret Service and the Coast Guard have not reported costs as required under the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, GAO found that, of the three agencies required to report costs incurred for protecting the President and others under the Presidential Protection Assistance Act, only the Coast Guard reported semiannually on costs under the Act. The Secret Service did not do so consistently, and DOD did not report any protection costs during this time frame. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secret Service and DOD define requirements for producing semiannual reports of expenditures required by the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976, and an oversight mechanism to ensure that the Secret Service consistently submits these reports to specified congressional committees. DOD and the Secret Service concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-36": "Why GAO Did This Study Improper payments are a significant source of federal revenues, with about $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2016 improper payments. GAO was asked to review the extent to which agencies are complying with the requirements of the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended. This report examines the extent to which (1) the 24 CFO Act agencies followed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance for reporting on improper payment risk assessments in their agency financial reports (AFR) or performance and accountability reports (PAR) for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and (2) selected CFO Act agencies have designed control activities to include all of their programs and activities in an improper payment risk assessment at least once during a 3-year period, as required by IPIA. GAO analyzed the 24 CFO Act agencies' fiscal years 2014 through 2016 AFRs and PARs and reviewed the CFO Act agencies' procedures for conducting improper payment risk assessments. GAO also interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 24 Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) Act agencies, excluding the Department of Defense (DOD), reported in their AFRs or PARs that they completed at least one risk assessment on at least one program or activity in one or more of those years. For the agencies that reported that they completed an improper payment risk assessment, GAO found that most generally adhered to the reporting directives that were applicable for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. For example, for fiscal year 2014, 21 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported completing a risk assessment, and for those 21 agencies, GAO found that 19 agencies adhered to OMB guidance for reporting the basis for grouping programs and activities and 2 did not. For fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the 24 CFO Act agencies, except for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), adhered to the reporting directive for listing all programs and activities assessed during the agencies' improper payment risk assessments. USAID did not adhere to this reporting directive in fiscal year 2015; however, in fiscal year 2016, USAID did list all programs and activities. Officials from these three agencies indicated that they plan to report the risk factors considered, as directed by OMB, which should include consideration of all nine risk factors. GAO found that three of the nine selected CFO Act agencies that GAO reviewed, Energy, the Department of Justice, and USAID, had documented procedures for performing the required improper payment risk assessments and these procedures included the design of control activities necessary to help ensure that all programs and activities were assessed at least once every 3 years. However, the remaining six agencies did not properly design control activities for this purpose. Specifically, three of these six selected agencies did not have documented procedures for performing the required improper payment risk assessments. The remaining three agencies improperly excluded specific programs and activities from the improper payment risk assessment process. GAO did not evaluate whether all control activities related to conducting improper payment risk assessments were properly designed or evaluated other internal control components, such as the control environment. If GAO had done so, additional deficiencies may or may not have been identified that could impair the overall effectiveness of the control activities evaluated as part of this audit. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Administrator of NASA take steps to revise its procedures for conducting improper payment risk assessments to include the activities of its Office of Inspector General (OIG) in its risk assessment process to help ensure that all programs and activities are assessed for susceptibility to significant improper payments at least once every 3 years as required by IPIA. NASA concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-177": "Why GAO Did This Study The FAA is responsible for providing air navigation services, including air traffic control, across most of the United States, and is leading the overall NextGen effort in the United States. The FAA's ADS-B Out technology is a performance-based surveillance technology that uses GPS-enabled satellites to produce flight information, such as an aircraft's location and velocity. The FAA has not issued a rule or requirement for aircraft to equip with ADS-B Out technology, as of July 2017. GAO was asked to review the implementation of ADS-B Out. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the Department of Defense (DOD) and the FAA have identified security and operations risks and approved solutions to address these risks to military aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out technology; and (2) DOD has implemented key tasks in the 2007 Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum on implementing NextGen. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from DOD, FAA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NORAD) on potential risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies. What GAO Found Since 2008, DOD and FAA have identified a variety of ADS-B-related risks that could adversely affect military security and missions. These risks arise from information broadcasted by ADS-B itself, as well as from potential ADS-B vulnerabilities to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks, and from the potential divestment of secondary-surveillance radars. DOD and FAA have identified some potential mitigations for these risks, but the departments have not approved any solutions. For example, DOD and FAA have not focused on solving or mitigating security risks from ADS-B. The approach being taken by FAA and DOD will not address key security risks that have been identified, and delays in producing an interagency agreement have significantly reduced the time available to implement any agreed-upon solutions before January 1, 2020, when the full deployment of ADS-B Out is required. Federal internal control standards state that federal agencies should make risk-based decisions in a timely manner. In the case of equipping military aircraft with ADS-B technology and addressing any risks associated with it, DOD and FAA have shared responsibility. In 2008, DOD informed FAA that military aircraft would need special accommodations to the ADS-B Out rule due to national security concerns, such as sensitive missions and electronic warfare vulnerabilities. In 2010 FAA responded to DOD's comments to the draft ADS-B Out rule stating that the agency would collaborate with departments or agencies, including DOD and the Department of Homeland Security, to develop memorandums of agreement to accommodate their national defense mission requirements while supporting the needs of all other national airspace system users. Since that time, DOD components have identified such mitigations as masking DOD aircraft identifiers, maintaining current inventory of primary-surveillance radars, allowing pilots to turn off ADS-B broadcasts, and seeking an exemption from installing ADS-B technology on select military aircraft (for example, fighter and bomber aircraft). However, as of June 2017\u2014almost 7 years after FAA acknowledged that it would address DOD's concerns (and less than 3 years before full deployment of ADS-B Out is required)\u2014DOD and FAA have not approved any solutions to these risks. The approach being taken by FAA and DOD will not address key security risks that have been identified, and delays in producing an interagency agreement have significantly reduced the time available to implement any agreed-upon solutions before January 1, 2020, when the full deployment of ADS-B Out is required. Federal internal control standards state that federal agencies should make risk-based decisions in a timely manner. Unless FAA and DOD focus on the security risks of ADS-B and approve one or more solutions in a timely fashion, they may not have time to plan for and execute any technical, programmatic, or policy actions that may be necessary before all of DOD's aircraft are required to be equipped with ADS-B technology on January 1, 2020. Of the eight tasks associated with the implementation of ADS-B Out technology in the 2007 Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum\u2014issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to ensure that the NextGen vision for the future national airspace system met DOD's requirements and the appropriate management of DOD's resources\u2014DOD has implemented two, has partially implemented four, and has not implemented two. Specifically, GAO found that DOD has implemented two, has partially implemented four, and has not implemented two. Specifically, GAO found that DOD has implemented the following two tasks: (1) Validating NextGen program requirements. The",
    "gao_GAO-18-478": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S.-flag vessels are a critical part of the U.S. government's sealift capacity. The MSP provides financial support to U.S.-flag vessels to help meet national defense needs. GAO was asked to review the MSP. This report examines (1) the extent to which the MSP has helped meet national defense needs and (2) the challenges the U.S.-flag fleet faces in meeting national defense needs. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed MSP and cargo preference data; and interviewed officials from DOD, MARAD, and 14 MSP vessel operators. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), and State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). What GAO Found The Maritime Security Program (MSP) has helped meet national defense needs by providing financial support to U.S.-flag vessels through both the MSP stipend and the cargo preference requirements. For example, the MSP stipend provides a fixed financial incentive for vessel operators to maintain vessels under the U.S. flag, but on its own is not sufficient to support the higher costs of operating U.S.-flag vessels. In contrast, while cargo preference requirements are a means of providing government support to U.S.-flag vessels, these requirements have had a negative impact on some non-defense programs. For example, the requirement that food aid agencies send a certain percentage of food aid on U.S.-flag vessels has resulted in higher shipping costs for these agencies, and USAID and USDA officials stated that this has reduced the amount of funds the agencies can spend on their mission to reduce hunger. Stakeholders GAO spoke with identified two primary challenges to ensuring that the U.S.-flag fleet would continue to meet national defense needs. First, stakeholders described maintaining the financial viability of U.S.-flag vessels participating in the MSP as a challenge. Second, stakeholders identified a potential shortage of U.S. citizen mariners available to crew the government-owned reserve fleet during a military activation as a challenge, in part due to the declining numbers of U.S.-flag vessels. DOT has not finalized the national maritime strategy, but MARAD has identified options to address the competitiveness of U.S.-flag vessels and the long-term viability of the U.S. Merchant Marine. DOT officials stated that they are not yet ready to address the feasibility of these options. For example, MARAD has identified options to reduce the costs of operating a U.S.-flag vessel\u2014which would in turn increase U.S.-flag vessels' competitiveness. However, DOT has not published this strategy or made any recommendations to increase U.S.-flag vessels' competitiveness or to ensure the long-term viability of the U.S.-flag fleet or U.S. citizen mariners. DOT has also not developed a timeline for when it will complete and provide this strategy to Congress. The continued lack of such a strategy limits decision-makers' ability to make policy choices related to these challenges in a comprehensive way that considers the complex issues related to the long-time government support for the U.S.-flag fleet. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) complete the national maritime strategy and establish and provide to Congress a timeline by which the strategy document will be issued. DOT agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-128": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for defending the U.S. homeland and interests from attack, including those that occur in cyberspace and has developed capabilities for cyber operations. DOD is also responsible for defending its own networks, systems, and information from cyber attack. GAO was asked to review DOD's cybersecurity of its weapon systems. This report examines (1) factors that contribute to the current state of DOD weapon systems cybersecurity, (2) the extent to which DOD focused on cybersecurity in weapon system acquisitions, and (3) the steps DOD is taking to develop more cyber resilient weapon systems. GAO reviewed reports published from 1991 to the present on software, information technology, networking, and weapon systems from the National Research Council, the Defense Science Board, and the RAND Corporation; reviewed test reports from 2012 to 2017; and interviewed officials from DOD, military test organizations, and test organizations. What GAO Found Multiple factors contribute to the current state of the Department of Defense's (DOD) weapon systems cybersecurity, including: the increasingly computerized and networked nature of DOD weapon systems, DOD's past failure to prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity, and DOD's nascent understanding of how best to develop more cyber secure weapon systems. Specifically, DOD weapon systems are more software and information technology dependent and more networked than ever before. This has transformed weapon capabilities and is a fundamental enabler of the United States' modern military capabilities. Yet this change has come at a cost. More weapon components can now be attacked using cyber capabilities. Furthermore, networks can be used as a pathway to attack other systems. GAO and others have warned of these risks for decades. Nevertheless, until recently, DOD did not prioritize cybersecurity in weapon systems acquisitions. In part because DOD historically focused on the cybersecurity of its networks but not weapon systems themselves, DOD is in the early stage of trying to understand how to apply cybersecurity to weapon systems. Several DOD officials explained that it will take some time, and possibly some missteps, for the department to learn what works and does not work with respect to weapon systems cybersecurity. GAO found that from 2012 to 2017, DOD testers routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems that were under development. Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of these systems and largely operate undetected. In some cases, system operators were unable to effectively respond to the hacks. Furthermore, DOD does not know the full scale of its weapon system vulnerabilities because, for a number of reasons, tests were limited in scope and sophistication. DOD has taken several major steps to improve weapon systems cybersecurity. DOD issued and updated numerous policies and guidance to improve the department's development of cyber resilient systems. These include improvements such as specifying that cybersecurity policies apply to weapon systems and requiring more focus on cybersecurity throughout a weapon system's acquisition life cycle. DOD and Congress have also begun promising initiatives to help DOD improve its understanding of its weapon systems cyber vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate their risks. However, DOD faces barriers that may limit its ability to achieve desired improvements. For example, DOD is struggling to hire and retain cybersecurity personnel, who are essential to implementing these changes. In addition, DOD faces barriers to information sharing, which hinder its ability to share vulnerability and threat information within and across programs. To improve the state of weapon systems cybersecurity, it is essential that DOD sustain its momentum in developing and implementing key initiatives. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated where appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-126": "Why GAO Did This Study NNSA is responsible for supplying tritium to meet its tritium production needs. NNSA is also responsible for supplying tritium to meet other national security and other enriched uranium needs. NNSA is also developing a new uranium enrichment capability to produce tritium. GAO was asked to review NNSA's plans to extend its existing inventories of enriched uranium to address its near-term tritium needs. This report examines (1) the actions NNSA is taking to extend its existing inventories of enriched uranium to address near-term tritium needs and the costs, schedules, and risks of those actions; (2) the extent to which NNSA's plan to analyze options for supplying enriched uranium in the long term is consistent with Department of Energy (DOE) directives; and (3) NNSA's preliminary cost estimates for long-term uranium enrichment technology options and the extent to which they meet best practices for reliable estimates. GAO analyzed NNSA planning documents, interviewed DOE and NNSA officials, and visited three uranium enrichment facilities. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is taking or plans to take four actions to extend its existing inventories of enriched uranium to address its near-term tritium needs. These actions would together extend the supply of unobligated enriched uranium (LEU) from 2027 until approximately 2038 to 2041, according to NNSA documents. NNSA first identified the actions to extend its unobligated LEU supply based on an analysis completed by the Department of Energy (DOE) Uranium Inventory Working Group, which was convened by NNSA in September 2014 to analyze the department's uranium inventory and identify material and options to provide unobligated LEU for tritium production reactors. NNSA's October 2015 plan, which was based on a 2014 DOE Uranium Inventory Working Group assessment of near-term NNSA actions, estimated that the total cost of the four actions would be approximately $1.1 billion from fiscal years 2016 through 2025 and would provide additional quantities of unobligated LEU for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to meet NNSA's tritium needs through 2038 to 2041. NNSA and GAO have identified some risks associated with two of these actions. One of these risks has been resolved; NNSA is taking steps to mitigate another; while other risks, such as the uncertainty of future appropriations, are unresolved. NNSA's preliminary plan\u2014as outlined in its domestic uranium enrichment mission need statement\u2014to analyze options for supplying enriched uranium in the long term is inconsistent with DOE directives. This is because the scope of the mission need statement can be interpreted to fulfill multiple mission needs, which is inconsistent with DOE directives that such a statement should be a clear and concise description of the gap between current capabilities and the mission need. Under either interpretation of the mission need statement, NNSA is not complying with these directives because it is showing preference toward a particular solution\u2014building a new uranium enrichment capability\u2014and the agency has not included other options for analysis. In the mission need statement, NNSA has preliminarily identified two uranium enrichment technologies as the most feasible options for reestablishing a uranium enrichment capability, but both face deployment challenges. NNSA's preliminary cost estimates for the two uranium enrichment technology options it considers most feasible\u2014the large and small centrifuge\u2014are limited in scope and do not fully meet best practices for reliable cost estimates, including those for early stages of acquisition. GAO found that the large centrifuge cost estimate partially met the characteristics of being comprehensive and credible, and minimally met the characteristics of being well-documented and accurate. The small centrifuge cost estimate only partially met the characteristics of being well-documented and accurate. By developing reliable cost estimates consistent with best practices, NNSA will reasonably ensure that it has reliable information to make an informed decision about which option to select. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NNSA revise the scope of its mission need statement to clarify which mission need it seeks to achieve and, as appropriate, adjust the range of options considered in the analysis of alternatives process. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-288": "Why GAO Did This Study VAPIHCS provides primary and mental health care services to eligible veterans who reside in Hawaii and the three U.S. territories in the Pacific. VAPIHCS provides most specialty care and inpatient services to veterans at military treatment facilities through joint venture and sharing agreements with DOD or through non-VA providers in the community. GAO was asked to review VAPIHCS's efforts to provide timely care to veterans. This report examines (1) the extent to which veterans receive primary and mental health care from VA providers within VHA's timeliness goals, (2) the extent to which VAPIHCS has faced physician recruitment and retention challenges, and (3) the extent to which VAPIHCS has used strategies to improve veterans' access to health care. GAO reviewed VHA policies, procedures, and data; analyzed a random sample of 30 medical records for veterans who accessed primary and mental health care services at three clinics in the Pacific Islands; and interviewed VAPIHCS and DOD officials. What GAO Found GAO found that most veterans in GAO's review received primary and mental health care from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) providers within the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) timeliness goal, although some veterans faced delays in contacting veterans to schedule appointments. VAPIHCS referred 67 of 69 randomly selected specialty care referrals in GAO's sample to non-VA providers in the Choice Program or through DOD providers within 7 days, in accordance with VHA policy. Specifically, VAPIHCS referred 28 of 30 specialty care referrals sent to Choice Program providers, and all 39 specialty care referrals sent to DOD providers at two military treatment facilities. VAPIHCS staff took an average of 2 days to review and send referrals to VAPIHCS staff responsible for Choice Program referrals, and an average of 1 day to review and send specialty care referrals to two military treatment facilities. GAO found that the number of days from the referral's creation to the date that veterans received care from Choice Program providers varied by clinic, and ranged from 19 to 239 days, with the average being 75 days. GAO found that VAPIHCS staff did not always manage referrals to the Naval Hospital Guam (NHG) in a timely manner. For example, VAPIHCS staff did not always monitor the availability of services at NHG with the frequency necessary to ensure the timeliness of referral management. GAO found that VAPIHCS staff did not always manage referrals to NHG in a timely manner. For example, VAPIHCS staff did not always ensure that referrals were entered into NHG's electronic medical record system in a timely manner to begin the appointment scheduling process. VAPIHCS has faced physician recruitment and retention challenges, but has not evaluated the strategies it uses to help resolve them. For example, VAPIHCS has used many of the VHA strategies used at VAMCs nationwide to help with its physician recruitment and retention efforts. However, VAPIHCS has not evaluated the strategies it uses to determine their effectiveness, or if additional strategies offered by VHA might be appropriate. Without evaluating the strategies currently used to determine their effectiveness, or determining if additional strategies offered by VHA might be appropriate, VAPIHCS risks missing the opportunity to target its efforts to those strategies that have the greatest potential to ameliorate long-standing staffing shortages. Veterans face a number of challenges accessing health care services on the Pacific Islands, and VAPIHCS uses several strategies to improve veterans' access to health care. For example, veterans face challenges accessing health care services due to the lack of certain specialty care providers on many of the islands, the significant travel that is required to obtain these services, and limitations associated with telehealth services. VAPIHCS has utilized a system of travelling VAPIHCS providers and is working to improve its use of telehealth services to better ensure veterans' timely access to care, among other strategies. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA review its referral process for referrals to DOD providers, including referral cancellation, to determine why VAPIHCS policy is not being adhered to and make changes as needed. VA concurred with three of GAO's four recommendations and provided information on its plans to address them.",

DEC has recovered millions of dollars in inappropriately used HUD program funds, suspended or debarred some individuals, and helped strengthen program offices' monitoring efforts. GAO was asked to review DEC. This report examines (1) the processes that selected HUD program offices have in place to make referrals to DEC, (2) how DEC assesses its performance, and (3) challenges that may affect the ability of DEC to achieve its mission. GAO reviewed relevant HUD documents and data, and interviewed HUD officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal internal control standards and federal internal control standards. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC) and the three HUD program offices GAO examined have agreements in place that generally describe the process the offices follow to make referrals to DEC and the responsibilities of the parties. However, two of the three program offices (the Community Planning and Development (CPD) and Multifamily Housing (MFH)) do not provide their staff with specific guidance for making referrals, and the target number of referrals these two offices have established to send to DEC does not address the risk of noncompliance. PIH and CPD field office staff use their discretion in deciding which cases to refer to DEC, but these decisions do not appear to always be based on well-supported assessments of risk. Without specific guidance to help staff direct their decision making, DEC and the program offices cannot ensure that referrals are made using a consistent and risk-based approach, limiting DEC's effectiveness in fulfilling its mission of providing independent oversight of HUD's programs. The target number of referrals that PIH and CPD aim to make to DEC appears to have been selected somewhat arbitrarily, rather than based on the risks to the programs. Without a determination of appropriate risk-based target numbers, PIH and CPD cannot ensure that they are using DEC resources efficiently to address the risks of noncompliance by housing agencies and grantees. DEC currently tracks some measures related to its performance, but its performance measurement system is lacking in key respects that limit DEC's ability to fully assess its performance. For example, DEC's performance measures do not include outcome measures, which track the results of products and services. Instead, the performance measures track outputs, which are the direct products and services delivered by a program. Federal internal control standards state that agency management should define objectives in measurable terms so that performance toward those objectives can be assessed. Consistent with those standards, GAO identified several challenges with DEC's system of performance measurement.

However, the number of abortions performed in the United States has steadily declined over the past 30 years, with the most recent year data available\u2014the most recent year available\u2014at 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age. GAO was asked to review issues related to accessing abortions in the Medicaid program. This report examines (1) factors that may present challenges to women accessing abortions, and (2) the extent to which federal data on abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding are complete and the number of abortions covered across states. GAO analyzed relevant literature and interviewed federal officials and selected abortion providers. GAO also surveyed all states that claimed federal Medicaid funding for abortions from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. GAO also interviewed eight selected abortion providers selected based on their Medicaid coverage and provider availability. What GAO Found Multiple factors could present challenges to women accessing abortions depending on where she lives. GAO identified seven key factors as potential challenges to women accessing abortions based on interviews with eight selected providers: (1) gestational limits; (2) mandatory counseling; (3) out-of-pocket costs; (4) parental involvement; (5) provider availability; (6) stigma and harassment; and (7) waiting periods. GAO reviewed 52 studies examining the key abortion access factors identified through interviews with selected abortion providers, though some factors were studied more than others. In responding to a GAO survey, 29 states reported limiting abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to the three circumstances required under federal law\u2014rape, incest, and life endangerment\u2014while 21 states reported broader abortion coverage. The remaining state, South Dakota, reported that it limits abortion coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries to circumstances when the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman, and does not cover abortions in cases of rape or incest. CMS confirmed that South Dakota's Medicaid state plan does not include coverage of abortions in cases of rape or incest, and shared a letter it sent to the state in 1994 outlining that the state's coverage did not comply with federal law and expressing CMS's intent to work with the state on possible solutions. However, according to CMS officials, the agency has not taken any action since that time to ensure South Dakota's compliance, and does not have plans to do so. As a result, Medicaid beneficiaries in South Dakota do not have Medicaid coverage for abortions in cases of rape or incest. The usefulness of federal information\u2014namely CMS-64 data\u2014for identifying the number of abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding is limited, which could hamper CMS's efforts to ensure proper payments and states' coverage of abortions in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. In particular, the CMS-64 does not include information on abortions eligible for federal funding provided to Medicaid beneficiaries through managed care organizations (MCO), because states are not required to identify expenditures for individual managed care services on the form. In GAO's survey, 23 states reported claiming federal Medicaid funding for abortions from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 that were, at least in part, paid for through MCOs. However, the information on abortions eligible for federal funding that states reported to GAO was also incomplete. Nine states, accounting for about one-third of total Medicaid enrollment, were unable to provide any information. These states use only state funds to pay for abortions, and, for example, do not require providers to report the circumstance for the abortion when requesting Medicaid payment, including those eligible for federal funding. In addition, incomplete federal data on the number of abortions eligible for federal Medicaid funding\u2014in part, due to inaccuracies that GAO identified in the reporting of these expenditures by eight states\u2014limit the agency's ability to ensure that states are covering such abortions and that federal payments are made appropriately. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS take action to ensure South Dakota's Medicaid state plan provides coverage for abortions in cases of rape and incest, in addition to life endangerment, to comply with federal law, which currently requires such coverage. CMS agreed with these recommendations, but as of October 2018, the agency had not fully implemented them, and GAO continues to believe that these recommendations remain valid.",

The FSIA requires that plaintiffs file a request for service before requesting that State complete service through the diplomatic channel. GAO was asked to review State's process for completing service. This report examines (1) how State completes service under the FSIA and how long it takes to perform this function and (2) whether State has implemented key controls in record-keeping, monitoring, analysis and performance management for completing service requests. GAO analyzed State and court data from 2007 through 2017, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed State and embassy officials. What GAO Found The Department of State (State) completes service through four stages involving the courts, the Department of State, U.S. embassies, and foreign ministries through a process that took about 5 months to complete on average for the period 2007 through 2017. The process involves numerous steps and requires action by litigants, courts, and the State Department, but can be summarized in four stages: 1. Preparing and submitting a request for service to State. Plaintiffs' attorneys compile and submit the required documentation to the relevant clerk of court, who transmits the package to State. This documentation must include two copies of the complaint, summons and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each into the official language of the foreign state, or where a plaintiff has obtained a default judgment against a foreign state, translated copies of that default judgment and a notice of default judgment, as well as a cashier's check made out to the appropriate U.S. embassy for the applicable fee. 2. Receiving and processing the request at State. State's Office of the Legal Affairs (OCS/L) within the Bureau of Consular Affairs administers the diplomatic service provisions of the FSIA. The steps involved are numerous and require action by litigants, courts, and the State Department, but can be summarized in four stages: 1. Preparing and submitting a request for service. Plaintiffs' attorneys compile and submit the required documentation to the relevant clerk of court, who transmits the package to State. This documentation must include two copies of the complaint, summons and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each into the official language of the foreign state, or where a plaintiff has obtained a default judgment against a foreign state, translated copies of that default judgment and a notice of default judgment, as well as a cashier's check made out to the appropriate U.S. embassy for the applicable fee. 3. Receiving and processing a request at U.S. embassies and working with protecting powers. 4. Notifying the court that service has been completed. Once service has been completed, the package is sent back to OCS/L for delivery to the clerk of court. The most time-consuming stage to complete service was the period in Washington, D.C. in which State Headquarters completes document review and clearance. Although neither the FSIA, State's implementing regulations, nor federal rules of civil procedure establish a time limit for State to complete service, the length of time State takes to complete service can affect plaintiffs' compensation. According to plaintiffs' attorneys, slow service could adversely affect victims' ability to obtain compensation for two reasons. First, slow service can lengthen the time it takes to obtain a final judgment against a foreign government, thereby delaying plaintiffs' ability to satisfy judgments through asset seizures or to apply for compensation from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (Fund). Second, slow service can reduce the total award that claimants receive from the Fund. For example, slow service could result in plaintiffs being unable to provide the required documentation before the deadline of a particular round of distributions for the Fund. The deadline for the 2019 distribution was September 14, 2018. The Fund's procedures allow victims to apply for compensation after a court has issued a default judgment that includes compensation against the defendant government in their case and following their transmittal of a request for service of the default judgment through State. The Fund's procedures allow victims to apply for compensation after a court has issued a default judgment that includes compensation against the defendant government in their case and following their transmittal of a request for service of the default judgment through State. The Fund's procedures allow victims to apply for compensation after a court has issued a default judgment that includes compensation against the defendant government in their case and following their transmittal of a request for service of the default judgment through State.

    "gao_GAO-19-21": "Why GAO Did This Study VHA is responsible for ensuring that medical centers provide a safe, clean, functional environment for patients, visitors, and employees. VHA requires medical centers to conduct environment of care inspections of the facility to identify deficiencies and address them. GAO was asked to review VHA's environment of care program. This report examines (1) the extent to which medical centers implement the environment of care inspection process, and (2) the extent to which VHA has goals and measures to determine program effectiveness. GAO reviewed VHA guidance and inspections data, and interviewed VHA officials and medical center staff at six medical centers selected based on size, location, and other factors. GAO also visited all six medical centers and interviewed officials from all six medical centers. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) relys on environment of care inspections to identify deficiencies but may encounter challenges in completing needed repairs. The inspections process identifies deficiencies, such as loose floor tiles or ceiling tiles stained or other signs of leaks. Medical center staff said that the most common environment of care deficiencies can be addressed by medical center staff, but medical centers told GAO they sometimes use contractors if warranted. In most cases, a deficiency can be addressed with simple repairs such as patching and repainting walls, replacing stained and damaged tiles, or by cleaning. The buildings that VHA manages are, on average, 55 years old, and many have substantial capital repair and improvement needs. A VA-commissioned report noted that there were significant barriers that facility management staff faced in maintaining facilities to a high quality. According to the report, while some of these barriers involved immediate resource constraints such as budgets for staffing and conducting maintenance and janitorial tasks, the root cause of many of these issues is the general age and underlying condition of VHA facilities. Workload Engineering officials at medical centers told GAO that the amount of work associated with conducting weekly inspections and addressing environment of care deficiencies is substantial. For example, according to VHA's data for fiscal year 2017, medical centers reported conducting about 11,000 weekly inspections, during which more than 128,000 deficiencies were identified. Most deficiencies were closed within 14 business days, as required by VHA policy, but nearly 30,000 deficiencies across all medical centers had not been addressed within 14 days or had been addressed through a plan for future work. One significant factor contributing to the number of deficiencies and the associated workload is the advanced age of many medical centers. A VHA commissioned study found that the general age and underlying condition of medical centers, including VHA buildings' being older than 50 years on average and lack of capital investment to address infrastructure concerns, are the root causes of many barriers that facility management staff faced in achieving their objectives of maintaining high quality facilities, and exacerbate the workload issues at these medical centers. While VHA provides guidance and oversight to ensure medical centers implement the environment of care inspection process, it lacks performance goals, objectives, and measures that would enable it to assess how well it is achieving its policy of a clean, safe, and functional environment. GAO has previously found that results-oriented organizations set performance goals to define desired program outcomes and develop performance measures that are clearly linked to these performance goals and outcomes. Program goals communicate what results the agency seeks, and performance measures show the progress the agency is making toward achieving program goals. Performance measurement also gives managers crucial information to identify gaps in program performance and plan any needed improvements. Without such goals and measures in place, VHA is limited in its ability to effectively manage the Environment of Care Program, including making effective use of program data and addressing obstacles to improving program performance. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA set a timeline for defining goals, objectives, and outcome-oriented performance measures for the Environment of Care Program. VA concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-140": "Why GAO Did This Study The Bureau's 2018 Census Test was intended to test key procedures, management approaches, and systems under decennial-like conditions prior to the 2020 Census. The Bureau's testing of the peak operations that GAO observed during the 2018 Census Test was intended to test collection of census data from those either not responding themselves via paper, telephone, or over the Internet or those living in group quarters. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's implementation of the 2018 Census Test. This report examines (1) how peak field operations were implemented during the 2018 Census Test; and (2) the extent to which implementation issues raised in prior 2020 Census tests have been addressed, and what actions the Bureau is taking to address them. GAO reviewed Bureau test planning documentation and prior reports and documentation on prior census testing operations; observed field operations at multiple sites; and interviewed Bureau officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) began the last phase of NRFU data collection in the 2018 Census Test without having yet determined the procedures it would use for that critical phase. Bureau planning documentation from February 2018 described a late-operation \"closeout\" phase of NRFU that would attempt to resolve cases that had not yet responded. However, GAO found that the Bureau had not determined the procedural modifications this phase would involve, either in terms of rules enumerators followed or business rules for how cases were to be assigned. By late May, nearly 3 weeks into the operation, the Bureau issued a set of closeout procedures to census areas where most cases had either been completed or where at least four of the six allowable enumeration attempt day assignments had been made. The Bureau also placed a priority on having high-performing enumerators\u2014in terms of their ability to complete cases\u2014available to work these cases during this phase of the NRFU testing. The Bureau also placed a priority on having high-performing enumerators\u2014in terms of their ability to complete cases\u2014available to work these cases during this phase of the NRFU testing. By not determining the procedural changes the Bureau would be testing\u2014or the business rules guiding when to make those changes\u2014the Bureau was not well positioned to collect data to assess the alternatives it used during the test to inform planning for 2020. The Bureau did not fully ready its field workforce for enumeration challenges. Census field supervisors were not integrated into casework management. Census field supervisors were not aligned with the authority supervisors were given, the skills for which the Bureau hired them, or the access to information that they had for the 2018 test. By not establishing the scope and timing of procedural changes for late-NRFU data collection in 2020, the Bureau may not be in a position to efficiently shift from its automated assignment approach to a manual one at the right time and position its most effective enumerators to receive assignments when needed. The Bureau is assessing other implementation issues that occurred during the 2018 Census Test. For example, the Bureau's automated case management system was not configured for non-Headquarters staff to manually assign multiple cases to an enumerator at once. Bureau officials acknowledged the unsustainability of this work-around if needed at a national level and the importance of resolving this before the 2020 Census. The Bureau has made progress but continues to face challenges addressing implementation issues identified in prior tests. For example, enumerators did not always understand how to report fieldwork issues to their supervisors. Moreover, the Bureau continues to assess how to ensure efficient staffing levels for Group Quarters. During the 2018 Census Test, the Bureau experienced a programming error while implementing procedures for proxy interviews. The Bureau agreed with GAO's recommendation to revise and test procedural and training modifications as needed to aid enumerators and their supervisors in these cases. The Bureau agreed with this recommendation and indicated that the evaluations of the 2018 test would inform its strategies for 2020. However, GAO observed a similar issue during the 2018 Census Test in that enumerators were uncertain of how to proceed when property managers were unavailable. Continuing to review the procedures and guidance to enumerators on this flexibility for completing interviews, consistent with GAO's prior recommendation, will help the Bureau make better use of it in 2020. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Commerce (1) determine in advance of Non-Response Follow-Up what the procedural changes will be for the last phases of its data collection and what the business rules will be for determining when to begin those phases, which cases to assign, and how to assign them; (2) enable census field supervisors to prepare targeted, mid-operation training or guidance as needed to",
    "gao_GAO-18-382": "Why GAO Did This Study Lead in school drinking water can cause health effects, including increased risk of premature births. EPA and Education have encouraged schools to test for lead in drinking water and support actions to reduce children's exposure to lead. GAO was asked to review the extent to which school districts are testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water. This report examines (1) the extent to which school districts are testing for, finding, and remediating lead in school drinking water; (2) the extent to which states require or support testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water by school districts; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts to test for and remediate lead. GAO surveyed a stratified random sample of school districts in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and interviewed officials from EPA, Education, and CDC. GAO also visited five states selected based on geographic location and population density. What GAO Found An estimated 43 percent of school districts tested for lead in school drinking water, but 41 percent did not, and 16 percent did not know. An estimated 35 million students were enrolled in districts that tested as compared with 12 million students in districts that did not test. An estimated 16 percent of school districts, enrolling about 6 million students, reported that they did not know whether they had tested or not. Of those that tested, an estimated 37 percent found elevated lead levels\u2014levels of lead above the district's threshold for taking remedial action\u2014in school drinking water. School districts varied in whether they tested for lead in school drinking water and whether they discovered elevated levels of lead. For example, an estimated 88 percent of the largest 100 school districts tested compared with 42 percent of other school districts. All school districts that found elevated lead reported taking steps to reduce or eliminate the lead, including replacing water fountains or flushing pipes. Several states require school districts to test for lead in drinking water and additional states provide funding and technical assistance to support those efforts. EPA provides several voluntary resources, such as guidance, training, and technical assistance, to states and school districts regarding testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water, but some school districts GAO surveyed and officials GAO interviewed said more information would be helpful. EPA's 3Ts guidance emphasizes the importance of taking action to remediate elevated lead in school drinking water, but the agency's guidance on a recommended action level for states and school districts is not current and contains elements that could be misleading. EPA officials said that the action level in the 3Ts guidance is not a health-based standard. However, there are statements in the guidance that appear to suggest otherwise. For example, the guidance states that EPA strongly recommends that all water outlets in all schools that provide water for drinking or cooking meet a \u201cstandard\u201d of 20 parts per billion (ppb) lead or less and that school officials who follow the steps included in the document, including using a 20 ppb action level, will be \u201cassured\u201d that school facilities do not have elevated lead in the drinking water. The use of the terms \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cassured\u201d are potentially misleading and could suggest that the 20 ppb action level is protective of health. EPA officials said that they would consider updating the 3Ts guidance, including the action level, as they consider revisions to the Lead Contamination Control Act (LCR), which may include a change in the action level from one that is based on technical feasibility, to one that also considers lead exposure in vulnerable populations such as infants and young children, which EPA refers to as a health-based benchmark. By updating the 3Ts guidance to include an action level for school districts that incorporates available scientific modeling regarding vulnerable population exposures, EPA could have greater assurance that school districts are able to limit children's exposure to lead. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EPA and Education collaborate to encourage testing for lead in school drinking water and improve their collaboration to encourage and support lead testing and remediation efforts by states and school districts. EPA and Education agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-266": "Why GAO Did This Study The Settlement Act as amended requires the Navajo Nation to relocate households and members of its lands to the Navajo Nation. The Settlement Act also requires GAO to review the Navajo Nation's administration of its lands. This report examines (1) the status of the relocation of Navajo and Hopi families and (2) the extent to which the Settlement Act has addressed housing issues in Indian communities. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from the Navajo Nation, the Department of the Interior, and other federal agencies; and reviewed documents from the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. What GAO Found The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) has changed its eligibility requirements and application deadlines for relocation benefits and has completed most of its relocation activities. For example, as of December 2017, ONHIR had certified more than 3,800 households. However, the process for certifying applicants has changed for various reasons, including the need to prompt more Navajos to relocate. Moreover, the potential exists for additional federal court appeals, potentially resulting in the need for additional eligibility determinations. As of January 2018, ONHIR officials said that 24 of the remaining 25 denied applicants have gone through the hearing process and are awaiting their decisions, which officials said should be completed in early 2018. ONHIR has nearly completed its relocation activities, but some relocatees, the Hopi tribe, and Navajo Nation government officials said that it has not completed its work. For example, some relocatees and Navajo Nation government officials said that the office should remain open to address various concerns with relocation homes and the societal effects of relocation. Moreover, according to some relocatees and Navajo Nation government officials, these concerns include homes that were built with faulty materials and with unfinished infrastructure, such as electricity. The Settlement Act states that ONHIR will cease to exist when the President of the United States determines that its functions have been fully discharged. However, ONHIR has not requested that the President make this determination. Instead of directly requesting that the President make a determination for ONHIR to cease operations, ONHIR has been making plans to close through other means and transition remaining activities. However, the Settlement Act does not include provisions on the transfer of activities after ONHIR's closure. Without legal direction to authorize the transfer of ONHIR's remaining activities to other federal entities, the future of these activities remains uncertain and may adversely affect those in the process of relocating. ONHIR has not always managed Navajo trust land in accordance with its policies. For example, as of December 2017, ONHIR has occupied or allowed others to occupy Navajo trust land it administers without a written lease, as required. Without a comprehensive inventory of leased and vacant properties on Navajo trust land it administers, the entity which assumes responsibility for leasing the land will not have the information it needs to effectively manage the properties. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Executive Director of ONHIR request a presidential determination as to whether it has fully discharged its responsibilities and whether it should close. In its comments on a draft of this report, ONHIR stated that it has had regular communications with executive and legislative branch offices on completing its work and closing. However, neither the draft transition plan nor the October 2017 implementation plan indicates how ONHIR would request a determination from the President that ONHIR has fully discharged its responsibilities and can be terminated. Without such a determination, ONHIR has not met the explicit requirements for being permitted to cease operation under the Settlement Act. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Executive Director of ONHIR request a presidential determination as to whether it has fully discharged its responsibilities and whether it should close. In its comments on a draft of this report, ONHIR stated that it has had regular communications with executive and legislative branch offices on completing its work and closing. However, neither the draft transition plan nor the October 2017 implementation plan indicates how ONHIR would request a determination from the President that ONHIR has fully discharged its responsibilities and can be terminated. GAO also recommends that the Executive Director of ONHIR develop complete information on its relocation activities and that the Secretary of the Interior and the Department of the Treasury provide necessary authority for other agencies to continue remaining activities when ONHIR closes. The Departments of the Interior and the Treasury provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-476": "Why GAO Did This Study NASA's Commercial Crew Program is a multibillion dollar effort to facilitate the commercial development of a crew transportation system that can end the United States' reliance on Russia to maintain an uninterrupted presence on the ISS. Boeing and SpaceX continue to make progress developing a capability to fly to the ISS, but both have continued to experience delays. Program analysis indicates risks of further delays in each contractor's current schedule, but NASA has not fully shared information with Congress regarding the risks of future schedule delays for the contractors and, as a result, Congress lacks insight into when the contractors will be certified. GAO was asked to review the Commercial Crew Program. This report assesses (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards meeting the Commercial Crew Program's certification requirements and NASA's plans to help ensure continued access to the ISS; and (2) how NASA's certification process addresses safety of the contractors' crew transportation systems. GAO reviewed program and contractor documents, including monthly and quarterly updates from April 2017 through May 2018. GAO also interviewed program and contractor officials. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Commercial Crew Program continues to make progress developing a capability to fly to the International Space Station (ISS), but both contractors have further delayed the certification milestone to early 2019. These changes have occurred as the contractors continue to work to aggressive schedules, and they have had to delay key events regularly. Further delays are likely as the Commercial Crew Program's schedule risk analysis shows that the certification milestone is likely to further slip. In addition, as of mid-June 2018, NASA officials told GAO that these dates may change soon but that both contractors have not yet provided official updates to their schedules to NASA. NASA has not fully shared information with Congress regarding the risks of future schedule delays for the contractors and, as a result, Congress lacks insight into when the contractors will be certified. Also, there may be a gap in access to the ISS if the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays. While NASA has begun to discuss potential options, it currently does not have a contingency plan for how to ensure an uninterrupted presence on the ISS beyond 2019. The Commercial Crew Program relies on several contractual mechanisms to assess safety throughout the certification process, and those mechanisms are in varying stages of completion. The program itself, its contractors, and two of NASA's independent review organizations have raised concerns about the program's ability to assess and evaluate all of the deliverables in a timely manner. In addition, one of the key safety requirements levied by the program is loss of crew, which captures the probability of death or disability to a crew member. NASA does not have a consistent approach for how to incorporate key inputs to assess this metric, which means the agency as a whole may not clearly capture or document its risk tolerance with respect to loss of crew. Further, the program's chief safety and mission assurance officer is dual hatted to serve simultaneously in a programmatic position as well as the program's safety technical authority. This approach creates an environment of competing interests because it relies on the same individual to manage technical and safety aspects on behalf of the program while also serving as the independent oversight of those same areas. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NASA (1) include the results of its schedule risk analysis in its mandatory quarterly reports to Congress and (2) develop and maintain a contingency plan to ensure a presence on the ISS beyond 2018. NASA concurred with three of GAO's recommendations, did not concur with one, and partially concurred with another.",
    "gao_GAO-18-504T": "Why GAO Did This Study SNAP is a federally funded program that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. SNAP recipients are subject to various work requirements, including registering for work, reporting to an employer, and participating in a SNAP employment and training (E&T) program or a workfare program. FNS is responsible for authorizing and overseeing retailers who participate in SNAP, including investigating potential retailer trafficking. This statement discusses (1) the characteristics of SNAP recipients and work registrants participating in SNAP E&T programs, (2) the extent to which FNS has taken steps to address SNAP program integrity issues, and (3) the extent to which FNS has taken steps to prevent, detect, and respond to retailer trafficking. This statement is based on GAO's 2014 report on SNAP recipient fraud and retailer trafficking, as well as ongoing work on FNS's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to retailer trafficking. GAO reviewed FNS data on SNAP recipients and work registrants, interviewed FNS officials, and analyzed FNS data on SNAP E&T participants and outcomes from states. What GAO Found A small percentage of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients participate in SNAP E&T programs, which have experienced changes in characteristics and FNS oversight. According to FNS data, about 14 percent of SNAP recipients, or about 6.1 million, were work registrants who were subject to work requirements, and about 0.5 percent of SNAP recipients, or about 200,000, participated in state SNAP E&T programs, in an average month of fiscal year 2016. FNS officials told GAO that the state data reported to FNS on SNAP E&T participants are the best and most recent data available on this group, yet they also have limitations, which GAO will continue to explore in its ongoing work. SNAP E&T programs have changed in several ways over the last decade. For example, states have increasingly moved from mandatory to voluntary programs, focused on serving ABAWDs, and partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services. FNS has taken steps to increase federal support of states' SNAP E&T programs by increasing the number of federal staff responsible for SNAP E&T and providing additional technical assistance to states. FNS has also taken steps to address challenges in these areas, but concerns remain. For example, regarding SNAP recipient and retailer fraud, FNS has taken some steps to address challenges identified in GAO's 2006 and 2014 reports related to fraud committed by SNAP recipients and authorized retailers, but more remains to be done. For example, FNS has taken some steps to address challenges identified in GAO's 2006 and 2014 reports related to fraud committed by SNAP recipients and authorized retailers, but more remains to be done. For example, FNS has taken some steps to prevent, detect, and respond to retailers who traffic SNAP benefits since GAO's 2006 report on the issue in 2006, but trafficking continues to be a problem. For example, in February 2018, a federal jury convicted a grocery store operator in Baltimore on charges of wire fraud in connection with a scheme to traffic more than $1.6 million in SNAP benefits for food sales that never occurred. The grocery store operator paid cash for SNAP benefits, typically paying the recipient half the value of the benefits and keeping the other half for himself. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement.",
    "gao_GAO-18-128": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2014, the President announced ERI to enhance U.S. posture in Europe. In 2014, the President announced that ERI would provide short-term reassurance to allies and partners, and the initiative had little funding for long-term enhancements to posture. In 2014, the President announced that ERI would be funded through the Office of the U.S. European Command (EUCOM), which is responsible for evaluating the adequacy of posture in Europe. GAO was asked to review ERI. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has expanded ERI's objectives and funding, and (2) the extent to which DOD prioritizes ERI's posture initiatives against those in its base budget, estimates sustainment costs, or communicates future costs to Congress. GAO reviewed ERI's objectives, funding, and plans and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found Since 2014, DOD has expanded the European Reassurance Initiative's (ERI) objectives and increased its funding, contributing to enhancements in its posture in Europe. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, ERI's objective was to provide short-term reassurance to allies, and the initiative had little funding for long-term enhancements to posture. DOD focused its efforts on bolstering the security and capacity of NATO allies and partners by funding training, conducting exercises, and temporarily rotating Army and Air Force units to Eastern Europe. In fiscal year 2017, DOD expanded ERI's objectives to include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. Recognizing that ERI's expanded objectives would require DOD to alter its posture in Europe, DOD has requested increased ERI funding. DOD will have requested approximately $4.5 billion in ERI funding for posture enhancements through the end of fiscal year 2017; about $3.2 billion of this was requested for use in fiscal years 2017. During the time of GAO's review, EUCOM had identified a need for additional funding over the next several years for additional posture enhancements in Europe. Specific details about EUCOM's future posture plans and funding requirements were omitted because they are classified. DOD is using a separate process instead of its established posture planning process to plan for ERI's posture initiatives because of the emergent nature of ERI requirements and their having been funded through the Office of the Secretary of Defense's (DOD) Office of Contingency Operations (OCO) budget. DOD has established global defense posture management and base budget development processes that plan for posture initiatives and collectively support the department's efforts to establish priorities, evaluate resource requirements, and develop strategy and policy. As a result of its not using its established processes, DOD is not prioritizing posture initiatives funded under ERI against posture initiatives funded through its base budget, estimating sustainment costs, or communicating future ERI costs to Congress.

As a result of its not using its established processes, DOD is not prioritizing posture initiatives funded under ERI against posture initiatives funded through its base budget, estimating sustainment costs, or communicating future ERI costs to Congress. DOD's planning for ERI's posture initiatives does not establish priorities for ERI initiatives relative to those in the base budget, estimate long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, or communicate future ERI costs to Congress. DOD leadership emphasized throughout the fiscal year 2018 budget review process that the services would need to fund ERI posture sustainment costs through their respective base budgets, but DOD did not direct the services and EUCOM to estimate these costs as they would have under their established processes. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation said that DOD leadership emphasized that the military services would need to fund all future sustainment costs for ERI projects from their base budgets. Based on DOD's approach for calculating rough order sustainment costs, GAO determined that ERI sustainment costs for prepositioned equipment and construction could be substantial. Army and Air Force officials said that they were working to identify and incorporate these costs into future base budget submissions. DOD officials said that they were correctly applying DOD's approach for estimating sustainment costs, but noted that actual costs may be lower than the estimated costs, because the military services may not fully fund sustainment.",
    "gao_GAO-18-422": "Why GAO Did This Study The Army's investigation into the May 2015 incident at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, found that the biosafety and biosecurity of BSAT materials had been compromised. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the Army's 2015 investigation report. This report discusses the extent to which (1) DOD has implemented the recommendations from the Army's 2015 investigation report and has developed an approach to measure the effectiveness of actions taken to address the recommendations, (2) the Army has implemented the BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program and developed a strategy and implementation plan, (3) the Army has developed measures to ensure that its biological test and evaluation mission remains independent, and (4) DOD has carried out a study and evaluation in compliance with the requirements contained in section 218, subsection (d), of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. GAO reviewed DOD's 2015 investigation report and interviewed DOD and military service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented 18 of 35 recommendations from the Army's December 2015 investigation report regarding the inadvertent shipment of incompletely inactivated Bacillus anthracis from Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. DOD reported that it has actions under way to implement the remaining 17 recommendations. The Secretary of the Army, as Executive Agent for DOD's BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program, is responsible for implementing the recommendations from the 2015 investigation report. DOD has established processes to track the status of actions that it has taken and monitor time lines for completion by responsible DOD organizations. This helps BBPO understand what actions have been taken and where they fit into a larger plan to improve biosafety at specific facilities and organizations and across the DOD BSAT enterprise. However, BBPO has not developed an approach to assess the effectiveness of each implemented recommendation in achieving its intended purpose. According to DOD officials, BBPO has been focused on implementing not only the recommendations from the 2015 Army investigation report but also its broader efforts for the DOD BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program and has not yet formalized an approach to evaluating the effectiveness of actions taken to address the recommendations from the 2015 Army investigation report. Measuring the effectiveness of each implemented recommendation would help BBPO to better determine whether the actions taken are working, whether there are unintended consequences, or if further action is necessary. The Army has implemented a BSAT Biosafety and Biosecurity Program but does not have a complete strategy and implementation plan to assist the program in the long term. The Army has not fully institutionalized measures to ensure that its biological test and evaluation mission remains independent from its biological research and development mission at the Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center. This is important for preventing undue influence of test and evaluation procedures on research and development procedures, and vice versa. The Army has not fully institutionalized measures to ensure that its biological test and evaluation mission remains independent from its biological research and development mission at the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center. This is important for preventing undue influence of test and evaluation procedures on research and development procedures, and vice versa.

DOD was to report to the congressional defense committees by February 1, 2017, among other things, on the results of its study to evaluate (1) the feasibility of consolidating covered facilities within a unified command to minimize risk, (2) opportunities to partner with industry for the production of BSAT and related services in lieu of maintaining such capabilities within the Army, and (3) whether operations under the BSAT production program should be transferred to another government or commercial laboratory that might be better suited to produce BSAT for non-DOD customers. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides specific guidance to federal agencies on how to communicate clearly defined objectives that are to be achieved\u2014including time frames for completing those objectives\u2014and to inform decision makers in a timely manner. DOD provided a report to the congressional defense committees on April 10, 2017, stating that the department is still identifying its BSAT infrastructure requirements. However, as of March 2018, CBDP officials acknowledged that these study efforts are ongoing and that there are no estimated time frames for completing any of them. DOD officials stated that they are focusing on identifying enterprise-wide infrastructure for CBDP, of which BSAT infrastructure is just one part. Officials stated that they have prioritized their efforts to first address the recommendations from the 2015 investigation report, which included calling for DOD to designate an entity to take responsibility for CBDP Enterprise infrastructure. CBDP officials stated that when they established the infrastructure manager position, they decided to study CBD",
    "gao_GAO-18-49": "Why GAO Did This Study The number of postsecondary instructional faculty has grown significantly over the past 20 years. Contingent faculty\u2014those who teach at multiple institutions and who do not have tenure\u2014increased from 57.6 in 1995 to 71.6 percent in 2011. GAO was asked to review the makeup, utilization, and economic circumstances of the instructional workforce. This report examines (1) what is known about the makeup and utilization of the instructional workforce; (2) the roles different types of faculty fill at selected institutions and the factors administrators consider when determining their faculty makeup; (3) what is known about how economic circumstances compare across different faculty types; and (4) what contingent faculty members report as advantages and disadvantages of their work. GAO analyzed data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the Integrated Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) on instructional faculty, and interviewed officials from federal, state, and non-governmental agencies. GAO also visited three states selected based on geographic location and size. GAO interviewed administrators and contingent faculty members at 10 institutions in three states\u2014Georgia, North Dakota, and Ohio. What GAO Found From 1995 to 2011, the percentage of postsecondary instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6 to 71.6 percent. During this period the number of positions held by full-time and part-time non-tenure-track faculty\u2014which GAO defines as contingent\u2014both doubled, while the number of positions held by full-time tenure-track faculty grew by about 10 percent. Contingent faculty fill most instructional positions nationwide, though these numbers cannot be compared to historical data. According to 2015 IPEDS data, contingent faculty fill 69.5 percent of the 1,444,774 postsecondary instructional positions across all institutions nationwide, including about 61.4 percent of instructional positions at 4-year institutions, 83.5 percent at 2-year institutions, and 99.7 percent at for-profit institutions. Contingent faculty fill more than half of instructional positions at 2- or 4-year public institutions in the three selected states. Contingent faculty have a range of responsibilities, and they consider multiple needs when determining faculty makeup. For example, administrators said they consider financial, institutional, faculty, and student needs when determining faculty makeup. For example, administrators said they offer part-time contingent faculty positions, in part because many qualified candidates want to work part-time for professional, family, or other reasons. In addition, some full-time contingent faculty serve as instructors or lecturers whose sole responsibility is to teach.

    "gao_GAO-18-46": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for ensuring that individuals that transport hazardous materials or have unescorted access to secure areas of transportation facilities at maritime ports and TSA-regulated airports do not pose a security threat. TSA's TIM program is to replace its legacy systems that support the maritime and surface transportation segments. GAO was asked to review the TIM program. This report examines (1) the status of the TIM program's implementation, (2) the extent to which the program has implemented leading practices for software development, and (3) the extent to which TSA and DHS have implemented leading practices for program oversight. GAO reviewed program documentation and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TIM) program experienced significant cost, schedule, and performance issues during its initial implementation efforts. Specifically, in May 2014, TSA launched an initial version of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system for the maritime transportation segment of TIM that was to support the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. However, as GAO previously reported, in September 2014, TSA reported to DHS that the program had breached its baseline because it had significant cost, schedule, and performance issues due to, among other things, the addition of newly created credentialing programs that were added to the program's scope, such as TSA Pre\u00ae and Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. TIM program officials have taken action to better account for the TIM program's future data migration efforts. Specifically, as part of the new strategy, the officials plan to defer legacy data migration until after system deployment efforts are complete to avoid disrupting deployment efforts. However, the remaining three challenges regarding constraints with COTS product, significant addition of new transportation programs (e.g., TSA Pre\u00ae), and insufficient stakeholder coordination and communication have not been fully addressed. Until the program establishes and implements specific time frames for determining key implementation details, including how it will transition the program from its current state to an interim state and to the final state, the TIM program office, and TSA and DHS oversight bodies cannot be certain about how the program will ultimately deliver its complete open source solution. The TIM program has fully implemented the first two of the leading practices necessary to ensure the successful adoption of Agile software development, but the remaining four practices have not been fully implemented. The gaps GAO has identified with the program's implementation of Agile are concerning given that it did not follow key IT acquisition best practices when using its waterfall development approach during the program's first 8 years and spent over $280 million on a system that TSA has determined it needs to replace. Specifically, the program has not fully implemented the following practices: (1) Establishing a clear product vision, (2) Prioritizing requirements for the TIM system, (3) Using automated tools to enable rapid system development and deployment, (4) Having a process for identifying corrective actions, (5) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (6) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (7) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (7) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (7) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (7) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (7) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8) Developing a process for identifying corrective actions, (8)",
    "gao_GAO-18-180": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing all modes of transportation, including freight and passenger rail, and passenger rail/mass transit. TSA has employed surface inspectors for a variety of activities intended to mitigate risks to surface transportation and enhance the security of the United States' surface transportation systems and networks. GAO was asked to review TSA's surface transportation security efforts. This report examines (1) how TSA surface inspectors implement the agency's surface transportation security mission, and (2) the extent to which TSA has used a risk-based approach to prioritize and implement surface inspector activities. GAO analyzed TSA data on surface inspector activities from fiscal years 2013 to 2017, reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has employed surface inspectors for a variety of activities to implement its surface transportation security mission, including (1) regulatory inspections for freight and passenger rail systems, (2) regulatory TWIC inspections, and (3) non-regulatory security assessments and training which surface transportation entities participate in on a voluntary basis. Surface inspectors conduct a variety of activities to implement TSA's surface transportation security mission, including (1) regulatory inspections for freight and passenger rail systems, (2) regulatory TWIC inspections, and (3) non-regulatory security assessments and training which surface transportation entities participate in on a voluntary basis. TSA has taken steps to expand its use to more surface modes and address implementation challenges. For example, TSA has made adjustments to the Baseline Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) program to expand its use to more surface modes and address implementation challenges. TSA officials told GAO that they are unable to identify the total time surface inspectors spend on aviation activities because of data limitations. For example, TSA cannot reliably identify the time surface inspectors enter into the aviation module of the Performance and Results Information System (PARIS), including time spent on aviation activities. As a result, TSA does not have complete information on how surface inspector resources are being used or the extent to which surface inspectors are being used to perform aviation activities. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that agencies should use complete information to make informed decisions and evaluate the agency's performance in achieving key objectives. Without having access to complete information on all inspector activities, including aviation activities, TSA cannot monitor how frequently surface inspectors are being used to support aviation. In addition, by not using complete information on how much time surface inspectors spend working in support of aviation, TSA is limited in its ability to make informed future decisions on annual resource needs for surface inspectors, which will be especially important as TSA takes steps to expand its inspection activities with the promulgation of new surface security regulations. By addressing the limitations in the aviation module of PARIS, TSA would be able to more reliably access complete information on all inspector activities. Also, it would have the information it needs to make fully informed decisions about surface inspector resources and activities, and to evaluate surface inspectors' performance in achieving key surface security objectives. TSA surface inspectors perform a wide range of regulatory and non-regulatory activities to fulfill the agency's objective of employing risk-based security, but GAO found that between fiscal years 2013 and 2017 surface inspector activities did not align with the risks TSA identified for surface transportation. To inform its security strategy, TSA assesses risk within and across the aviation, freight rail, passenger rail/mass transit, highway, and pipeline modes approximately every 2 years using the Transportation Security Sector Risk Assessments (TSSRA). According to the TSSRA's cross-modal risk assessments between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, one particular surface mode consistently posed the highest risk, and another consistently posed the lowest risk out of all surface transportation modes. However, GAO found that TSA did not use the results of risk assessments that measure threat, vulnerability, and consequence, like the TSSRA, when it developed surface inspector work plans, or when it monitored activities inspectors conducted, including those in addition to the minimum work plan requirements. TSA officials told GAO that they considered the results of the TSSRA, but TSA officials could not provide evidence that they incorporated the results of the TSSRA or other risk assessments when developing the work plan and monitoring inspector activities, as required by DHS risk management guidance. By incorporating the results of its risk assessments when it plans and monitors surface inspector activities, including those not required by the work plan, TSA would be better able to ensure that its limited surface transportation security resources are being used to effectively and efficiently address the highest risks to surface transportation, especially as risks evolve. By incorporating the results of its risk assessments when it plans and monitors surface inspector activities, including those not required by the work plan, TSA would be better able to ensure that",
    "gao_GAO-18-475": "Why GAO Did This Study The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) was enacted in July 2015 to increase employment opportunities for youth. WIOA requires states and local areas to spend at least 75 percent of their youth grant funds on out-of-school youth and 20 percent of their youth grant funds on work experiences. GAO was asked to review WIOA implementation. This report examines (1) what is known about states' and local areas' progress in meeting WIOA spending requirements for serving out-of-school youth and providing youth with work experiences; (2) how local areas are addressing WIOA's emphasis on serving out-of-school youth, and any challenges they have encountered; and (3) how local areas are addressing WIOA's emphasis on youth work experiences and any challenges they have encountered. GAO analyzed DOL data on state spending and DOL guidance and technical assistance, surveyed a nationally representative sample of local workforce areas, and interviewed DOL officials and state workforce board staff and service providers in three states selected based on the proportion of disconnected youth at or above the median for all states. What GAO Found Available data from the Department of Labor (DOL) show a growing number of states are on target to spend at least 75 percent of their youth grant funds on out-of-school youth. Nationally, as of September 30, 2017, states reported spending over 99 percent of their WIOA youth grant program funds allotted in PY2015, and 36 states had spent 75 percent or more of their expended funds on out-of-school youth (with an additional 13 states having spent between 70 and 75 percent). Twenty-nine states reported having spent all of their PY2015 funds, and of these states, 21 had spent 75 percent or more on out-of-school youth. The remaining 8 fell short of the level generally required by statute. However, for PY2015 specifically, DOL allowed states that could not meet the 75 percent requirement to spend a minimum of 50 percent of funds on out-of-school youth (rather than 75 percent) if they spent at least 10 percentage points more on these youth than in the previous program year. Applying this standard to DOL data, all but two states were on track to meet the modified requirement for PY2015 funds. Most local workforce areas GAO surveyed reported that they were on track to meet the requirement that they spend 75 percent of their WIOA youth grant funds on out-of-school youth. They also reported they were making progress on the requirement that they spend 20 percent of their funds providing work experience to all youth served by WIOA (in- and out-of-school). With respect to the out-of-school youth spending requirement, approximately 76 percent of survey respondents reported spending at or above the required level, and 3 percent reported spending below it. The majority of local workforce areas reported that it was not challenging or only slightly challenging to meet WIOA's spending requirements for serving out-of-school youth and the provision of work experiences. However, an estimated 15 percent reported that meeting the out-of-school youth requirement was very or extremely challenging, and around 21 percent reported the same about the work experience requirement. To address challenges in shifting spending to out-of-school youth, local workforce area staff and service providers said they have increased their recruiting efforts, developed new partnerships, strengthened existing partnerships, and expanded services. To mitigate challenges in shifting spending to out-of-school youth, local workforce area staff and service providers said they have increased their recruiting efforts, developed new partnerships, strengthened existing partnerships, and expanded services. Many local workforce areas GAO surveyed have increased their emphasis on work experiences for youth under WIOA, with paid employment being the most common type of opportunity provided to youth. While work experience was a youth program element under WIA, since the enactment of WIOA, an estimated 82 percent of local workforce areas reported they had expanded work experience opportunities, and 59 percent of local workforce areas reported they provided work experiences to a greater percentage of youth participants than in the years prior to WIOA. In addition, an estimated 81 percent of local workforce areas reported that to a great or very great extent they relied on paying a youth participant's salary to meet the requirement. However, an estimated 88 percent of local workforce areas reported that to a great or very great extent they paid a youth's entire salary to meet the requirement.

    "gao_GAO-19-207": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for addressing the human health and environmental risks presented by this contamination in the most cost-effective way. However, most of EM's largest projects are significantly delayed and over budget, and state regulators for nearly all of EM's cleanup sites have responded by initiating enforcement actions, often leading to additional agreements, including administrative orders and court settlements, in addition to initial federal facility agreements to ensure those risks are addressed. EM relies on milestones, among other metrics, to measure the overall performance of its operations activities, and EM reports that very few of its milestones over the past 2 decades have been missed. GAO was asked to review the status of milestones. This report examines (1) the number of milestones in place at EM's 16 cleanup sites, (2) the extent to which milestones are tracked and reported to EM headquarters and the selected sites, and (3) the extent to which milestones are tracked and reported to EM headquarters and the selected sites. GAO reviewed milestone data and interviewed EM headquarters and site officials at four sites selected based on the number of milestones and the number of milestones completed. What GAO Found At the 16 DOE cleanup sites, cleanup is governed by 72 agreements and hundreds of milestones. These agreements include federal facility agreements generally negotiated between DOE, the state, and EPA, and compliance orders from state regulators. These agreements may impose penalties for missing milestones and may amend or modify earlier agreements, including extending or eliminating milestone dates. Within the agreements, hundreds of milestones outline deadlines for specific actions to be taken by EM as it carries out its cleanup work. However, because EM lacks a standard definition of milestones, some sites track milestones differently than EM headquarters, limiting EM's ability to monitor performance. EM relies on milestones, among other metrics, to measure the overall performance of its operations activities, and EM reports that very few of its milestones over the past 2 decades have been missed. However, EM's self-reported performance in achieving milestones does not provide an accurate view of actual progress in cleaning up sites. EM has not established clear definitions for tracking and reporting milestones and does not have any requirements governing the way sites are to update milestone information. As a result, EM's internal tracking of these milestones has inconsistencies. Additionally, since the requirement to annually report on the status of milestones was set in 2011, EM has produced only two reports to Congress, and these were inaccurate and incomplete. Without a clear and consistent approach to collecting and reporting this data, including the history of milestone changes, EM cannot accurately use milestones for managing and measuring the performance of its cleanup program. The absence of reliable and complete information on the progress of EM's cleanup mission limits EM's and Congress's ability to manage its mission and complicates Congress's ability to oversee the cleanup work. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EM update its policies and procedures to establish a standard definition of milestones and specify requirements for both including and updating milestone information. EM agreed with three of GAO's recommendations and partially agreed with one.",
    "gao_GAO-19-196": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2017 data breach of Equifax highlighted the risks associated with the collection, use, and protection of consumer information. CRAs are companies that assemble or evaluate consumer information for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties. CRAs may be considered financial institutions under GLBA if they collect, maintain, and report on consumer information. GAO was asked to review the Equifax data breach. This report examines (1) the federal laws and regulations governing consumer reporting agencies' collection, use, and protection of consumer information; (2) measures the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken to enforce CRA compliance with requirements to protect consumer information; (3) measures the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken to ensure that CRAs protect consumer information; and (4) FTC's and CFPB's roles in assisting consumers following a data breach and actions consumers can take following a data breach of a CRA. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, analyzed agency documents, and interviewed agency staff and representatives of CRAs, consumer groups, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs the accuracy, use, and sharing of consumer information. It governs the accuracy of this information and gives consumers rights to view, correct, or opt out of the sharing or use of certain aspects of their personal information among affiliates. CRAs also take steps to validate the legitimacy of users and their requests for consumer report information and apply FCRA requirements to the sharing of information within their companies. FTC has taken significant enforcement actions against CRAs that have violated federal privacy or data security laws, but lacks civil penalty authority for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) data protection provisions. FTC has taken a total of 66 actions against companies that allegedly engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to data protection. FTC staff said that in determining whether to take on a case related to privacy and data security matters, they consider factors such as the company's size and the sensitivity of the data in the company's network. FTC may seek a range of remedies from the U.S. district courts, including injunctions, damages to compensate consumers for their actual losses, and disgorgement of ill-gotten funds. In limited circumstances, FTC also may seek civil money penalties, which are monetary fines imposed for a violation of a statute or regulation. CFPB has the authority to examine CRAs for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws, but does not routinely consider data security risks in its process for prioritizing examinations. CFPB staff said that they do not routinely consider data security risks during their examination prioritization process and have not reassessed the process to determine how to incorporate such risks going forward. By including routine consideration of data security risks into its process for prioritizing CRA examinations, CFPB can better ensure that its supervision of CRAs proactively detects such risks and helps prevent the further exposure or compromise of consumer information. FTC and CFPB provide consumers with information on ways to mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, FTC has a dedicated website that allows consumers to report suspected identity theft to FTC and develop and implement a recovery plan. Similarly, CFPB publishes a consumer guide that lists CRAs and their websites, and ways to obtain free credit reports. After a breach, FTC and CFPB publish information specific to that breach. For example, shortly after Equifax's announcement of the breach, FTC published information on when the breach occurred, the types of data compromised, and links to additional information on Equifax's website. Similarly, CFPB released three blog posts and several social media posts shortly after Equifax's public announcement of the breach. These included information on ways that consumers could protect themselves in the wake of the breach and special protections and actions for service members. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CFPB identify additional sources of information, such as through registering CRAs or leveraging state information, that would help ensure that it is tracking all CRAs that meet the larger market participant threshold. CFPB neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-190": "Why GAO Did This Study The Air Force is responsible for gaining and maintaining air superiority in contested environments. The F-22 is the Air Force's fifth generation fighter, which incorporates a stealthy and highly maneuverable airframe, advanced integrated avionics, and engines capable of sustained supersonic flight. The Air Force has not reviewed the F-22 since 2010. GAO was asked to review the F-22. This report examines (1) the extent to which the F-22 has been reviewed by the Air Force since 2010, and (2) the extent to which the Air Force's utilization of F-22s has affected the training of F-22 pilots. GAO reviewed the F-22's maintenance and supply issues, and interviewed Air Force officials. GAO also reviewed the Air Force's plans to retain the F-22 until 2060. What GAO Found The size and structure of the Air Force's F-22 fleet diminishes the Air Force's ability to maximize the number of F-22s available for operations and have not been reviewed since 2010. The F-22 has sustainment issues due to the fleet's maintenance and supply challenges. These challenges have affected aircraft availability rates, which have remained below Air Force standards. The small size of F-22 squadrons and wings has contributed to low aircraft availability rates. Further, the Air Force practice of deploying a small portion of a squadron makes it difficult for F-22 squadrons, as currently organized, to make aircraft available for their missions at home station. The Air Force would also face difficulties generating aircraft to support the Department of Defense's (DOD) concepts for using distributed operations in high threat environments with its current F-22 squadron organization. Although in 2016 it assessed its future air superiority capability needs, the Air Force has not comprehensively assessed whether the current F-22 organizational structure is optimal to support combatant commander needs. Without conducting a comprehensive assessment of the F-22 organizational structure that identifies and assesses alternative approaches to organizing F-22 squadrons, the Air Force may be forgoing opportunities to improve the availability of its small yet critical F-22 fleet to support current and future combatant commander high-end air superiority needs. The Air Force's utilization of its F-22 fleet has limited its pilots' opportunities to train for their high-end air superiority missions, and contributed to F-22 pilots not meeting their training requirements. F-22 pilots need extensive training in order to be prepared to execute their high-end air superiority missions. However, Air Force utilization of F-22 units for exercises, the low supply of adversary air training capabilities, and the use of F-22s to meet combatant commander needs, including the alert mission, affects the ability of pilots to meet those requirements. The Air Force is providing F-22s in support of current combatant commander needs, including alert missions and operational deployments, but the alert mission and these operational deployments take time away from air superiority training. Although these missions are important, they take no or limited advantage of the F-22's unique capabilities. Operational deployments also reduce the time available for F-22 pilots to conduct home station training for their high-end air superiority missions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Air Force conduct a comprehensive assessment of the F-22 organizational structure that identifies and assesses alternative approaches to organizing F-22 squadrons. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-457": "Why GAO Did This Study The DRC is a vast, mineral-rich nation with an estimated population of about 83 million people and an area that is roughly one-quarter the size of the United States. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires the SEC to promulgate disclosure and reporting regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals originating from the DRC and covered countries. The act also requires GAO to report annually on the SEC's disclosure process. This report examines (1) companies' disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO reviewed a generalizable sample of company disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 and interviewed SEC, State, and U.S. Agency for International Development officials. What GAO Found GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, a similar number of companies filed conflict minerals disclosures as in 2015 and 2016. GAO's review of a generalizable sample of filings found that an estimated 90 percent of the companies that filed in 2017 were domestic and an estimated 10 percent were foreign companies, similar to the domestic-to-foreign ratio GAO found in 2016 and 2015. In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated challenges in determining the country of origin. GAO's review of company filings found that almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquires, reported performing it. SEC issued revised guidance in April 2017, indicating that the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance would not recommend enforcement action if companies did not report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements. GAO identified two new population-based surveys since its last report related to sexual violence in Burundi and Uganda published in 2018; the most recent information for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016. GAO also identified some new case-file data on sexual violence in the DRC; however, as GAO reported previously, case-file data on sexual violence are not suitable for estimating an overall rate of sexual violence. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. SEC provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. State and USAID did not provide comments.",
    "gao_GAO-18-696T": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 directed the departments to jointly develop and implement fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities by the September 30, 2009, deadline. The act also called for the departments to set up the Interagency Program Office to be a single point of accountability for their efforts to implement these systems or capabilities by the September 30, 2009, deadline. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which the Interagency Program Office has functioned as the single point of accountability for the departments' efforts to increase electronic health record interoperability and modernize their respective electronic health record systems, and (2) the actions the Interagency Program Office has taken to improve interoperability measurement and additional actions are planned. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports on the Interagency Program Office and the departments' efforts to modernize their respective electronic health record systems. What GAO Found The Interagency Program Office has been involved in the various approaches taken by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) to increase electronic health record interoperability and modernize their respective electronic health record systems. These approaches have included development of the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) and a new, common integrated electronic health record (iEHR) system. However, although the office has led efforts to identify data standards that are critical to interoperability between systems, the office has not been effectively positioned to be the single point of accountability as called for in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Moreover, the future role of the office with respect to VA's current electronic health record modernization program is uncertain. In July 2008, GAO reported that VA and DOD had taken steps to set up the Interagency Program Office, but the office was not positioned to be the single point of accountability for the departments' efforts to achieve electronic health record interoperability by September 30, 2009. GAO recommended that the departments give priority to fully establishing the office by putting in place permanent leadership and staff, as well as finalizing the draft implementation plan. Both departments agreed with this recommendation. In February 2011, GAO reported that the Interagency Program Office had not yet developed complete plans for the VLER initiative. In February 2014, GAO reported that the departments' decision to abandon their plans for iEHR was not consistent with effective collaboration. GAO recommended that the departments strengthen their efforts to establish VLER by developing plans that would include scope definition, cost and schedule estimation, and project plan documentation and approval. Although the departments stated they agreed with this recommendation, they did not implement it. In February 2014, GAO reported that the departments' decision to abandon their plans for iEHR was not consistent with effective collaboration. GAO recommended that the departments strengthen their efforts to establish VLER by developing plans that would include scope definition, cost and schedule estimation, and project plan documentation and approval. Although the departments stated they agreed with this recommendation, they did not implement it. In August 2015, GAO reported that VA and DOD, with guidance from the Interagency Program Office, had taken actions to increase interoperability between their electronic health record systems. Among other things, the departments had initiated work focused on near-term objectives, including standardizing their existing health data and making them viewable by both departments' clinicians in an integrated format. The departments also developed longer-term plans to modernize their respective electronic health record systems. For its part, the Interagency Program Office issued guidance outlining the technical approach for achieving interoperability between the departments' systems. However, even with the actions taken, VA and DOD did not certify by the October 1, 2014, deadline established in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 for compliance with national data standards that all health care data in their systems complied with national standards and were computable in real time. GAO also reported that the departments' system modernization plans identified a number of key activities to be implemented beyond December 31, 2016\u2014the deadline established in the act for the two departments to deploy modernized electronic health record software to support clinicians while ensuring full standards-based interoperability by December 31, 2016. In June 2017, the former VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department's approach to modernizing the department's electronic health record system. Specifically, rather than continue to use VistA, the Secretary stated that the department planned to acquire the same Cerner electronic health record system that DOD has been acquiring. Accordingly, the department awarded a contract to Cerner in May 2018 for a maximum of $10 billion over 10 years. Deployment of the new electronic health record system at three initial sites is planned for within 18 months of October 1, 2018, with a phased implementation of the remaining sites over the next decade.",
    "gao_GAO-18-19": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S. workers and retirees in workplace retirement plans are subject to U.S. income tax on their worldwide income. However, U.S. individuals who participate in foreign workplace retirement plans may be subject to tax evasion. GAO was asked to review the tax treatment of U.S. workers and retirees in foreign workplace retirement plans. This report examines (1) challenges participants face managing unclaimed retirement accounts and the extent to which federal agencies provide guidance and information to assist them or plan sponsors, and (2) challenges U.S. workers and retirees in foreign workplace retirement plans face with reporting their foreign retirement accounts. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed federal officials and tax preparers in five case study locations selected based on the number of employees and retirement savings in the United States and the number of foreign workplace retirement plans. What GAO Found Participants in U.S. workplace retirement plans face challenges managing unclaimed accounts accumulated over the course of their careers. GAO previously reported that some 401(k) plan participants find it difficult to keep track of their savings, particularly when they change jobs, because of challenges with consolidation, communication, and information. For example, individuals who accrue multiple accounts over the course of a career may be unable to consolidate their accounts by rolling over savings from one employer's plan to the next. In addition, maintaining communication with a former employer's plan can be challenging if companies are restructured and plans are terminated or merged and renamed. DOL has not provided guidance to ongoing plans on locating missing participants and unclaimed accounts. DOL officials said that they are conducting investigations of steps taken by ongoing plans to find missing participants under their authority to oversee compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). However, DOL has not provided guidance to ongoing plans on their obligations under ERISA to prevent, search for, and pay costs associated with missing participants. IRS has not issued guidance clarifying tax withholding requirements for cash-outs from unclaimed retirement accounts. IRS officials said that the agency does not routinely credit federal tax withholding to a taxpayer's current federal tax liability unless the taxpayer has made a claim. IRS officials said that the agency does not routinely credit federal tax withholding to a taxpayer's current federal tax liability unless the taxpayer has made a claim. IRS officials said that the agency does not routinely credit federal tax withholding to a taxpayer's current federal tax liability unless the taxpayer has made a claim. By reviewing the issue of distributions to participants with unclaimed accounts, including reviewing the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), IRS may be able to issue guidance on applicable tax withholding and other tax requirements with respect to such accounts. Certain information U.S. workers receive on unclaimed workplace retirement accounts based on data reported to IRS by plan sponsors is often outdated and incorrect because plan sponsors are not updating the data over time as required. IRS officials said the data can be inaccurate because plan sponsors are not consistently reporting distributions, resulting in erroneous records of accounts accumulating in the database. IRS officials said the data can be inaccurate because plan sponsors are not consistently reporting distributions, resulting in erroneous records of accounts accumulating in the database. IRS officials said the agency has been considering issuing improved guidance in some areas pertaining to the taxation of foreign retirement accounts. However, without clearer specific guidance from IRS describing how to correctly report foreign retirement assets on a U.S. tax return, U.S. individuals who participate in foreign workplace retirement plans continue to run the risk of filing incorrect returns due to confusion over how to properly classify and report their accounts. IRS officials said that U.S. individuals who participate in foreign workplace retirement plans may incur substantial costs to correctly file their returns and risk diminishing their retirement security if they fail to correctly report their foreign retirement assets. IRS officials said that U.S. individuals who participate in foreign workplace retirement plans may not realize that a routine transfer of their foreign retirement assets within plans or from one plan to another should be reported as a taxable event, resulting in an incorrect filing and/or potential penalties. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOL, IRS, and the Social Security Administration (1) issue guidance on the obligations under ERISA of sponsors of ongoing plans to prevent, search for, and pay costs associated with missing participants; (2) clarify how U.S. individuals are to report their foreign retirement accounts; and (3) consider revising Form 8938 to more clearly distinguish between retirement accounts and other types of accounts or assets being reported by taxpayers under current reporting requirements. DOL, IRS, and the Social Security Administration agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-563T": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA relies on TSOs to screen passengers for threats to aviation security, such as prohibited and other potentially dangerous items. TSA airports are to allocate TSOs to airports using its Resource Allocation Plan, which is intended to provide each airport with the optimum number of TSOs needed to screen passengers for threats to aviation security, such as prohibited and other potentially dangerous items. TSA airport officials are to submit passenger throughput and wait time data on a daily basis to TSA headquarters, which compiles the data through the Performance Measurement Information System, TSA's web-based data collection system. This statement discusses (1) TSA processes for collecting wait time and throughput data at airports, (2) TSA's use of wait time and throughput data to monitor airport operations, and (3) TSA's use of TSOs to respond to increases in passenger wait times and throughput. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report (GAO-2018-02-29) and selected updates from TSA headquarters and airports. GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses passenger wait time and throughput data to monitor daily operations at airports. TSA's Operations Directive (directive) requires TSA to collect wait time and throughput data and uses those data to monitor daily operations at airports. TSA officials at airports GAO visited for its February 2018 report stated that TSA collects wait time and throughput data daily and uses those data to monitor daily operations at airports. TSA officials at airports GAO visited for its February 2018 report stated that TSA monitors airport operations at 28 airports in near real time. In May 2016, TSA established the Airport Operations Center partly in response to the long screening checkpoint lines in the spring of 2016 at certain airports. The center conducts near real time monitoring of the operations of 28 airports that, according to TSA headquarters officials, represent the majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally significant. TSA officials at airports GAO visited for its February 2018 report stated that TSA officials at the Airport Operations Center assisted in deploying additional passenger screening canines and TSOs to those airports that experienced longer wait times. For example, over the course of the summer of 2016, after certain airports experienced long wait times in the spring of 2016, the center assisted in deploying additional passenger screening canines and TSOs to those airports that experienced longer wait times. TSA airport officials reported using a variety of tools to respond to increases in passenger wait times and/or throughput. TSA officials at selected airports used passenger screening canines to expedite the screening process and support screening operations during increased passenger throughput and wait time periods. For example, TSA officials at one airport emphasized the importance of passenger screening canines as a useful tool to minimize wait times and meet passenger screening demands at times when throughput is high. Officials at another airport GAO visited relied on these canines in busy terminals during peak periods. TSA officials at two of the airports GAO visited used part-time TSOs and overtime hours to accommodate increases in passenger throughput and wait times. For example, officials at one airport GAO visited emphasized the importance of passenger screening canines as a useful tool to minimize wait times and meet passenger screening demands at times when throughput is high. Officials at another airport GAO visited relied on these canines in busy terminals during peak periods. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement.",
    "gao_GAO-18-620": "Why GAO Did This Study Lead is a toxic element in drinking water. The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to replace lead service lines if the water system is unable to meet the rule's requirements. The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to identify the number of lead service lines and the materials inventory required by the rule. GAO was asked to review the number of lead service lines. This report examines (1) what is known about the number of existing lead service lines nationally, and among states and water systems; and (2) state responses to EPA's request to work with water systems to publicize inventories of lead service lines and any steps EPA has taken to follow up on these responses. GAO reviewed EPA documents and interviewed EPA officials. GAO also reviewed the websites of the 100 largest water systems. What GAO Found The total number of lead service lines is unknown and while national, state, and local estimates exist, approaches used to count lead service lines vary. The total number of lead service lines is unknown because, among other things, the Lead and Copper Rule does not require all water systems to collect such information. National, state, and local estimates exist, but the methods used to arrive at these estimates vary, making it challenging to compare estimates. The total number of lead service lines is unknown, in part because the Lead and Copper Rule does not require all water systems to develop and maintain a complete inventory of lead service lines, and there are no national repositories of information about lead service lines. National, state, and local estimates exist, but the approaches used to arrive at these estimates vary, making it challenging to compare estimates. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not implemented a recommendation to collect data about lead pipes (including lead service lines) from states. By doing so, EPA and congressional decision makers would have important information at the national level on what is known about lead infrastructure in the country, thereby facilitating oversight of the Lead and Copper Rule. Most states reported that they intended to fulfill EPA's request to work with water systems to publicize inventories of lead service lines, but potential challenges remain that EPA information sharing could help to address. Most states that said they intended to fulfill EPA's request to encourage water systems to publicize materials inventories reported in subsequent letters to or meetings with EPA that they did so; however, as of May 2018, most large waters systems had not made such information public. EPA officials in the regional offices provided a range of reasons why water systems may be challenged in conducting inventories of lead service lines and making any information about lead service lines public, but has not followed up with all states about how to address such challenges since 2016. In September 2017, GAO reported that the six states that would not fulfill EPA's 2016 request had highlighted challenges in finding historical documentation about lead pipes to create plans for collecting tap water samples or in dedicating staff resources to do so. In January and February 2018, some officials whom GAO interviewed in EPA's 10 regional offices agreed that these would be challenges for states and water systems. The officials also mentioned additional potential challenges in conducting complete inventories of lead service lines or publicizing information about lead service lines. By sharing information with all states about the approaches that some states and water systems are using to successfully identify and publicize information about lead service lines, including responses to potential challenges, EPA could encourage states to be more transparent to the public and support the agency's objectives for safe drinking water. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EPA share information with all states about the approaches that some states and water systems are using to successfully identify and publicize information about lead service lines, including responses to potential challenges. EPA agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-89": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD maintains a critical infrastructure to support the nation's military forces. Section 2464 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code requires DOD to submit to Congress a biennial report providing information on its core depot-level maintenance and repair capability requirements and workload. Section 2464 also requires GAO to review DOD's biennial core reports. GAO was asked to review DOD's biennial core reports. This report examines the extent to which (1) DOD addressed the elements required by section 2464 and (2) DOD's biennial core report complies with section 2464. GAO analyzed the text of the report and interviewed DOD and military service officials. GAO also reviewed DOD's biennial core reports and interviewed DOD and military service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) addressed eight of the 10 reporting elements required by section 2464 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code. DOD officials stated that the department did not address two of the elements because changes to its guidance and processes for developing the 2018 report resulted in the 2016 and 2018 reports not being directly comparable. DOD officials stated that they plan to address these two elements in the 2020 Biennial Core Report. The military services identified core capability requirements and projected workloads in direct labor hours and associated costs, using the work breakdown structure. The military services each identified projected shortfalls at the first- and second-levels of the work breakdown structure, reasons for those shortfalls, and mitigation plans for the projected shortfalls. DOD did not address the two elements concerning progress made in implementing mitigation plans from the prior core report (element 6), nor did they address the degree to which projected workload reported in the prior core report was executed (element 10). According to Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness (OASD L&MR) officials, they did not address these elements because the elements require DOD to compare information in the 2018 Biennial Core Report with information in the 2016 Biennial Core Report. Since DOD updated its guidance and processes for developing the 2018 Biennial Core Report\u2014in response to new statutory requirements and GAO's prior recommendations\u2014a meaningful comparison was not possible in the 2018 Biennial Core Report, according to OSD and military service officials. Additionally, DOD did not fully provide mitigation plans in its 2016 Biennial Core Report, as GAO reported in 2016. Therefore, DOD was unable to provide progress reports on 2016 mitigation plans. DOD officials told GAO that they plan to use the 2018 Biennial Core Report as a baseline for future biennial core reports, which will allow them to address elements 6 and 10. Specifically, they stated that they plan to provide progress reports on the mitigation plans they identified in the 2018 Biennial Core Report. Additionally, officials stated their intent to provide a comparison of the fiscal year 2019 projected workload reported in the 2018 Biennial Core Report with the actual workload for fiscal year 2019 contained in the 2020 Biennial Core Report. DOD's 2018 Biennial Core Report is generally complete in that it lacks any obvious errors and aligns with supporting information provided by the military services. Specifically, unlike previous biennial core reports, data submissions provided to DOD by the military services are identical to the data in the 2018 Biennial Core Report, and there are no transposition errors. Further, based on GAO's review of the services' submissions to OSD, data and other information provided by the military services were accurately and appropriately included in DOD's 2018 Biennial Core Report. Finally, GAO's analysis of the report and the military services' submissions did not identify errors in the summation of the data. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations at this time. DOD provided technical comments, which GAO included as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-634": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2017, about 2,250 rural hospitals were located in areas that met the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) definition of rural. These hospitals were spread across the 84 percent of the United States land area that FORHP classified as rural, and served the 18 percent of the United States population that lived in these areas. HHS officials identified several rural-specific HHS payment policies and programs as providing key financial support to rural hospitals, and in turn, rural residents' access to hospital services. GAO was asked to review the recent increase in rural hospital closures. This report examines (1) HHS's payment policies and programs that support rural hospitals and (2) the extent to which recent increases in rural hospital closures have occurred in the South. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders, including representatives from the American Hospital Association, the National Rural Health Association, and the North Carolina rural health research center. GAO also reviewed HHS data on rural hospital closures and the financial viability of rural hospitals. GAO also interviewed stakeholders, including representatives from the American Hospital Association, the National Rural Health Association, and the North Carolina rural health research center. What GAO Found HHS officials identified several rural-specific HHS payment policies and programs as providing key financial support to rural hospitals, and in turn, rural residents' access to hospital services. These key HHS payment policies and programs may be placed into three categories: (1) Medicare rural hospital payment designations; (2) rural grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, and (3) new approaches in rural health care delivery and payment. HHS officials identified several rural-specific HHS payment policies and programs as providing key financial support to rural hospitals, and in turn, rural residents' access to hospital services. These key HHS payment policies and programs may be placed into three categories: (1) Medicare rural hospital payment designations; (2) rural grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, and (3) new approaches in rural health care delivery and payment. HHS monitors rural hospitals' financial viability and rural residents' access to hospital services, primarily by funding rural health research centers that track rural hospital closures and study rural residents' access to hospital services. HHS uses the results of its monitoring activities to inform future research and grant awards, and disseminate this information. For example, the North Carolina rural health research center has used the list of rural hospital closures it compiles and its monitoring of profitability to conduct research on predictors of rural hospitals' financial distress. HHS also uses the results of its monitoring activities to update the types of services offered by certain grants and create new cooperative agreements for technical assistance. For example, for fiscal year 2016, for fiscal year 2016, FORHP officials updated the list of activities that Rural Health Network Development Planning grantees can spend funds on to include implementing innovative solutions to alleviate the loss of local services and enhance access to care in communities that have or are at risk of losing their local hospital. HHS uses the results of its monitoring activities to inform future research and grant awards, and disseminate this information. From 2013 through 2017, 64 of the approximately 2400 rural hospitals in the United States closed. These 64 rural hospital closures represented the following: More than twice the number of rural hospitals that closed during the prior 5-year period. From 2008 through 2012, 31 rural hospitals closed. More than the share of urban hospitals that closed. The 64 rural hospital closures from 2013 through 2017\u2014approximately 3 percent of all rural hospitals in 2013\u2014exceeded the 49 urban hospital closures during the same time period\u2014approximately 2 percent of all urban hospitals in 2013. Approximately half of the rural hospitals that closed during this period\u201447 percent\u2014ceased to provide any type of services. The remaining hospitals that closed during this period converted to other facility types, providing more limited or different services, such as urgent care, emergency care, outpatient care, or primary care. According to literature GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed, rural hospital closures were generally preceded and caused by financial distress. In particular, rural hospitals that closed typically had negative margins which made it difficult to cover their fixed costs. For example, one 2016 study found that rural hospitals that closed from 2010 through 2014 had a median operating margin of -7.41 percent in 2009. In contrast, rural hospitals that remained open during the same time period had a median operating margin of 2.00 percent in 2009. In addition, there is evidence that for-profit hospitals have been more sensitive to changes in profitability and more likely to experience financial distress, which could explain the disproportionate number of closures among rural hospitals with for-profit ownership type. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-264": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a large inventory of data centers, which is critical to the nation's information technology (IT) security. In 2010, Congress enacted FITARA, which required agencies to submit a data center inventory and a consolidation plan. FITARA also required OMB to establish a data center optimization initiative. GAO was asked to review agencies' progress in consolidating and optimizing their data centers. This report examines (1) agencies' data center closures to date and plans for further closures, (2) agencies' progress in achieving data center consolidation savings and describe plans for future savings, and (3) agencies' progress against OMB's data center optimization targets. GAO analyzed agency data center inventory documentation from fiscal years 2010 through August 2017 and reviewed agency strategic plans and OMB's data center optimization targets. GAO also interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 24 agencies participating in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) collectively have made progress on their data center closure efforts. Specifically, as of August 2017, the agencies reported that they had closed 5,805 data centers (48 percent). However, the 24 agencies' individual reported progress and plans showed mixed results when compared with OMB's goal for each agency to close at least 25 percent of tiered data centers and at least 60 percent of non-tiered data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018. Specifically, 13 agencies reported that they had already met the goal of closing 25 percent of their tiered data centers, another 4 agencies reported that they plan to meet the goal by the end of fiscal year 2018, and 5 agencies reported that they do not currently plan to meet the goal. Further, 7 agencies reported that they do not plan to meet one of their tiered or non-tiered closure goals, and 4 reported that they do not plan to meet either of the goals by the end of fiscal year 2018. Officials from these 11 agencies that do not plan to meet one or both of their goals provided various reasons for why they currently do not plan to do so. In addition, GAO's analysis determined that it may not always be realistic for an agency to meet OMB's targets. Moreover, GAO's analysis determined that it may not always be realistic for an agency to meet OMB's targets. Given that agencies had been working toward OMB's DCOI goals for approximately one year as of August 2017, and because the extension of FITARA's data center provisions pushes the sunset for these efforts out through fiscal year 2020, GAO is not making any related recommendations to those agencies that have not met the closure goals at this time. GAO plans to continue to monitor the agencies' progress toward meeting the goals in its future work. Agencies continue to report limited progress against OMB's data center optimization targets. As of August 2017, 22 of the 24 agencies continued to report limited progress in meeting OMB's fiscal year 2018 optimization targets. The remaining 2 agencies\u2014Education and the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2014reported that they did not have agency-owned data centers and, therefore, did not have a basis to measure and report optimization progress. In addition, most agencies did not plan to meet OMB's fiscal year 2018 optimization targets by the end of fiscal year 2018. Considering that OMB is expecting at least $2.7 billion in cost savings from agencies' optimization efforts, the ability of agencies to meet the optimization targets will be critical to meeting this savings goal. However, only four agencies are planning to meet all of their applicable targets. If the remaining agencies take steps to implement the prior recommendations GAO has made in this area, it should increase the likelihood that DCOI can achieve the expected benefits of optimization and the resulting cost savings. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this area.",
    "gao_GAO-19-24": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. government has long been concerned about the potential for human health effects from exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide that was used in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. GAO was asked to review the federal government's efforts to clean up the contamination of Agent Orange. This report examines (1) the extent to which the federal government maintains information on the procurement, use, and destruction of Agent Orange, and (2) the extent to which DOD has a process for identifying and communicating the most accurate information to veterans about potential exposure to Agent Orange. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed available DOD and VA documents; and interviewed DOD and VA officials. What GAO Found The federal government maintains information on the procurement, use, and destruction of Agent Orange, and available records indicate that the Department of Defense (DOD) procured approximately 13.9 million gallons of the tactical herbicide, which was either used in U.S. military operations in Southeast Asia, used for testing, or destroyed. GAO's analysis of the available logbooks for 152 of the 158 shipments (approximately 96 percent) of Agent Orange to Southeast Asia that GAO identified indicates that the vessels carrying tactical herbicides generally stopped at foreign ports and sometimes at U.S. ports en route to Southeast Asia. Available primary source materials, such as shipment documentation, are incomplete because they were likely not maintained during and after the Vietnam era. However, based on the available information, GAO identified at least one ship carrying Agent Orange that stopped at Port Apra (now Apra Harbor) on Guam on its way to Vietnam, although GAO could not locate any evidence showing that any cargo was offloaded. Further, while DOD documents identify the use of commercial herbicides on Guam, they do not identify the use of tactical herbicides there. DOD's official compilation of herbicide testing and storage locations outside of Vietnam, which is posted on the VA's website, is inaccurate and incomplete, and veterans have expressed confusion about how to obtain information on potential exposure to Agent Orange. DOD developed a list that identifies locations and dates where herbicides, including Agent Orange, are thought to have been tested and stored outside of Vietnam, which VA has made publicly available on its website, but this list is neither accurate nor complete. Further, while DOD and VA each have methods for communicating information to veterans and the public about Agent Orange, they do not have a formal process for communicating the most accurate available information to veterans about potential locations where they could have been exposed to Agent Orange or other tactical herbicides. Testing to determine whether Agent Orange was present in a particular location is challenging because, for example, derivatives of Agent Orange\u2014including the two components of Agent Orange (n-butyl 2,4-D and n-butyl 2,4,5-T) and the contaminant from the 2,4,5-T manufacturing process (2,3,7,8-TCDD)\u2014degrade over time, and because derivatives of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T can come from multiple sources. Regardless of these challenges, in response to a request by the Government of Guam, DOD developed a testing plan that was reviewed and accepted by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Guam EPA to conduct a limited investigation into alleged Agent Orange use at three sites on Guam. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) assign responsibilities for validating the accuracy of the information included on the list; (2) develop a process for updating the list as needed; and (3) clearly define and transparent criteria for what to include on the list. DOD and VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-636T": "Why GAO Did This Study VA operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the United States, providing health care services to approximately 9 million veterans throughout the United States, Philippines, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. In 2015, GAO designated VA health care as a high-risk area for the federal government, and GAO continues to be concerned about the department's ability to ensure that its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently to improve veterans' timely access to health care. In part, GAO identified limitations in the capacity of VA's existing IT systems, including the outdated, inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system interoperability as contributors to the department's challenges related to health care. In June 2017, the former VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department's approach to modernizing its health information system (VistA). Specifically, rather than continue to use VistA, the Secretary stated that the department planned to acquire the same Cerner electronic health record system that DOD has been acquiring. Accordingly, the department awarded a contract to Cerner in May 2018 for a maximum of $10 billion over 10 years. This statement discusses (1) the costs associated with the new system, (2) VA's efforts to define the scope of the system, (3) VA's efforts to transition from VistA to the Cerner system, and (4) the factors that can serve as a model of best practices that VA could apply to enhance the likelihood that the acquisition of the new system will be successfully achieved. This statement is based on GAO's prior work on VA's health information system and related activities. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has obligated about $3.0 billion to its health information system (VistA) and related activities from fiscal years 2015 through 2017. These obligations are approximated by funding obligations of about $1.1 billion, $899 million, and $946 million in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, for a total of about $3.0 billion over 3 years to support the system. VA is working to define the scope of its current health information system and identify the components that the Cerner electronic health record system will replace. These steps have included conducting two analyses, performing preliminary site assessments, and planning for Cerner to perform a detailed assessment of each site where the new system will be deployed. VA has taken steps to position the department for the transition to the new system. These actions, which are ongoing, have included standardizing VistA, assessing the department's approach to increasing interoperability, establishing governance for the new program and the framework for joint governance with DOD, and preparing initial program plans. GAO's prior work has identified strong agency leadership support and governance as factors that can increase the likelihood of a program's success. Such leadership and governance can come from the establishment of an effective program management organization and a related governance structure. VA has prepared initial program plans, including a preliminary timeline for deploying the new electronic health record system to its medical facilities. The department also has a proposed 90-day schedule that depicts key program activities currently underway now that the contract has been awarded. For example, the department's preliminary plans include an 8-year deployment schedule beginning with planned implementation at initial sites within 18 months of October 1, 2018. According to the executive director for the EHRM program, the department intends to complete a full suite of planning and acquisition management documents to guide the program. These documents include, for example, a life cycle cost estimate, a data migration plan, a change management plan, and an integrated master schedule to establish key milestones over the life of the project.

    "gao_GAO-18-429": "Why GAO Did This Study HUD administers public housing and HCV programs, which provide housing assistance to low-income households. PHAs are required to conduct criminal background checks and terminate housing assistance for certain offenses. HUD's Office of Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for coordinating with law enforcement agencies to identify and apprehend fugitives. GAO was asked to review the Fugitive Felon Initiative. This report examines (1) the statutory and regulatory requirements for PHAs' criminal history policies for public housing and HCV programs; (2) the extent to which HUD provides guidance and monitors PHA implementation of criminal history policy requirements for public housing and HCV programs; and (3) the implementation of the Fugitive Felon Initiative by the HUD OIG, in coordination with the FBI. GAO reviewed federal statutes and HUD regulations for public housing and HCV programs, and interviewed officials from 10 PHAs in four selected metropolitan areas. GAO also reviewed HUD's guidance and compliance procedures in relation to federal requirements for criminal history policies. What GAO Found Federal statutes and HUD regulations require public housing agencies (PHA) to conduct criminal background checks and mandate termination of housing assistance for certain offenses. PHAs must also conduct criminal background checks for applicants to the public housing and HCV programs. PHAs must also obtain sufficient evidence of criminal activity. In November 2015, HUD issued a notice on the use of arrest records and other issues related to denying and terminating housing assistance for individuals who have engaged in criminal activity. The notice stated that the fact that an individual was arrested is not sufficient evidence that the individual engaged in criminal activity and informed PHAs that arrest records could not be used as the basis for denying admissions, terminating assistance, or evicting tenants. In addition, federal statute and HUD regulations require that PHAs include certain offenses that are grounds for denial or termination in their policies, but give PHAs discretion on when and how to act on them. For example, PHAs can, but are not required to, terminate assistance for \"fugitive felons.\" Federal internal control standards state that management should communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. By updating its guidebooks to reflect newer criminal history guidance, HUD can ensure that these guidebooks serve as consolidated and up-to-date references for PHAs that accurately communicate HUD's current guidance on criminal history policies. HUD reviews the criminal history policies for the small number of PHAs it designates as high risk or very-high risk, but these reviews do not address all related federal requirements or their implementation. HUD uses the results to direct field staff towards higher-risk PHAs, such as providing these PHAs with technical assistance or conducting compliance reviews. HUD's Compliance Monitoring Checklist, which was first piloted in 2016 among six PHAs, contains six questions field staff must cover that directly relate to PHAs' criminal history policies. However, the checklist does not include items to assess PHAs' compliance with additional aspects of PHAs' criminal history policies. By reviewing the checklist to determine what additional criminal history policy requirements should be included and revising the checklist instructions to direct staff to obtain information on PHAs' implementation of criminal history policy requirements, HUD could improve its ability to identify areas of noncompliance. The Fugitive Felon Initiative has led to over 1,200 apprehensions of wanted persons in the past 5 years, but its implementation and program oversight have been inconsistent. The HUD OIG has revised its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to define regional office responsibilities, improve consistency among regional offices' participation, and leverage the FBI's efforts. The SOP includes some added requirements for HUD OIG headquarters to track and report some statistics related to its regional offices' activities, but the HUD OIG does not plan to collect or assess data on some activities listed in the 2018 SOP that HUD OIG officials stated regional offices are required to undertake for the Fugitive Felon Initiative. The 2018 SOP states that the HUD OIG is to track and report statistics on the number of referrals, evictions, PHA actions, and positive matches. However, the 2018 SOP does not require the HUD OIG to track the extent to which its regional offices undertake all the activities that HUD OIG officials stated regions are required to undertake, such as contacting and coordinating with relevant law enforcement agencies for the leads on the Prioritized Fugitive Felon List. By agreeing on what information on results would be useful to share, and consistently sharing this information, the HUD OIG and the FBI could enhance their ability to identify areas for improvement and evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative",
    "gao_GAO-18-67": "Why GAO Did This Study The electric power system is a vital component of the nation's economy. In the event of a power outage, the electric power system could be vulnerable to electromagnetic events (GMD), which can disrupt or damage critical electrical infrastructure. GMD can cause damage to the electric grid, including transformers, which can be vulnerable to the effects of GMD. GAO was asked to review the effects of electromagnetic events on the electric grid. This report examines (1) the extent to which U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have identified information about the potential effects of GMD and HEMP on the electric grid, (2) steps selected U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have taken to protect against GMD and HEMP events, and (3) steps selected U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers have taken to prepare for and mitigate the impact of electromagnetic events. GAO reviewed relevant studies and interviewed officials from government and industry organizations, including the Departments of Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (FERC), as well as representatives from 13 U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers. GAO also interviewed officials from FERC, DHS, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and a nongeneralizable sample of 13 selected U.S. and Canadian electricity suppliers. What GAO Found U.S. and Canadian government and industry organizations have studied and publicly reported on potential geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) effects on the electric grid. These studies have covered the general threats to the nation's electric grid from GMD but do not cover the unique aspects of individual suppliers' generation and transmission networks that could potentially make them more or less vulnerable to GMD events. In addition, these studies typically identified areas in which more research is needed regarding the GMD threat and potential mitigation measures that would inform suppliers' own assessments of the potential impact of GMD events on their unique networks. For example, of the 13 selected suppliers GAO contacted, 11 reported performing analyses to evaluate the potential impact of GMD on their specific generation systems or transmission networks. The nature of the analyses the 11 suppliers engaged in required the use of modeling software to determine the specific vulnerabilities of their networks which further allowed them to design their own mitigation measures, if warranted, to address any vulnerabilities identified and prevent equipment damage or power outages. The 11 suppliers that had performed these analyses did so in advance of all suppliers being required to analyze the vulnerabilities of their networks as part of their compliance with NERC's second-stage GMD reliability standard.

    "gao_GAO-18-101": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars each year to support military construction projects. The active component is responsible for constructing and equipping facilities to support U.S. military forces in the United States and overseas. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's MILCON appropriations. This report examines (1) the active component's MILCON obligations and expended balances, (2) the amount of MILCON reprogramming by the active component, and (3) the extent to which DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable and DOD's guidance for producing estimates fully incorporates all the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO reviewed MILCON appropriations and obligations and reprogramming data from fiscal years 2005 through 2016; reviewed DOD's guidance for developing MILCON cost estimates; and interviewed DOD and military officials. What GAO Found The active component obligated and expended most of its military construction (MILCON) appropriations during fiscal years 2005 through 2016. Of the $5.1 billion that remains unobligated, about $4.6 billion was unexpired and available for new obligations (i.e., from fiscal year 2013 through 2016 appropriations). The active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund shortfalls caused by emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding in fiscal years 2010 through 2016. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million of about $14 billion in appropriated MILCON funds; the Navy, about $535 million of about $14 billion in appropriated MILCON funds; and the Air Force, about $295 million of about $7 billion in appropriated MILCON funds. GAO's analysis of the cost estimates for three selected projects shows that the cost estimates were not reliable and DOD's guidance for producing estimates fully incorporates all the steps needed for producing reliable estimates. GAO examined the cost estimates of three high-value military construction projects and noted that the initial cost estimates increased for all three projects, with cost estimates for two of the projects increasing by over 30 percent and the other, by about 7 percent. GAO's analysis of DOD's department-wide cost estimating guidance\u2014the Unified Facilities Criteria\u2014found that the criteria did not include all of the steps needed for producing reliable cost estimates. The Unified Facilities Criteria incorporates some of the 12 steps to some degree, but not others, and as a result DOD is at a greater risk of developing estimates that are not reliable. Until DOD incorporates the 12 steps of high-quality, reliable cost estimating into this department-wide construction criteria, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD work with the military departments and other offices to improve its cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-210": "Why GAO Did This Study The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) shares Medicare beneficiary data with external entities primarily for processing Medicare claims, supporting medical research, and evaluating the performance of Medicare service and equipment providers. GAO was asked to review CMS's implementation of security protections for Medicare beneficiary data. This report examines (1) the major entities that collect, store, and process Medicare beneficiary data and that connect with CMS systems and networks; (2) whether requirements for the protection of Medicare beneficiary data align with federal guidance; and (3) the programs CMS has in place to oversee the implementation of security protections for Medicare beneficiary data. GAO analyzed CMS data maps and system documentation, interviewed CMS officials, and analyzed CMS guidance, specifically its Acceptable Risk Safeguards (ARS). What GAO Found CMS shares Medicare beneficiary data with three major types of external entities: (1) Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), the contractors that provide the core processing and distribution functions that support the payment of Medicare Part A, Part B, and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) beneficiary claims on behalf of CMS, (2) research organizations (researchers), academic and non-profit entities that use Medicare beneficiary data to assist CMS in monitoring, managing, and improving Medicare programs or the services provided to beneficiaries, and (3) qualified public or private entities that use claims data on behalf of CMS to evaluate the performance of Medicare service providers and equipment suppliers. CMS has developed requirements for implementing security controls that align with federal guidance for two of the three types of external entities that access Medicare fee-for-service data. Specifically, adherence to the requirements, which CMS defined using a risk-based process, is mandatory for MACs and qualified entities. However, CMS does not consider the requirements to be applicable to researchers because they are not CMS contractors. Without providing comprehensive, risk-based requirements for implementing security controls to all external entities that have access to Medicare beneficiary data, CMS increases the risk that external entities possessing CMS data may not have applied security controls that meet CMS standards. CMS has established a program to oversee the MACs' implementation of security and privacy protections over Medicare beneficiary data, but it does not consistently track low-risk weaknesses in the CMS FISMA Controls Tracking System. MACs are subject to two types of independent annual assessments that regularly identify weaknesses in their implementation of security controls. The assessments have identified several recurring categories of weaknesses; however, the agency does not track low-risk weaknesses that could be related to these recurring categories. Additionally, CMS has not established a corresponding program for overseeing the implementation of security controls by researchers and qualified entities. Without more consistent tracking identified issues at MACs and establishing effective oversight measures for researchers and qualified entities, CMS cannot fully ensure that the security of Medicare beneficiary data is being adequately protected. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS develop and distribute guidance for researchers defining minimum security controls and implementation guidance for those controls that is consistent with federal guidance. In commenting on a draft of this report, the department concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-47": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD supports the lead federal agency in the federal response to a major disaster or emergency. In July 2016, the White House issued the Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination (PPD-41), which established principles governing the federal government's response to cyber incidents involving government or private sector entities. In December 2016, the Department of Homeland Security issued an updated National Cyber Incident Response Plan that outlines domestic cyber-incident response coordination and execution among federal, state, territorial, and local governments. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's Section 1648 report. This report examines the extent to which DOD's Section 1648 report addressed the statutorily required elements. GAO analyzed DOD's Section 1648 report and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) did not develop a comprehensive plan; instead, the department submitted a collection of separate documents that addressed some, but not all six statutorily required elements (hereafter referred to as DOD's Section 1648 report). DOD officials agreed that their submission was not a comprehensive plan. Instead, the department submitted a collection of separate documents that, according to DOD, outline core federal, state, local, and private sector roles and responsibilities; summarize plans for coordination at all levels of government and across sectors in the event of a cyber incident; and prescribe the roles and responsibilities of the active and reserve components. DOD's Section 1648 report addressed two of the six elements required by the statute--to provide (1) descriptions of the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of federal, state, and local authorities and (2) a description of legislative and administrative actions necessary to carry out its plan to support domestic cyber incident response efforts. Specifically, DOD's Section 1648 report included copies of the PPD-41 and the Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Incident Response Plan. Both of these documents provide general descriptions of the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of federal, state, and local authorities. DOD's Section 1648 report partially addressed three of the six elements required by the statute--to provide (1) descriptions of the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of the active and reserve components of the armed forces; (2) the department's plans for coordination with heads of other federal agencies and state and local governments; and (3) a list of exercises previously conducted that are used in the formulation of the plan. DOD's Section 1648 report also includes a copy of DOD Directive 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities, which establishes DSCA policy and provides guidance for the execution and oversight of DSCA. However, GAO has previously reported that DOD's guidance does not clearly define the department's roles and responsibilities. For example, GAO found inconsistency on which combatant command would be designated the supported command and have the primary responsibility for providing support to civil authorities during a cyber incident. Consequently, as GAO recommended, DOD issued or updated guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities for relevant entities and officials to support civil authorities in a domestic cyber incident. However, key DOD documents such as DOD Directive 3025.18, DOD's Section 1648 report, and the Directive Type Memorandum issued in June 2017 do not clarify roles and responsibilities of DOD components, liaisons, and personnel who DOD had previously assigned coordination roles and responsibilities for supporting civil authorities. As a result, there is still uncertainty about these roles and responsibilities within the department. Until DOD clarifies the roles and responsibilities of its key entities for cyber incidents, as GAO recommended, department leaders and components will continue to experience uncertainty about the roles and responsibilities of different components and commands in providing support to civil authorities in the event of a significant cyber incident. DOD's Section 1648 report did not address one of the six required elements--to provide a plan for internal DOD collective training activities that are integrated with exercises conducted with other agencies and state and local governments. Instead, the department provided a classified list of planned exercises for 2017 that, according to officials, have training value for cyber incident response. DOD officials told GAO that DOD does not train for DSCA. Rather, the department trains and exercises its forces to conduct military missions and can apply the knowledge and experience from these activities to support civil authorities when requested and approved. The officials emphasized that, while exercises generally test whether DOD forces have learned training, in the case of DSCA exercises, they are a key training tool. By not including this information in this one-time report, DOD missed an opportunity to provide Congress more complete information about training that the department is",
    "gao_GAO-18-574": "Why GAO Did This Study The MHS is responsible for the administration of military treatment facilities (MTF) and is responsible for the delivery of health care to MHS beneficiaries. The MTFs are under the direction and control of the military services, which are responsible for staffing, training, and equipping those MTFs to meet mission requirements. The MHS also administers its purchased care, which includes hospitals and clinics. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 directed GAO to review the MHS's quality of care. This report examines (1) the extent to which the MHS uses a common set of quality measures for direct and purchased care, and (2) the extent to which the MHS has established performance standards and related corrective action requirements for individual civilian providers in direct and purchased care. GAO reviewed relevant DOD documents and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also reviewed the MHS's performance standards and related corrective action requirements for individual civilian providers in direct care. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Health System (MHS) does not use a common set of quality measures on its Core and Purchased Care Dashboards to assess the quality of care provided through direct and purchased care. In addition, for both direct and purchased care, the MHS uses measures on its Dashboards that assess a more limited range of quality care areas and medical conditions as compared to the Hospital Compare and the Collaborative Quality Measures (CQMC) measures adopted by Medicare and private health insurers. The MHS uses measures on its Dashboards that assess a more limited range of quality areas and medical conditions as compared to the Hospital Compare and CQMC measures adopted by Medicare and private health insurers. The limitations GAO found in the quality measures used by the MHS\u2014the relatively narrow range of measures as well as the relatively few measures used across direct and purchased care\u2014reflect the MHS's priorities in selecting quality measures. In short, the MHS focuses on the value and impact of implementing individual measures, but does not prioritize aligning the measures used across direct and purchased care or expanding the range of medical conditions and quality areas covered in the aggregate by the measures. The MHS has established performance standards in direct care related to the Core Dashboard measures and has corrective action requirements for MTFs that do not meet the standards. However, the MHS has not established performance standards related to the Purchased Care Dashboard measures for individual civilian providers in purchased care and therefore does not have related corrective action requirements for these providers. The MHS has established performance standards related to the Core Dashboard measures in direct care and has corrective action requirements for MTFs that do not meet the standards. However, the MHS has not established performance standards related to the Purchased Care Dashboard measures for individual civilian providers in purchased care and therefore does not have related corrective action requirements for these providers. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs direct the MHS to prioritize, as appropriate, the selection of measures that apply to both direct and purchased care at the provider level and that expand the range of quality measure types and medical conditions that are assessed. DOD concurred with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-4": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends about $25 billion annually to operate and support its installations. IGSAs are agreements between the military services and the local government that allow the installation to obtain installation services from the local government. IGSAs are a way to reduce costs or enhance mission effectiveness. GAO was asked to review the military services' use of IGSAs. This report examines (1) the extent to which the military services have realized financial and nonfinancial benefits from IGSAs, and (2) the extent to which the military services are monitoring the performance of IGSAs. GAO analyzed a sample of 8 IGSAs, and interviewed officials about these and other IGSAs. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from the military services and installations. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of a sample of 8 IGSAs, and interviews with officials about these and other IGSAs, found that the military services have realized financial and nonfinancial benefits from these agreements. For example, Fort Polk realized an estimated $1.9 million in cost savings by implementing an IGSA for waste removal with its local government. During the first year of implementation, Fort Polk realized an estimated $2.4 million in cost savings by implementing an IGSA for waste removal with its local government. During the same period, Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow realized an estimated $68,000 in cost savings by implementing an IGSA for water testing and analysis with the local government. Installation officials cited examples of IGSAs that led to enhanced mission effectiveness and readiness, reduced administrative time, and greater flexibility. The military services are not fully monitoring the financial and nonfinancial benefits of IGSAs because they have not established formal processes to obtain this information and documented them in their policies or procedures. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design processes, and document them in policy, to obtain relevant, accurate information that it can use to evaluate the entity's performance in achieving key objectives and make informed decisions about any needed changes. The military services have developed various approaches for supporting their installations' use of IGSAs, but they are not fully monitoring whether all of the services' installations are complying with their respective service policies to evaluate opportunities to use IGSAs to reduce costs or enhance mission effectiveness. Army headquarters officials told GAO that their efforts to date have been focused on raising awareness of IGSAs at installations and removing any obstacles that prevent IGSAs from being approved. However, Army officials stated that they currently do not monitor whether Army installations are evaluating opportunities to use IGSAs, but they said that installations may need greater encouragement from higher headquarters to use IGSAs. Thus, Army officials said they are planning to revise Army IGSA policy to include a process for obtaining information from installation officials on whether they evaluated expiring contracts for transition to IGSAs, as well as any reasons for not doing so, and expect it to be complete by the end of 2018. Additionally, the Air Force is currently using to monitor whether some of its installations are evaluating opportunities to use IGSAs for specific types of installation services. Without establishing, implementing, and documenting a process to monitor whether installations are evaluating opportunities to use IGSAs and obtain information on the outcome of those evaluations, the military services do not fully know whether their installations are conducting these evaluations, and thus may be missing opportunities to reduce costs or enhance mission effectiveness. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the military services finalize and implement a process to collect and monitor information on the extent to which all implemented IGSAs have resulted in financial and nonfinancial benefits and document their processes in policies or procedures. DOD concurred with the recommendations and non-concurred with two recommendations, but DOD's response indicates that the department plans to implement all of the actions GAO recommends.",
    "gao_GAO-18-75": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is pursuing the F-35 Lightning II program, which is intended to replace or complement legacy aircraft. The F-35 is expected to triple by the end of 2021 and keep growing as the program moves into full-rate production. GAO was asked to review DOD's F-35 sustainment efforts. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's efforts to sustain the F-35 fleet and any challenges it has faced, and (2) the extent to which DOD is positioned to enter into multi-year, performance-based sustainment contracts with the prime contractor by 2020. GAO reviewed relevant sustainment plans, guidance, and program documentation; analyzed F-35 sustainment data; and interviewed DOD and contractor officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) is sustaining more than 250 F-35 aircraft, but insufficient planning has led to significant challenges that pose risks to its ability to meet current and future warfighter readiness requirements. DOD is currently sustaining more than 250 F-35 aircraft, and the number is expected to triple by the end of 2021 and keep growing as the program moves into full-rate production. However, DOD is facing several key sustainment challenges that pose risks to its ability to meet current and future warfighter readiness requirements, and these could limit the ability of the military services to fully leverage the capabilities of the aircraft. For example, DOD does not have enough capacity to repair F-35 aircraft parts because the establishment of repair capabilities at the military depots is 6 years behind schedule. Program officials in part attributed these delays to the military services not providing enough funding for depot requirements; however, service officials told GAO that the program office did not clearly identify some depot requirements in a timely manner necessary for the services to fund those requirements. In addition, DOD did not plan for and fund the stocks of material needed to repair parts at the depots\u2014referred to as \u201clay-in material.\u201d As a result, DOD has had to fund and negotiate additional contracts with the prime contractor for the lay-in material. Currently, moreover, due in part to the late identification of requirements and funding, the lay-in material to support repairs for more than a dozen different aircraft components is not expected to be delivered to the depots until months\u2014or in some cases, years\u2014after the technical capabilities to conduct the repairs have been established. DOD has not fully defined all of the technical data it needs from the prime contractor to maximize the potential for future competition of contracts among providers for sustainment requirements, nor does it know the associated costs of these data. In 2014, GAO recommended that DOD develop a long-term Intellectual Property Strategy to identify all critical technical data needs and their associated costs. As of September 2017, the program office has taken some steps to develop an Intellectual Property Strategy, but it has not identified all critical needs and their associated costs. Moreover, the technical data needed to repair F-35 aircraft, such as maintenance instructions, are still not fully developed. DOD is developing an integrated master schedule for the deployment of global F-35 sustainment capabilities by January 2017, which is not yet completed. However, the timeframes for completion of these documents are uncertain, in part due to ongoing DOD efforts to refine its follow-on modernization plans for the F-35, which will affect the sustainment plans. Without plans that include all key requirements and decision points with aligned funding, DOD is at risk of being unable to leverage the capabilities of the aircraft it has recently purchased. DOD is testing performance-based agreements with the prime contractor as a part of its annual cost-reimbursable sustainment contracts, in order to test metrics and performance-management processes. However, important lessons are emerging from its pilot agreements with the contractor that are intended to inform the upcoming multi-year contract negotiations. DOD has not achieved most of the performance targets that it set for the pilot performance-based agreements for the 2016 sustainment contract. Subsequently, DOD negotiated lower targets for some metrics in the 2017 sustainment contract. Program officials said that the failure to meet these targets is largely due to sustainment challenges. For example, the limited availability of spare parts within the F-35 supply chain is contributing to lower than expected Air Vehicle Availability (AVA) and Full Mission Capable (FMC) rates. DOD may not be using the appropriate metrics under the pilot performance-based agreements to achieve desired outcomes. DOD guidance states that optimal performance-based contracts use objective, measurable, and manageable metrics that accurately assess the support provider's performance against the delivery of targeted warfighter outcomes. Without reexamining the metrics to ensure that they are objectively measurable, reflective of processes that the contractor can control, and able to motivate desired behaviors, DOD may",
    "gao_GAO-18-219": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. government engages with the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere through various inter-American organizations, including the Organization of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH). The United States provides voluntary contributions to these organizations through assistance agreements. GAO was asked to review issues related to these organizations. This report (1) assesses the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of U.S. agencies; (2) examines how the organizations oversee the use of their funds and the extent to which U.S. agencies have supported those efforts; (3) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies included key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements; and (4) assesses the extent to which U.S. agencies had documentation of monitoring activities, including those called for by these provisions. GAO reviewed 12 selected assistance agreements that the four U.S. agencies awarded to OAS, PAHO, and IICA that were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. GAO analyzed agency guidance and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The strategic goals of the four inter-American organizations are predominantly aligned with the high-level strategic goals for the Western Hemisphere documented by State, USAID, HHS, and USDA. The four organizations have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of assessed and voluntary contributions, such as external auditors and internal audit boards. State and USDA have directly supported these oversight mechanisms. GAO reviewed 12 selected assistance agreements that the four U.S. agencies awarded to OAS, PAHO, and IICA that were active during calendar years 2014 through 2016. GAO found that two agencies did not consistently include all key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements. While HHS and USAID implemented applicable guidance by including all key monitoring provisions in their agreements, USDA and State did not do so. USDA and State agency officials did not explain why USDA and State did not include these monitoring provisions in their agreements. However, State has since taken corrective action to ensure that they are included in future agreements, according to State officials. None of the four U.S. agencies had full documentation of all of the monitoring activities required by their agreements GAO reviewed. The agencies did not have full documentation of all of the monitoring activities for 9 of the 12 agreements GAO reviewed. For the 42 monitoring activities identified across all of the individual agreements, the four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the activities (43 percent). However, State took corrective action in May 2017 to address its gaps in documentation, and according to HHS officials, the Food and Drug Administration addressed its gap in documentation by implementing its agreement monitoring program in fiscal year 2018. USDA did not have full documentation of any of the 10 monitoring activities identified across all of the individual agreements. For one of the agreements, USDA had no documentation of the monitoring activities for that agreement. For its other two agreements, USDA did not have full documentation of the required monitoring activities. Without full documentation of the required monitoring activities, USDA may not have the information it needs to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the USAID Administrator ensure that USAID officials have full documentation of required monitoring activities in agreements with inter-American organizations. The Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that USDA includes all key monitoring provisions specified by applicable guidance as part of agreements with inter-American organizations. The Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that USDA officials have full documentation of required monitoring activities in agreements with inter-American organizations. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-87": "Why GAO Did This Study Tribes are recognized as distinct, independent political communities that are part of the unique political structure of layered sovereigns and internal governments that comprise the U.S. system of government. Tribal governments have many of the same responsibilities as state and local governments. However, tribes are generally unable to establish a strong tax base structured around the property taxes and income taxes typically available to state and local governments. To the degree that they are able, some tribes use sales and excise taxes, but these do not generally generate enough revenue to fully support tribal governments. Therefore, some tribes rely on a combination of federal funds and economic development initiatives as fundamental sources of financial support for the government programs and services provided to their communities. GAO was asked to review tribes' use of self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, and the HEARTH Act. This report examines (1) factors that can affect tribes' use of these mechanisms and (2) factors that can affect tribes' use of these mechanisms. GAO reviewed a range of reports, articles, conference proceedings, congressional testimony, and other publications from federal and tribal governments, academics, and nonprofit organizations. GAO also interviewed tribal stakeholders and federal officials. What GAO Found Several factors, including federal agencies' processes and actions, can affect tribes' use of mechanisms that further tribal self-government such as self-determination contracts, self-governance compacts, or leasing authority under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended. Some of these factors, such as federal training and resources, can help tribes develop the tribal capacity needed to take over administration of federal programs and thereby facilitate tribes' use of these mechanisms. In contrast, other factors, specifically federal processes and actions, can hinder or delay tribes' use of these mechanisms. Some of these processes include: (1) BIA's approach for sharing key information with tribes seeking to develop a program using a self-determination contract, (2) Interior's process to disburse funds to tribes associated with self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts, (3) Interior's review of tribal leasing regulations submitted under the HEARTH Act, and (4) BIA's management and maintenance of federal programs that tribes may pursue to take over under a self-determination contract. In addition, the adequacy of federal resources needed to administer a program is a factor that can affect tribes' use of self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. According to several tribal stakeholders and federal officials GAO interviewed, the Department of the Interior (Interior) has contributed to the capacity of tribal governments by increasing tribes' knowledge about self-governance compacting and the HEARTH Act. However, several factors can hinder or delay tribes' use of these mechanisms. For example, BIA's approach for sharing key information with tribes does not always ensure that tribes have the information they need to design programs under self-determination contracts. As a result, this has been a factor that has hindered or delayed tribes' use of these mechanisms. For example, BIA's approach for sharing key information with tribes does not always ensure that tribes have the information they need to design programs under self-determination contracts. As a result, this has been a factor that has hindered or delayed tribes' use of self-determination contracts. In addition, Interior's process to disburse funds associated with self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts is a factor that hinders expansion of self-determination contracts or self-governance compacts. Several tribal stakeholders and federal officials GAO interviewed said that the process does not ensure that tribes receive funds within the time frame specified in ISDEAA's Model Agreement for self-determination contracts or as agreed to by Interior and the tribes in their annual funding agreements. Interior officials said that the agency does not consider the statutory time frame to begin until it has received a final version of the proposed tribal leasing regulations. By developing a clearly documented review process that includes established time frames for each step in the process for reviewing proposed tribal leasing regulations submitted under the HEARTH Act, Interior can better ensure that it is eliminating uncertainty and better communicating the process for approval to the tribes. In addition, the adequacy of federal resources needed to administer a program is a factor that can affect tribes' use of self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. For example, a tribe reported that the Land Titles and Records Program has a shortfall of about $300",

The FSM and RMI are governed by the U.S. Constitution. The FSM and RMI are governed by the U.S. Constitution. The FSM and RMI are independent countries located about 3,000 miles southwest of Hawaii. The U.S. compacts of free association with the FSM and the RMI provide for economic assistance to the two countries, secured U.S. defense rights, and allowed FSM and RMI citizens to migrate to the United States. The FSM and RMI are required to provide U.S. assistance through the compacts. GAO was asked to review issues related to the FSM and RMI transition from compact grant assistance to relying on income from the compact trust funds. This report examines (1) the use and role of federal funds and programs in the FSM and RMI budgets, (2) projected compact trust fund disbursements and potential strategies to address risks to those disbursements, and (3) FSM and RMI efforts to prepare for the scheduled decrements in compact grant funding and the transition to relying on compact trust fund income. GAO analyzed U.S. law, the amended compacts' implementing legislation, and the programs and services agreements with each country. GAO also interviewed U.S., FSM, and RMI officials. What GAO Found The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) continue to rely on U.S. grants and programs that end in 2023. Compact sector grants and the Supplemental Education Grant (SEG) continue to support a substantial portion of government expenditures in the FSM and RMI. In the FSM, compact sector grants and the SEG support about one-third of all government expenditures. In the RMI, compact sector grants and the SEG support about one-quarter of all government expenditures. The end of the compacts' programs and services agreements in 2024 would also require the FSM and RMI to bear additional costs to provide services currently provided by the United States as part of the Agreements. GAO's updated projections for the FSM and RMI compact trust funds show similar outlooks. Several potential strategies could improve the compact trust funds' outlook; some of these strategies could be implemented under the current trust fund agreements, while other strategies may require changing the trust fund agreements. The compact trust fund committees have not yet prepared distribution policies, required by the trust fund agreements, that could assist the countries in planning for the transition to trust fund income. In addition, the committees have not established fiscal procedures for oversight of compact trust fund disbursements as required by the trust fund agreements. Further, the trust fund committees have not yet addressed a potential misalignment between the timing of their annual calculation of the amounts available for disbursement and the FSM's and RMI's budget timelines, potentially complicating each country's planning and management. The FSM and RMI did not implement planned budget reductions to address decreasing compact sector grants because of increasing revenue from other sources. FSM officials stated that they did not implement their plan's planned budgetary reductions due to increasing revenues for the state and national governments. The RMI also did not implement budget reductions but used increased revenue, particularly from fishing fees, to offset the decrement in compact sector grants. FSM and RMI strategic plans in the key sectors of education and health focus on strategic goals and priorities rather than addressing the effect of the 2023 transition on health and education budgets. However, FSM and RMI infrastructure plans discuss funding requirements and potential alternative funding sources. The FSM, the RMI, and the United States have each established bodies to plan to address issues related to the 2023 transition to trust fund income. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Interior work with other members of the compact trust fund committees to develop a distribution policy for the FSM compact trust fund, as required by the compact trust fund agreements, that takes into account potential strategies that could address risks to the fund's ability to provide a source of income after fiscal year 2023. Interior concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-119": "Why GAO Did This Study Border Patrol is responsible for securing the southwest border by interdicting illegal cross-border activity and apprehending individuals attempting to cross the border illegally. In 2011, GAO reported that CBP had not fully implemented the Southwest Border Technology Plan, which identifies technology needs and plans to extend land-based surveillance technology deployments beyond Arizona to the remainder of the southwest border. GAO was asked to review CBP's efforts to implement the Southwest Border Technology Plan. This report examines (1) the status of Border Patrol's efforts to deploy technology along the southwest border, and (2) the extent to which Border Patrol has developed guidance for future planning processes. GAO reviewed DHS and CBP documents and interviewed DHS and CBP officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has initiated or completed the planned deployment of select surveillance technologies to Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico, and has further deployment activities underway. In 2014, GAO reported that Border Patrol had made progress deploying technologies and had completed deployments for two technology programs in Arizona\u2014the Agent Portable Surveillance System (APSS) and the Thermal Imaging Device (TID) technologies. Since then, Border Patrol has completed deployments of several additional technology programs, including deploying 32 MSC systems to Texas and California. Border Patrol has also completed deployments of select technologies to Texas and California, including deploying 32 MSC systems to Texas and California. Border Patrol has revised schedules and cost estimates for its three highest-cost programs\u2014the Agent Portable Surveillance System (APSS), the Remote Ground Sensor System (VRSS), and the Mobile Surveillance System (MSC)\u2014and as of October 2017, is on track to meet those revised schedules and estimates; however, risks remain in Border Patrol's deployment efforts. Border Patrol has rebaselined (i.e., revised original schedule and cost goals) its three highest-cost programs\u2014IFT, RVSS, and MSC\u2014due to schedule, quantity, and cost estimating variances, among other changes to the programs' original plans. GAO recommended that CBP ensure that scheduling best practices are applied to the IFT, RVSS, and MSC program schedules. DHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that CBP planned to apply scheduling best practices when revising the three programs' schedules. GAO continues to believe that applying scheduling best practices in future updates will help better position CBP to identify and address any potential delays in its programs' commitment dates. Border Patrol is developing guidance to help sectors identify and plan for future technology needs and deployments, but additional actions are needed to ensure station officials understand the process and their respective roles and responsibilities. Border Patrol officials reported that the Southwest Border Technology Plan is the baseline for identifying technology needs and planning technology deployments, and that changes to the plan are needed as threats and priorities evolve. To help address these changes and remain adaptive, in 2014, Border Patrol began implementing a new process to identify future technology needs. Border Patrol officials reported that the Southwest Border Technology Plan is the baseline for identifying technology needs and planning technology deployments, and that changes to the plan are needed as threats and priorities evolve. To help address these changes and remain adaptive, in 2014, Border Patrol began implementing the Requirements Management Process (RMP), which is intended to identify capability gaps in border security operations and identify solutions to those capability gaps. Border Patrol has made progress identifying performance metrics for the technologies under the Southwest Border Technology Plan, but additional actions are needed to fully implement GAO's prior recommendations in this area. In November 2011, GAO found that CBP did not have the information needed to fully support and implement the ATP and recommended that CBP (1) determine the mission benefits to be derived from implementation of the ATP and (2) develop and apply key attributes for metrics to assess program implementation. GAO recommended, among other things, that CBP (1) analyze available data on apprehensions and seizures and technological assists, in combination with other relevant performance metrics or indicators, to determine the contribution of surveillance technologies to CBP's border security efforts. In response to GAO's recommendations, CBP has taken actions to better record asset assists and to expand the types of technologies that can be tracked, consistent with GAO's prior recommendation. However, GAO has identified issues with the completeness and reliability of the asset assist data. For example, GAO analyzed data on asset assists from October 1, 2014 through May 3, 2017 and found that agents incorrectly attributed some apprehensions and seizures to certain technologies rather than others. Border Patrol has taken actions to better record asset assists and to expand the types of technologies that can be tracked, consistent with GAO's prior recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-369": "Why GAO Did This Study The SFSP provides meals to children in low-income areas during the summer months. FNS reimburses states for meals served to children. FNS also provides flexibility to states and sponsors to help administer the SFSP. GAO was asked to review the SFSP. This report examines (1) what is known about participation in the SFSP and how has it changed in the last 10 years? (2) what other programs help feed low-income children over the summer? and (3) what challenges exist, if any, in providing summer meals to children, and to what extent does the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) provide assistance to states and sponsors to address these challenges? GAO analyzed FNS data on meals served nationwide from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, and conducted a survey of state agencies that oversee the SFSP in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. GAO also interviewed officials from FNS, national organizations, and SFSP providers in three states selected based on a mix of urban and rural locations, and SFSP sponsors. What GAO Found The total number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer\u2014one indicator of program participation\u2014increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32 percent, according to GAO's analysis of FNS data. The number of SFSP meals served has generally increased from year to year over this 10-year period. Most recently, meals decreased by 6 percent from 156 million meals in summer 2015 to 149 million meals in summer 2016, according to GAO's analysis of FNS data. Factors that may have affected year-to-year fluctuations include changes in funding for summer programs, sponsor participation, weather, and the number of weekdays available for sites to serve meals within a given summer. FNS estimates the number of children participating in the SFSP, and information obtained from GAO's state survey and FNS indicate that these estimates have been calculated inconsistently and are unreliable. FNS instructs state agencies on how to calculate a statewide estimate of children's participation in the SFSP, referred to as average daily attendance (ADA), using sponsor-reported information on the number of meals served and days of operation in July of each year. However, states' methods for calculating ADA have differed from state to state and from year to year, according to GAO's review of states' survey responses and FNS documents. For example, although FNS directed states to include the number of meals served in each site's primary meal service\u2014which may or may not be lunch\u2014some states, according to GAO's survey and FNS data, were calculating ADA using only meals served at lunch. FNS officials told GAO that these states were therefore not following the agency's instructions. Further, some states have changed their methods for calculating ADA over time\u2014five states reported in GAO's survey that the method they used to calculate ADA in fiscal year 2016 differed from the one they used previously. While FNS clarified its instructions in May 2017 to help improve the consistency of states' ADA calculations moving forward, ADA remains an unreliable estimate of children's daily participation in the SFSP because it currently does not account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves meals to children. According to GAO's analysis, ADA is also an unreliable estimate of children's participation in the SFSP because it currently does not account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves meals to children. According to GAO's analysis, ADA is also an unreliable estimate of children's participation in the SFSP because it currently does not account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves meals to children.

The transition enables the use of IP-based technology to provide 911 services, including routing calls and data. The National 911 Program, the lead federal entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, is responsible for coordinating the implementation of NG911 nationwide. GAO was asked to review the implementation of NG911 and the challenges states and localities may be encountering. This report examines (1) progress states and localities are making to implement NG911 and the challenges they have faced and (2) how federal agencies have addressed state and local implementation challenges and planned next steps. GAO analyzed state-provided data on NG911 implementation and fee collection and costs, and interviewed federal officials, industry stakeholders, and state and local 911 officials from nine states selected based on a variety of factors, including reported progress in implementing NG911, statewide planning and coordination, number of annual 911 calls, whether states diverted 911 fees to other uses, and variation in geographic location. What GAO Found According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) most recent national survey, state and local progress implementing Next Generation 911 (NG911) varies, and about half of all states reported being in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015. While a few states are well into statewide implementation, NHTSA officials told GAO that no state had completely implemented all NG911 functions. Additionally, as of the fall of 2017, none of the selected states GAO spoke with were processing multimedia\u2014such as images or audio/video recordings\u2014through their 911 systems due to concerns related to privacy, liability, and the ability to store and manage these types of data, among other things. Federal officials, industry stakeholders, and state and local 911 officials GAO interviewed from nine states identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911, including challenges related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. Federal agencies are taking actions to assist state and local 911 entities to address NG911 implementation challenges, but the National 911 Program lacks goals and performance measures to assess whether these activities are achieving desired results. The National 911 Program has taken a variety of actions to assist the state and local 911 community, in collaboration with other federal agencies. However, the program lacks goals and related performance measures to assess whether these activities are achieving desired results.

    "gao_GAO-19-56": "Why GAO Did This Study SNAP E&T is a federally funded program that provides employment and training services to SNAP recipients. FNS has made strides in recent years to provide additional support and oversight of states' SNAP E&T programs, but the agency lacks complete and accurate information on these programs, which may limit the effectiveness of its efforts. GAO was asked to review the extent to which state SNAP E&T programs have partnered with other programs offering similar services. This report examines (1) what is known about SNAP E&T program participants and outcomes over time and (2) the extent to which state SNAP E&T programs have partnered with other programs offering similar services. GAO analyzed FNS data on SNAP E&T participants and outcomes over time and interviewed FNS and state officials. GAO also reviewed FNS data on SNAP E&T expenditures and state plans for SNAP E&T. What GAO Found The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) employment and training (E&T) program has served a small and decreasing percentage of overall SNAP recipients over time, and although these data are generally reliable, FNS data on SNAP E&T program participant characteristics and outcomes are not reliable. State SNAP E&T programs have served a small percentage of SNAP recipients over the last decade potentially due in part to certain policy changes during that time, such as the increasing number of states moving from mandatory to voluntary SNAP E&T programs. The number of SNAP recipients served by SNAP E&T programs has also potentially been low because a limited number of those referred to state programs go on to participate in services. FNS's lack of reliable SNAP E&T data, as well as the agency's lack of a plan for using newly reported participant characteristics and outcome data to assess program performance, constrain FNS's ability to understand the extent to which agency goals are being met. FNS officials told GAO that they have not determined how they will use newly reported data to assess the performance of state SNAP E&T programs. Without such information, states, FNS, and the Congress are unable to fully assess whether agency goals are being met through the SNAP E&T program. Further, the lack of reliable state-reported data on SNAP recipients subject to work requirements and participation in SNAP E&T affects FNS's ability to monitor states' implementation of program rules, including work requirements, and ensure program integrity. In addition, FNS has not yet determined how it will use newly reported data to assess the performance of state SNAP E&T programs. Federal internal control standards state that management should determine whether performance measures for defined objectives are appropriate for evaluating the agency's performance in achieving those objectives. Federal internal control standards also state that management should communicate necessary quality information to relevant internal and external parties to help the agency achieve its objectives. States have increasingly partnered with other entities to provide SNAP E&T services, but some states have not yet fully leveraged available workforce development system resources for SNAP E&T. According to FNS data for fiscal year 2018, 20 state SNAP agencies have not partnered with workforce agencies for SNAP E&T. According to FNS officials, the nationwide network of more than 2,500 American Job Centers, which are operated by state and local workforce agencies, can help to fill service gaps in areas lacking community based organizations or community colleges. However, despite the broad availability of E&T services such as job search assistance through American Job Centers, 12 state SNAP agencies directly provided job search or job search training for their SNAP E&T programs, according to their fiscal year 2017 state SNAP E&T plans. In addition, some states have not yet fully leveraged resources from the broader workforce development system, which includes workforce agencies, community-based organizations, and community colleges, to provide SNAP E&T services. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should collect complete and reliable information to ensure effective monitoring. FNS officials told GAO that they do not independently assess the availability of states' workforce development system partners but instead rely on states to document this information in their state SNAP E&T plans, a key tool used by FNS for program monitoring. However, 24 states did not provide information in their fiscal year 2017 SNAP E&T plans that would allow FNS to verify whether these states had assessed available workforce development system providers. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should collect complete and reliable information to ensure effective monitoring. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FNS (1) identify and disseminate strategies to states and service providers for increasing the participation of SNAP recipients",
    "gao_GAO-18-456": "Why GAO Did This Study The B61-12 LEP is to replace the B61 bombs it replaces. The program plans to complete the LEP in fiscal year 2025, with a first production unit date of March 2020. GAO was asked to review the B61-12 LEP. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA incorporated best practices in developing the program's cost estimate and (2) the extent to which NNSA and DOD have identified and are managing risks that could affect the program's completion date. GAO analyzed NNSA and DOD documents and interviewed officials from NNSA and DOD. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) substantially incorporated most of the cost estimating best practices identified by GAO's past work when it developed the $7.6 billion program cost estimate for the B61-12 life extension program (LEP). GAO's cost estimating guide identifies best practices for developing a high-quality, reliable cost estimate and identifies four characteristics of such an estimate: it is comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. These four characteristics and some of the best practices that underlie them are illustrated in the figure. The program's cost estimate differs from the $10 billion independent cost estimate primarily because the program office used different methods and assumptions than the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation, which prepared the independent cost estimate. The B61-12 program developed its estimate by compiling site-specific cost and schedule estimates for activities at each of the NNSA sites participating in the LEP; in contrast, the independent cost estimate projected a cost and completion date by evaluating program activities completed to date and applying a historical model to estimate costs and durations for remaining activities. To reconcile the differences between the two estimates, high-ranking NNSA officials met with officials from the B61-12 program office and the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation to discuss the estimates in 2016. However, NNSA did not document the rationale for its decision to use the program office's lower estimate unchanged or a plan for how it would take the independent cost estimate into consideration. GAO previously recommended that NNSA establish a requirement for its management to document and justify key decisions based on a reconciliation of LEP cost estimates with the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation's independent cost estimates. NNSA agreed with this recommendation. NNSA and DOD have identified and are managing various risks that could complicate efforts to meet the fiscal year 2025 completion date for the B61-12 LEP. Some of these risks that the agencies are managing are within the program's areas of responsibility, such as an aggressive flight test schedule. Additional risks could be identified within these areas. To manage risks, the program uses a formal risk management process and has taken steps such as consolidating flight tests and holding more regular meetings between NNSA's design and production agencies. The program also faces risks that program officials told GAO lie outside the program's direct control\u2014such as risks related to the F-35 delivery aircraft, nuclear certification, and NATO coordination issues\u2014and officials said they have provided information to the responsible DOD organizations to help address these risks. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-589": "Why GAO Did This Study The Bureau's 2020 Census is the most expensive in U.S. history at about $12.3 billion, and is about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020 constant dollars). The Bureau relies on a complete and accurate address list to maximize the more cost-efficient self-responding rate. GAO has previously reported that a reliable schedule can provide a road map for systematic execution of a program, and the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential problems, and promote accountability. GAO was asked to review the extent to which the Bureau is using leading practices for scheduling key projects. This report assesses the extent to which the Bureau is using leading practices for scheduling key projects. GAO selected three projects from the December 17, 2017, version of the 2020 Census integrated master schedule. GAO compared the three schedules to leading practices for scheduling. GAO also interviewed Bureau officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is using leading practices for scheduling key projects. GAO has previously reported that a reliable schedule can provide a road map for systematic execution of a program, and the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential problems, and promote accountability. The Bureau's schedules for the three projects GAO reviewed better reflected two of the four characteristics of a reliable schedule compared to GAO's 2013 assessment of the Bureau's schedule. For example, the schedules for the three projects reflect the work to be accomplished for the project schedules, and each project schedule includes estimates of the duration of each activity. Additionally, the Bureau's 2020 Census Research and Testing and Geographic Support System Initiative schedules contain clear start and finish milestones, and map to the census program work breakdown structure--a detailed definition of the work necessary to accomplish a program's objectives. However, the Bureau has not fully met the characteristics of a comprehensive schedule because the Bureau has not created a corresponding dictionaries to define the work. The absence of such a dictionary could potentially lead to confusion among staff in different census offices about the scope of the work they are responsible for performing. The Bureau's 2020 Schedule Management Plan states that it is the responsibility of a representative from a project team and the schedule staff to assign resources to an individual project schedule, and that defining and assigning resources should be done following the testing phase of the 2020 Census Lifecycle. However, the Bureau has not yet determined the resources needed for each project schedule. Without resource loading, the Bureau's risk of key end-to-end test milestones slipping increases significantly. In 2009, GAO recommended that the Bureau include estimates of the resources in the 2020 integrated schedule for each activity as the schedule was built. The Department of Commerce did not respond to the recommendation at that time. In 2013, GAO assessed the Bureau's schedule using these criteria. While the results exhibited some of the characteristics of a reliable schedule, important weaknesses remained. Both schedules substantially met one of the four characteristics (controlled) and minimally or partially met the other three characteristics (comprehensive, well-constructed, and credible). For example, the schedules for the Geographic Programs project schedule partially met the well-constructed characteristic because of problems existing within the schedule's sequencing logic. In particular, GAO found a large number of unjustified date constraints and lags. In part because of these sequencing issues, total float calculations--that is, the amount of time a predecessor activity can slip before its delay affects the program's estimated finish date--appear unreasonably high. Additionally, the 2020 Census Geographic Programs project schedule partially met the well-constructed characteristic because of problems existing within the schedule's sequencing logic.

What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) generally followed standard operating procedures when assessing aviation security at Cuban airports in fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Specifically, TSA inspectors generally followed standard operating procedures for documenting foreign airport assessment results as required by TSA's 2010 and 2016 Foreign Airport Assessment Program Standard Operating Procedures and Global Risk Analysis and Decision Support (GRADS) Business Rules. Similarly, TSA inspectors generally followed standard operating procedures for documenting air carrier inspection results in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as required by the PARIS Business Rules. TSA also resolved reported deficiencies in a timely manner, and conducted foreign airport assessments at established intervals as required by TSA's 2010 and 2016 procedures. GAO's analysis of TSA air carrier inspection data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016\u2014a period in which public charter flights accounted for nearly all commercial air traffic between the United States and Cuba\u2014found that TSA did not always inspect air carriers operating U.S.-bound flights from Cuba each fiscal year at frequencies established in its standard operating procedures. For example, GAO's analysis revealed that TSA inspected an air carrier in September 2013 and April 2015, but did not do so in fiscal year 2014\u2014a year in which this air carrier operated a total of 127 U.S.-bound flights. TSA officials explained that host government requests to reschedule inspections and the flight schedule data used to track public charter flights hinder TSA's efforts to inspect 100 percent of air carriers operating U.S.-bound public charter flights in Cuba. TSA officials acknowledged that a tool that better corroborates and validates the flight schedule data TSA uses to track air carriers requiring inspection each fiscal year would improve the reliability of these data and help TSA ensure air carrier inspections in Cuba occur at the frequency established in its standard operating procedures. TSA found mixed levels of compliance with ICAO standards and recommended practices at Cuban airports during fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Specifically, of the Cuban airport assessments TSA conducted during this period, several resulted in no findings\u2014meaning that TSA inspectors determined the airport was fully compliant with each ICAO standard and recommended practice the airport was assessed against. Of the remaining foreign airport assessments that did result in findings, TSA inspectors found that most of the airports were fully compliant with all but one or two of the ICAO standards and recommended practices. The instances of noncompliance fall within the following five categories: Access Control: During an assessment at one airport, TSA inspectors observed that a section of fencing along the perimeter had deteriorated and needed repair. TSA inspectors subsequently recommended that the fencing be repaired and, during a follow-up visit, TSA inspectors observed that the baggage conveyor belt door was properly secured. Passenger and Baggage Security: During an assessment at one airport, TSA inspectors observed an issue with passenger screening. TSA officials stated that they plan to follow up on these findings during their next scheduled assessments. TSA's air carrier inspection results show that, among the air carriers operating U.S.-bound scheduled commercial and public charter flights from Cuba that TSA inspected in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, more than two-thirds of these inspections resulted in no findings. A result of no findings means that TSA inspectors determined that air carriers operating these flights fully implemented all requirements in their TSA-approved security program at the time of inspection. For example, air carriers fully implemented security requirements such as access controls, area security, and checked baggage screening. TSA also found that air carriers generally implemented requirements concerning signs and notifications, passenger screening, and aircraft search at the time of inspection. For the one-third of inspections where air carriers had not fully implemented requirements, issues ranged from failure to notify U.S.-bound passengers that carry-on items and checked baggage are subject",
    "gao_GAO-18-214": "Why GAO Did This Study CBP is responsible for enforcing the laws relating to the importation and exportation of merchandise into and out of the United States. CBP has implemented a policy and procedures requiring CBP officials at airports to contact experts within a centralized CBP office to verify licenses for radiological material being shipped into the United States. GAO was asked to review CBP's policies and procedures. This report examines (1) the extent to which CBP has verified licenses for shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material and (2) the extent to which CBP's policies and procedures ensure that only properly licensed radiological material is imported into the United States. GAO reviewed CBP's policies and procedures and interviewed CBP officials at four airports selected based on the number of shipments of potentially dangerous radiological material imported from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has not verified all licenses for radiological materials as required in its policy and procedures. During the 21-month period GAO reviewed, CBP officials stationed at airports across the country did not verify the legitimacy of a significant number of shipments CBP considered as containing potentially dangerous radiological material. CBP officials at two of the four airports GAO visited may not have verified the legitimacy of licenses for many of the shipments of radiological material imported during the 21-month period, which was not consistent with CBP policy. After GAO brought this issue to CBP's attention, it issued additional guidance. However, this guidance was not clear and caused confusion at the two airports GAO visited where actions continued to be taken that were not consistent with CBP policy. CBP policies and procedures are not effective at ensuring that only properly licensed radiological material is imported into the United States. Specifically, CBP's procedures for identifying licensable radiological material do not ensure that all shipments of radiological material are identified and verified, resulting in the exclusion of a significant number of shipments that possibly contained radioactive material during the 21-month period GAO reviewed. Moreover, CBP's current policy and procedures treat all radiological shipments with the same level of scrutiny and do not target resources based on the risk of the material. Details about these issues are omitted from this report because the information was deemed to be sensitive by CBP. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CBP develop a monitoring system to help ensure that CBP officials comply with license verification policies and procedures. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-484T": "Why GAO Did This Study The St. Elizabeths campus at St. Elizabeths, Maryland, is the largest multiphase project in the history of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The project is intended to consolidate the headquarters of DHS and its contractors into a single, integrated campus. DHS and GSA are responsible for managing the project. This testimony discusses GAO's September 2014 report on the project, which examined (1) DHS and GSA consolidation plans and (2) DHS and GSA cost and schedule estimates for the project. This statement is based on GAO's September 2014 report, which was issued in September 2014 and selected updates conducted in April 2018. What GAO Found In its September 2014 report, GAO found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) planning for the headquarters consolidation did not fully conform with leading capital decision-making practices intended to help agencies effectively plan and procure assets. Specifically, GAO found that DHS and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address funding issues as reflected in leading practices. DHS and GSA officials reported that they had taken some initial actions that may facilitate consolidation planning in a manner consistent with leading practices. However, GAO found that the consolidation plans, which were finalized between 2006 and 2009, had not been updated to reflect these actions. In addition, GAO found that funding for the St. Elizabeths project had not aligned with what DHS and GSA initially planned. GAO reported that this gap created cost escalations of over $1 billion and schedule delays of over 10 years relative to original estimates. GAO found in 2014 that these delays posed challenges for DHS in terms of its long-term leasing portfolio. GAO continues to believe that DHS and GSA attention to following leading capital decision-making practices\u2014including having a consolidation plan that justifies future actions\u2014is critical given the project's multi-billion dollar cost and impact on departmental operations. In its September 2014 report, GAO found that DHS and GSA cost and schedule estimates for the headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths did not conform or only minimally or partially conformed with leading estimating practices, and were therefore unreliable. For example, GAO found that the 2013 cost estimate\u2014the most recent available at the time of GAO's review\u2014did not include (1) a life-cycle cost analysis of the project, including the cost of repair, operations, and maintenance; (2) was not regularly updated to reflect significant changes to the program including actual costs; and (3) did not include an independent estimate to determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results. In addition, a sensitivity and a risk and uncertainty analysis had not been performed to assess the reasonableness of the cost estimate. GAO has previously reported that a reliable cost estimate is critical to the success of any program. GAO recommended that DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project in accordance with leading practices. DHS and GSA concurred with the recommendation. As of April 2018, however, the agencies had not submitted revised cost and schedule information to Congress that would either meet the requirements of the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act or address GAO's recommendation. GSA is leading efforts to revise the project's cost and schedule estimates, and according to GSA officials, the revised figures will take into account leading cost- and schedule-estimating practices, including a risk assessment. GAO continues to believe that creating up-to-date, reliable cost and schedule estimates for DHS headquarters consolidation should be an integral part of DHS and GSA efforts to reassess the project. DHS did not consistently apply its major acquisition guidance for reviewing and approving the headquarters consolidation project. Specifically, GAO found that DHS had guidelines in place to provide senior management the opportunity to review and approve its major projects, but DHS had not consistently applied these guidelines to its efforts to work with GSA to plan and implement headquarters consolidation. Part of the inconsistency was the result of DHS designating the headquarters consolidation project as a major acquisition in some years but not in others. For example, in 2010 and 2011, DHS identified the headquarters consolidation project as a major acquisition and included the project on DHS's Major Acquisitions Oversight List. Thus, the project was subject to the oversight and management policies and procedures established in DHS major acquisition guidance; however, the project did not comply with major acquisition requirements as outlined by DHS guidelines. For example, GAO found that the project had not produced any of the required key acquisition documents requiring department-level approval, such as life-cycle cost estimates",
    "gao_GAO-19-17": "Why GAO Did This Study The Buy American Act of 1933 establishes a preference for domestic end products, such as aircraft parts, and requires federal agencies to procure foreign end products through exceptions to the Buy American Act. The Buy American Act also requires that the federal government certify that the products it buys are domestic and, if necessary, declare the foreign countries from which they provide products. GAO was asked to review the extent to which (1) the federal government procures foreign products through Buy American Act exceptions and waivers; and (2) selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the Buy American Act requirements. GAO analyzed federal procurement data for fiscal year 2017 and interviewed officials from the Office of Management and Budget, DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA. GAO also reviewed 38 contracts and task orders from four agencies\u2014DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA\u2014to identify the extent to which they applied the Buy American Act requirements. What GAO Found In fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated approximately $7.8 billion for the acquisition of foreign end products, which accounts for less than 5 percent of total federal contract obligations for end products in that year. GAO observed differences in how civilian agencies and DOD apply Buy American Act exceptions and waivers. In GAO's review of 38 contracts and orders from four agencies\u2014DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA\u2014GAO found 6 instances where the place of manufacture information was misreported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). GAO further identified system limitations in how FPDS-NG captures information. For example, FPDS-NG does not allow for one country of origin to be identified. Further, FPDS-NG does not prevent agencies from reporting trade agreement waivers when the contracts are valued below applicable thresholds or waivers do not apply, such as for small business set asides. GAO Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government state that management should use quality information to support objectives, and that such data should be complete and accurate. Ensuring that the data are accurate and complete is critical because the data are used to inform procurement policy decisions and facilitate congressional oversight. The four agencies GAO reviewed\u2014DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA\u2014took different approaches to provide training and guidance for the Buy American Act requirements. For example, DOD updated its training course in 2017 to emphasize the importance of meeting Buy American Act requirements, but it has not added training or provided specific guidance. In addition, DHS and DOD have recently updated existing training or added new training and guidance. VA issued policy memoranda in 2017 emphasizing the importance of meeting Buy American Act requirements, but has not added training or provided specific guidance. HHS does not provide department-level training or guidance related to the Buy American Act. Most of the DHS and DOD contracting officers GAO spoke to reported that they had attended training and several found the guidance provided by the training to be helpful. HHS and VA contracting officials described confusion due to the lack of resources available at their respective agencies. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget instruct the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to facilitate additional training to improve the understanding of the contracting workforce regarding the Buy American Act requirements; clarify revisions to FPDS-NG, where needed, and provide training and guidance for recording Buy American Act information in FPDS-NG to improve the accuracy of the Buy American data; and provide training and guidance for recording Buy American Act information in FPDS-NG to improve the accuracy of the Buy American data. DOD, HHS, DHS, and VA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-51": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government plans to invest about $96 billion in fiscal year 2018 for IT that is critical to the health, economy, and security of the nation. However, prior IT expenditures have often resulted in significant cost overruns, schedule delays, and questionable mission-related achievements. In 2015, GAO added improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to its list of high-risk areas. GAO was asked to review the status of federal IT acquisitions and operations. This report examines (1) the extent to which OMB identified and reported to Congress on the top 10 high priority IT programs, and (2) the extent to which USDS is involved in these programs. GAO reviewed OMB and USDS reports and interviewed OMB staff and officials from the E-Gov office, the Federal Chief Information Officer (Federal CIO), and the U.S. Small Business Service (USDS). What GAO Found The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported that it undertook a structured approach to identifying the top 10 high priority information technology (IT) programs it reported to Congress in June 2015 and June 2016. Specifically, staff in the E-Gov office, including the Unit Chief for the Agency Oversight and Implementation team, stated that they chose the top 10 programs from a list of high impact programs that OMB separately maintains. They added that their approach was not guided by any documented procedures or scoring techniques to distinguish the programs. In addition, staff in the Federal CIO office stated that they identified on the high impact list those programs that they believed were representative of the most important IT programs across federal agencies. They also considered other factors, such as risk exposure, public impact, public use, criticality to agency mission, size, and cost. In addition, they considered input from USDS leadership and OMB budget examiners, as well as GAO reports, inspectors general reports, and CIO risk ratings. Further, staff in the Federal CIO office stated that they identified on the high impact list those programs that they believed were representative of the most important IT programs across federal agencies. They added that the Federal CIO then approved the list of top 10 programs that they had selected. OMB subsequently issued two reports to Congress\u2014in June 2015 and June 2016\u2014that identified the top 10 high priority programs. Along with the status of each program, the reports identified the IT investments that were a part of each program as well as total IT spending, average CIO risk rating, major milestones, and the level of involvement USDS has with the program. OMB issued two reports on the high priority programs\u2014one in 2015 and another in 2016. While these reports provided the requested information they were not issued quarterly, according to the E-Gov staff, OMB was not able to report quarterly on the programs because of other competing reporting requirements, limited resources available to draft the report, and the amount of time it takes to get its reports fully reviewed. Moreover, the staff stated that they stopped issuing the high priority reports in 2016 because they believe the explanatory statement to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, no longer directed them to continue reporting on the programs. Specifically, the explanatory statement directed USDS to provide a quarterly report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate describing the status of current USDS teams and projects, including the top 10 high priority programs, a list of USDS accomplishments, and agency project proposals. Both E-Gov staff and USDS staff said they determined this to mean that OMB should report on the USDS projects considered to be high priority given USDS's responsibilities. In addition, USDS staff stated that they did not receive any feedback from congressional stakeholders indicating otherwise. However, continued identification and reporting on the top ten high priority programs, and not just USDS projects, would further enhance congressional oversight by providing congressional stakeholders with information on high priority programs that is not readily available. Such information could also be useful for current administration IT governance entities such as the Office of American Innovation and the American Technology Council, to assist them with prioritizing their efforts to modernize federal agency IT. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB continue to identify and report to Congress on the status of the top 10 high priority IT programs and the extent to which USDS is involved in the programs, as was done in June 2015 and June 2016. In doing so, the Director should ensure that these reports are issued quarterly. OMB disagreed with GAO's conclusions that the lack of personal Federal CIO involvement in high priority IT programs had resulted in inadequate oversight. GAO continues to believe that GAO's recommendation to ensure that the Federal CIO is directly involved in overseeing high priority programs is appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-74": "Why GAO Did This Study GPS is a national asset for civilians and the military service members who depend upon it each day. Any disruption to the system would have severe economic and military consequences. In keeping the system sustained and modernized with additional capabilities, DOD has spent billions of dollars more than planned developing five interdependent GPS programs. GAO was asked to review the GPS acquisition. This report examines (1) the extent to which there are acquisition risks to sustaining the GPS constellation, (2) the risks that a delay in the acquisition and fielding of GPS III satellites could result in the GPS constellation falling below the 24 satellites required by the standard positioning service and precise positioning service performance standards, and (3) the extent to which DOD faces acquisition challenges developing a new ground system to control the broadcast of a modernized GPS signal. GAO reviewed program documentation and interviewed officials from the Air Force, the Air Force Space Command, and the prime contractors. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has made some progress toward ensuring continued constellation sustainment since GAO's September 2015 report and should be able to sustain the current service because of the length of life of the current satellites. The current GPS constellation is now projected to meet its availability performance standard (in the absence of operational GPS III satellites) into June 2021\u2014an increase of nearly 2 years over previous projections. This increase will give the Air Force more schedule buffer in the event of any additional delays to the GPS III satellite program. However, the Air Force still faces technical risks and schedule pressures in both the short and long term. In the short term, schedule compression with the first GPS III satellite is placing the satellite's launch and operation at risk of further delays. In the long term, most of the satellites under contract will have been launched before operational testing is completed, limiting Air Force corrective options if issues are discovered. The Air Force has established high-risk schedules for modernizing the GPS broadcast, or M-code signal, produced by GPS satellites. These risks are manifest in different ways. In the near term, the Air Force plans to provide a limited M-code broadcast\u2014one that does not have all of the capabilities of OCX\u2014in the MGUE program in fiscal year 2020. However, the MCEU schedule is high risk for its dependency on the timely completion of the COps program, for its aggressive schedule, and because of competition for limited test resources. Further, the full M-code broadcast capability, planned for fiscal year 2022, is at high risk of additional delays because (1) it is dependent on unproven efficiencies in software coding, (2) the program has not yet completed a baseline review, which may identify additional time needed to complete currently contracted work, and (3) there are known changes to the program that must be done that are not included in the proposed schedule. DOD has developed preliminary\u2014but incomplete\u2014plans to fully develop and field M-code receiver cards across the more than 700 weapon systems that will need to make the transition from the current technology. DOD has prepared initial cost and schedule estimates for department-wide fielding for a fraction of these weapon systems. While the full cost remains unknown, it is likely to be many billions of dollars greater than the $2.5 billion identified through fiscal year 2021 because there is significant work remaining to verify the initial cards work as planned and to develop them further after the MGUE increment 1 program ends. Without greater coordination of integration test results, lessons learned, and design solutions, DOD is at risk of duplicated development work as multiple weapon system programs separately mature and field similar technologies on their own. Further, with the full M-code broadcast available in fiscal year 2022, a gap\u2014the extent of which is unknown\u2014between operationally broadcasting and receiving M-code exists. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD assign an organization with responsibility for systematically collecting integration test data, lessons learned, and design solutions and making them available to all programs expected to integrate M-code receiver cards. DOD concurred with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-210": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS is responsible for coordinating and coordinating its R&D efforts. DHS's Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is responsible for coordinating and coordinating all DHS R&D activities. GAO was asked to review DHS's R&D efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS has obligated more than $1 billion per fiscal year from 2010 through 2017 for conducting R&D that aligns with DHS mission areas, and (2) the extent to which DHS has taken steps to identify and track DHS's R&D project information. GAO analyzed DHS R&D funding data for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found DHS has obligated more than $10 billion per fiscal year from 2010 through 2017 for conducting research and development (R&D) that aligns with DHS mission areas across seven DHS components. S&T generally leads or funds R&D projects by providing technology and knowledge products for four homeland security areas: disaster resilience, community resilience to natural disasters, critical incidents, and border security. DHS established a process to coordinate R&D efforts across the department, in accordance with recommendations GAO made in 2012. The process consists of three activities: 1) identifying R&D activities in progress, funded, planned, or recently completed; 2) prioritizing technological capability gaps and corresponding R&D efforts to address those gaps; and 3) validating and reporting the gaps. DHS issued guidance in 2015 and 2016 defining research and development activities and establishing Integrated Product Teams (IPT) as the central mechanism to coordinate R&D efforts across the department. However, DHS guidance does not specifically address steps to be taken if components do not adhere to the requirements. By ensuring that all required components participate in the IPT process, DHS can help S&T maintain visibility of R&D projects in order to fulfill its statutory role of coordinating R&D. Since 2012, S&T has taken steps to identify and track information related to ongoing R&D projects across DHS, and in 2017, DHS developed a common appropriations structure that standardized R&D budgeting processes across the department. However, S&T's efforts to identify and track R&D project information have limitations and can result in information that is not comprehensive. For example, S&T's efforts to maintain an inventory of R&D projects across DHS have resulted in reporting that is not comprehensive. For example, S&T's 2016 and 2017 reports of coordinated R&D identified R&D activities and projects across DHS. However, S&T's efforts to identify and track R&D project information have limitations and can result in information that is not comprehensive. For example, S&T's efforts to maintain an inventory of R&D projects across DHS have resulted in reporting that is not comprehensive. By developing a mechanism to address challenges and limitations related to the collection, integration, and comprehensiveness of R&D data across the department, S&T can improve its visibility on R&D efforts across DHS in accordance with its role as DHS's coordinator of R&D efforts. DHS components have processes in place to collect certain indicators of R&D performance, but GAO found that these processes have limitations. For example, GAO found that 3 of the 14 milestones fully adhered to DHS guidance for milestone descriptions. DHS budget development guidance suggests DHS components, which develop milestones for inclusion in congressional budget justification documents, utilize leading practices provided in the guidance. However, more than half of the milestones (8 of 14) were not specific and 10 of 14 were not results-oriented. Without milestone information that more closely aligns with DHS guidance, Congress and DHS decision-makers may not be able to fully assess whether R&D projects are meeting specific goals within assigned time frames or identify what adjustments, if any, may be needed to facilitate the achievement of project goals and the R&D mission overall. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS ensure that all components adhere to IPT participation requirements, develop a mechanism for collecting R&D project data, and develop standard processes and procedures for collecting and analyzing customer feedback. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",

EXIM is authorized to provide financing on a competitive basis with other ECAs and must submit annual reports to Congress on its actions. GAO was asked to review EXIM's underwriting policies and procedures. This report examines the extent to which (1) EXIM's (1) process for updating its underwriting policies and procedures is properly designed and implemented and (2) underwriting policies and procedures for loan and loan guarantee transactions are consistent with guidance for managing federal credit programs. GAO reviewed EXIM's underwriting policies and procedures and interviewed EXIM officials. What GAO Found The Export-Import Bank's (EXIM) underwriting policies and procedures were mostly consistent with federal guidance for managing federal credit programs. GAO evaluated these policies and procedures for (1) applicant screening, (2) loan documentation, (3) collateral requirements, (4) lender and servicer eligibility, and (5) risk sharing practices. EXIM's underwriting policies and procedures were generally consistent with federal guidance related to applicant screening, loan documentation, collateral requirements, lender and servicer eligibility, and risk sharing practices. However, EXIM's underwriting process could be improved by additional procedures. For example, the Manual did not address medium-term delegated authority lenders' eligibility requirements for continued participation and decertification procedures for lenders who fail to meet agency's standards. Further, EXIM has not documented its process for periodically reviewing credit programs in which the government bears more than 80 percent of any loss to determine whether private sector lenders should bear a greater share of the risk. Improvements in these areas could help enhance the oversight of lenders and the usefulness of program reviews. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EXIM (1) document policies and procedures for determining medium-term delegated authority lenders' eligibility for continued participation in EXIM's programs and (2) decertify or take other appropriate actions for such lenders that do not meet compliance or eligibility standards. EXIM concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-208": "Why GAO Did This Study VA relies on VistA\u2014its health information system\u2014to assist in the daily operations of providing health care to patients. Since 2001, VA has made numerous enhancements to the functionality of VistA, including the release of the Computerized Patient Record System in 1996. In 2015, an independent assessment of health IT at VA raised questions regarding the lack of any clear advances made during the past decade with VistA and the increasing amount of time needed for VA to release new capabilities. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to modernize VistA. This report (1) identifies the efforts that VA has undertaken to modernize VistA, including key contractors, contract costs, and expected contractor activities and (2) determines the department's current plans for, and progress to date, in modernizing VistA. GAO reviewed VA's prior budget submissions, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found Since 2001, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has pursued four efforts to modernize its Veterans Health Information System (VistA). These efforts\u2014HealtheVet, the integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR), VistA Evolution, and the Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM)\u2014reflect varying approaches that the department has considered to achieve a modernized health care system over the course of nearly two decades. These efforts include the HealtheVet initiative, which was scheduled to be fully implemented by 2018 at a total estimated development and deployment cost of about $11 billion. In February 2011, VA began its second VistA modernization initiative, the iEHR program, in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD). The program was intended to replace the two separate electronic health record systems used by the two departments with a single, shared system. In December 2013, VA initiated its VistA Evolution program, which was to be comprised of a collection of projects and efforts focused on improving the efficiency and quality of veterans' health care by modernizing the department's health information systems, increasing the department's data exchange and interoperability with DOD and private sector health care partners, and reducing the time it takes to deploy new health information management capabilities. VA is currently in the process of revising its plan for the program as a result of the department recently announcing its pursuit of a fourth VistA modernization program. In June 2017, the VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department's approach to modernizing VistA. Specifically, rather than continue to use VistA, the Secretary stated that the department plans to acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is implementing. In this regard, DOD has contracted with the Cerner Corporation to provide a new integrated electronic health record system. According to the Secretary, VA has chosen to acquire this same product because it would allow all of VA's and DOD's patient data to reside in one system, thus enabling seamless care between the department and DOD without the manual and electronic exchange and reconciliation of data between two separate systems. VA expects to award a contract to Cerner in early 2018, and deployment of the new system is anticipated to begin 18 months after the contract has been signed. VA obligated approximately $1.1 billion for contracts with 138 different contractors during fiscal years 2011 through 2016. Specifically, the department obligated approximately $224 million and $880 million, respectively, for contracts associated with these efforts. Of the 138 contractors, 34 performed work supporting both, iEHR and VistA Evolution. The remaining 104 contractors worked exclusively on either iEHR or VistA Evolution. Funding for the 34 contractors that worked on both iEHR and VistA Evolution totaled about $793 million of the $1.1 billion obligated for contracts on the two initiatives. Of the $741 million obligated to the key contractors, $411 million (about 55 percent) was obligated for contracts supporting the development of new system capabilities, $256 million (about 35 percent) was obligated for contracts supporting project management activities, and $74 million (about 10 percent) was obligated for contracts supporting operations and maintenance for iEHR and VistA Evolution. VA obligated funds to all 15 of the key contractors for system development, 13 of the key contractors for project management, and 12 of the key contractors for operations and maintenance. VA recently announced a new VistA modernization initiative, which is intended to guide the transition from VistA Evolution to EHRM. However, the department is still early in its efforts, pending the contract award. In this regard, the department has begun developing plans that are intended to guide the new EHRM program. For example, the department has developed a preliminary description of the organizations that are to be responsible for governing the",

This report examines (1) challenges NIST faces in providing measurement services and supporting documentary standards development, and (2) NIST's efforts to address these challenges. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed NIST officials, stakeholders, and agency standards executives. GAO also conducted focus groups with NIST staff and stakeholders in five technology areas selected based on the breadth of U.S. industry and the number of standards development organizations (SDO) that develop standards. What GAO Found The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) faces challenges in providing measurement services and supporting documentary-standards development, based on GAO's literature review, NIST stakeholder focus groups, and interviews with stakeholders and agency officials. First, the breadth of U.S. industry and the number of SDOs, among other factors, make identifying and prioritizing measurement service and standards needs challenging. Second, ensuring adequate U.S. representation in international standards activities can be challenging due to the number of activities and other factors. Third, the involvement of multiple agencies and interdisciplinary issues makes coordinating among federal agencies on documentary standards challenging. NIST works to address the challenges it faces in providing measurement services and supporting documentary-standards development in a variety of ways, but opportunities exist to improve some efforts. First, NIST's efforts help address challenges to identifying and prioritizing needs, but some efforts do not fully align with federal guidance or NIST policy. Second, NIST's efforts help support U.S. representation in international standards organizations but may not fully implement its role and address the challenge it faces. Third, NIST's efforts support federal agency coordination on standards issues but do not fully align with selected leading collaboration practices. For example, NIST's efforts to support U.S. representation in international standards activities do not fully align with selected leading practices for enhancing and sustaining interagency collaboration. For example, the ICSP charter has not been updated since it was signed in October 2000. Further, the ICSP may not include relevant members to carry out its functions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NIST (1) develop a mechanism to identify and respond to circumstances when U.S. representation at international SDOs may be inadequate and (2) update the ICSP charter to reflect the 2016 revisions to Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. NIST generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-241": "Why GAO Did This Study The WTP is the largest and most technically complex cleanup project managed by DOE. In 2012, DOE learned that it could not verify that engineering, procurement, and construction at the WTP met nuclear safety and quality requirements. In response, DOE directed the contractor to implement quality assurance corrective measures to ensure that problems would be identified and prevented from recurring. GAO was asked to review DOE's quality assurance program. This report examines (1) actions DOE has taken to identify and address quality assurance problems at the WTP and (2) the extent to which DOE has ensured that all quality assurance problems have been identified and that problems have recurring. GAO reviewed DOE documents and interviewed DOE officials and quality assurance experts. GAO also interviewed DOE officials and quality assurance experts. What GAO Found The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of the Secretary of Energy's (Operation) Office of the Secretary of Energy's (ORP) Office of the Secretary of Energy's (OSE) Quality Assurance Division (ORP) has taken several actions to identify and address quality assurance problems at the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). In 2013, ORP conducted a comprehensive audit, which resulted in several actions, including when the office had the contractor begin implementing a Managed Improvement Plan (MIP) in 2014. The MIP is intended to ensure that the WTP could operate in compliance with DOE-approved safety and quality requirements. Implementation of the MIP was to be completed by April 2016. Although the contractor reported that the implementation was complete, some of the plan's corrective measures have not been fully implemented, according to contractor documents and quality assurance experts GAO spoke with. In addition, ORP's effort to verify the extent to which the contractor has implemented MIP corrective measures is not scheduled to be complete until at least December 2018. According to DOE documents and ORP quality assurance experts GAO spoke with, ORP's actions have not ensured that all quality assurance problems have been identified at the WTP, and some previously identified problems are recurring. Specifically, according to DOE documents and experts GAO spoke with, ORP's oversight has not ensured that the contractor has identified all quality assurance problems in structures, systems, and components that were completed and installed before the 2012 work stoppage or identified all such problems in newer structures, systems, and components needed for initial WTP operations. In addition, according to the documents GAO reviewed and experts GAO interviewed, previously identified quality assurance problems are recurring. Specifically, according to the documents GAO reviewed and experts GAO spoke with, ORP oversight has not ensured that the contractor has identified all quality assurance problems in structures, systems, and components that were completed and installed before the 2012 work stoppage or identified all such problems in newer structures, systems, and components needed for initial WTP operations. In addition, according to the documents GAO reviewed and experts GAO interviewed, previously identified quality assurance problems are recurring. Specifically, according to the documents GAO reviewed and experts GAO spoke with, ORP oversight has not ensured that the contractor has identified all quality assurance problems in structures, systems, and components that were completed and installed before the 2012 work stoppage or identified all such problems in newer structures, systems, and components needed for initial WTP operations. In addition, according to the documents GAO reviewed and experts GAO interviewed, previously identified quality assurance problems are recurring. A 2017 assessment from DOE headquarters and GAO interviews with nine ORP quality assurance experts suggest that ORP's organizational structure does not provide the quality assurance function with sufficient independence from upper management\u2014which includes the ORP Manager and the WTP Federal Project Director\u2014to effectively oversee the contractor's quality assurance program. GAO's prior work has found that to be independent, an oversight organization should be structurally distinct and separate from program offices responsible for achieving the program's mission to avoid management interference or conflict between program office mission objectives and safety. At ORP, however, the Quality Assurance Division is not fully separate and independent from the upper management of the WTP project, which manages cost and schedule performance. GAO believes that such a structure has the potential to create a conflict of interest. Specifically, GAO found that ORP's Quality Assurance Division performs assessments of the contractor's quality assurance program, among other things, and reports its findings to ORP upper management, including the ORP Manager, who has the discretion to determine whether and to what extent to require the contractor to take action in response to findings. When quality assurance issues are identified, ORP upper management must balance its mission of meeting cost and schedule targets with its responsibility to ensure that nuclear safety and quality standards are met. However, these are two potentially conflicting responsibilities because meeting WTP cost and schedule targets may be threatened if",
    "gao_GAO-18-189T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates more than 3,000 medical facilities and a total of about 1.4 million people in outpatient and inpatient care. VA has a large inventory of facilities and services that are underutilized, outdated, or underutilized. In 2005, Congress enacted the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round to review the status of VA's facilities and services. This testimony discusses (1) factors that affect VA's efforts to align its facilities and services, (2) key elements and challenges that affected DOD's 2005 BRAC round, and (3) key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report, VA: Facility Alignment Is Challenged by Shifting Veterans' Populations, Evolving Care Standards, Aging Infrastructure, and Limited Stakeholder Involvement, GAO-17-23. What GAO Found Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect VA's efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect VA's efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, there has been a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care. This shift will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. In addition, VA has not consistently followed best practices for effectively engaging stakeholders. VA may align its facilities to meet veterans' needs by expanding or consolidating facilities or services. Stakeholders\u2014including veterans; local, state, and federal officials; Veterans Service Organizations; historic preservation groups; VA staff; and Congress\u2014sometimes view changes as working against their interests or those of their constituents, especially when services are eliminated or shifted from one location to another. GAO found that VA has not consistently engaged with stakeholders, and, in some cases, this inconsistency resulted in adversarial relationships that reduced VA's ability to better align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. In April 2017, GAO recommended that VA improve stakeholder communication guidance and evaluate its efforts. VA agreed with GAO's recommendations and outlined a plan to implement them. VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP) processes have limitations. VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects system-wide, but SCIP's limitations\u2014including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information\u2014undermine VA's ability to achieve its goals. For example, the time between when planning officials at VA medical facilities begin developing the SCIP narratives and when they are notified that a project is funded has taken between 17 and 23 months over the past 6 fiscal-year's SCIP submissions. As such, VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their project submissions from the previous year have been funded. As such, VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their project submissions from the previous year have been funded. Although VA acknowledges many of these limitations, it has taken little action in response. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should evaluate and determine appropriate corrective action for identified limitations on a timely basis. If VA does not address known limitations with the SCIP process, it will not have reasonable assurance that SCIP can be used to accurately identify the capital necessary to address VA's service and infrastructure gaps. In April 2017, GAO recommended that VA address identified limitations to the SCIP process, including limitations to scoring and approval, and access to information. VA concurred with the recommendation to the extent the limitations were within its control. While VA has taken some actions, the recommendation remains open. Key elements and challenges affecting DOD's 2005 BRAC round could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. For example, the Secretary of Defense emphasized the importance of transforming the military to make it more efficient as part of the 2005 BRAC round. Other goals for the 2005 BRAC process included fostering jointness among the four military services, reducing excess infrastructure, and producing savings. DOD developed and used the Cost of Base Realignment Actions (COBRA) model, a quantitative tool that DOD has used since the 1988 BRAC round to provide consistency in potential cost, savings, and return-on-investment estimates",
    "gao_GAO-18-661T": "Why GAO Did This Study VA is responsible for deciding veterans' eligibility for disability compensation. VA's current process is based on a decision by the Board of Veterans' Affairs (Board) on a veteran's initial claim. The Act of 2017 made changes to VA's process that will generally take effect no earlier than February 2019, which is approximately 18 months after enactment. GAO was asked to testify on its March 2018 report on VA's implementation of the Act. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which VA has addressed GAO's recommendations on VA's planning for disability appeals reform, and (2) the extent to which VA has addressed GAO's recommendations on VA's planning for disability appeals reform. This statement is based on GAO's March 2018 report, which examined VA's appeals plan and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found In its March 2018 report, GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could help ensure successful implementation of its disability appeals reform by addressing gaps in its planning. GAO recommended four actions that VA should take: (1) address all legally required elements required by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017; (2) articulate how it will monitor and assess the performance of the new appeals process compared to the legacy process; (3) augment its master schedule to manage the project; and (4) address risk more fully. VA has taken steps in response to all four, but has not fully addressed GAO's recommendations. For example, VA's November 2017 plan for implementing a new disability appeals process while attending to appeals under way in the current (legacy) process addressed most, but not all, elements required by the Act. For the five remaining elements, it partially addressed 4 elements related to monitoring implementation, projecting productivity, and workforce planning, and did not address 1 element related to identifying total resources. VA's updated plan, however, continues to only partially address 3 elements related to monitoring implementation and workforce planning, and now addresses the 1 element related to delineating the total resources. Until VA's appeals plan provides complete information on all required elements, Congress may not have the information needed to conduct oversight of the agency's efforts to implement and administer the new process while addressing legacy appeals. VA has partially addressed GAO's recommendations to measure, monitor, and assess performance on a range of key dimensions of success. Specifically, the plan had not (1) established timeliness goals for two of the three Board options (i.e., Board review of additional evidence without a hearing and Board review of additional evidence with a hearing); (2) articulated additional aspects of performance important for managing appeals, such as accuracy of decisions, veteran satisfaction with the process, or cost; (3) provided important details about what aspects of the new appeals' performance would be compared to what aspects of the legacy process' performance; or (4) explained how the agency would monitor whether resources are being appropriately devoted to both the new and legacy appeals processes and how it will track both sets of workloads. VA's updated plan also identified elements of a high-quality and reliable implementation schedule that were missing from VA's master schedule for appeals reform. Specifically, GAO reported that VA's master schedule\u2014which the agency included with its November 2017 plan\u2014did not (1) include all key activities; (2) show which activities must finish prior to the start of other activities, or the amount of time an activity could be delayed before the delay affects VA's estimated implementation date; (3) reflect interim goals and milestones for monitoring implementation; or (4) assign resources for activities. GAO recommended that VA augment the master schedule for VA's appeals plan to reflect all activities\u2014such as modifications to IT systems\u2014as well as assigned responsibilities, interdependencies, start and end dates for key activities for each workgroup, and resources. These steps establish accountability and reduce overall risk of implementation failures. In its updated plans, VA took steps to develop interim goals and milestones for monitoring implementation, among other positive actions, but the master schedule still included gaps in sound practices for project management. Specifically, the updated master schedule does not include all key activities; show which activities must finish prior to the start of other activities, or the amount of time an activity could be delayed before the delay affects VA's estimated implementation date; (3) reflect interim goals and milestones for monitoring implementation; or (4) assign resources for activities. These steps establish accountability and reduce overall risk of implementation failures. In its updated plans, VA took steps to develop interim goals and milestones for monitoring implementation, among other positive actions, but the master schedule still included gaps in sound practices for project management.

    "gao_GAO-18-454": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard operates 10 major acquisition programs, including the HC-130J, the Polar Star, and the 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters. The Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio includes 10 surface, aviation, and command and control programs. GAO has previously reported on shortcomings in the Coast Guard's management of its acquisition portfolio. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's management of its acquisition portfolio. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard has made changes to how it manages its acquisition portfolio and (2) how the Coast Guard is sustaining existing assets until new assets become operational. GAO reviewed the Coast Guard's 5-year Capital Investment Plan (CIP) and analyzed the extent to which the Coast Guard has changed how it manages its acquisition portfolio. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The Coast Guard's 5-year CIP, a congressionally mandated report, does not fully reflect cost realities or acquisition needs. For example, the most recent CIP\u2014from fiscal years 2018 through 2022\u2014projects funding for its portfolio of major acquisitions that, over the 5-year period, exceeds average budget requests in the last several years. As such, GAO found that the Coast Guard continues to face the same programmatic risks that annual CIP-based planning perpetuates, similar to what GAO has been reporting since 2011. To address funding constraints, the Coast Guard has been in a reactive mode by making prioritization decisions through the annual budget process without identifying how trade-off decisions made in the current budget cycle will affect the future of the acquisition portfolio. As a result of this planning process, and as GAO found in 2012 and in this current review, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability gaps unaddressed that could affect future operations. Moreover, the Coast Guard has not conducted portfolio-wide oversight through its cross-directorate groups. The Coast Guard has a management body in place to conduct oversight of its major acquisition programs; however, this management body has not conducted oversight across the entire acquisition portfolio from a collective approach. Among the Coast Guard's three cross-directorate groups, the Executive Oversight Council is positioned to oversee the portfolio collectively and has the potential to implement key portfolio-wide management practices, including conducting formal reviews and issuing reports. However, this council has not conducted these portfolio-wide reviews. Without collective portfolio reviews at the senior management level, the Coast Guard does not have sufficient information to determine needed trade-offs between the major acquisition programs while also considering the affordability of the portfolio and budget realities. The Coast Guard is extending the service lives of certain legacy assets as sustainment costs and other risks are increasing. For example, according to Coast Guard officials, they plan to operate H-65 and H-60 helicopters to flight hours beyond what has been flown for those aircraft. In addition, several of the Coast Guard's aging cutters have spent more on depot-level maintenance than was planned. Combined, these cutters\u2014the 210-foot and 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters, the icebreaker Polar Star, and Inland Tenders\u2014expended in excess of $460 million more than what was originally estimated (standard support levels) from 2010 to 2017. When combined with the challenges facing the acquisition portfolio, the Coast Guard will likely struggle to pay for the maintenance of older assets, a situation that could lead to deferred maintenance and lost operational capability. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Coast Guard work with Congress to include in its annual 5-year CIP a discussion of the acquisition programs it prioritized that describes how trade-off decisions made could affect other acquisition programs, such as by delaying recapitalization efforts or needing to conduct Service Life Extension Projects for legacy assets. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-209": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars annually to acquire new weapon systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses a variety of approaches to manage its acquisition programs, including a process known as the defense acquisition process. GAO was asked to review the workforce size, composition, and mix of selected DOD acquisition programs. This report examines (1) factors that affect the workforce size, composition, and mix of selected DOD acquisition programs, and (2) the personnel costs for selected DOD acquisition programs. GAO reviewed DOD budget requests for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 associated with the 11 selected programs, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found Several interrelated factors influenced the workforce size, composition, and mix, as well as the organizational structure of the 11 selected DOD acquisition programs GAO reviewed. GAO found the following: Program workforce size and composition were influenced by the degree to which the program assumed responsibility for technical development and integration, as well as the program's stage within the acquisition life cycle. Program workforce mix varied depending on the use of contractor personnel, which was based on the workload requirements and the availability of government personnel to provide the skills needed. Programs were generally structured as either stand-alone--new, high priority, complex weapon system platforms with dedicated personnel--or as part of a portfolio of related programs to share personnel across programs. The personnel costs for each major defense acquisition program GAO reviewed are included in different parts of the President's annual budget request, including budget justification documents, but are not always clearly identifiable due to different approaches used to report such costs. The DOD Financial Management Regulation gives the military departments flexibility in how they submit program personnel costs. For example, it suggests the use of \"typical\" personnel cost categories for research, development, test, and evaluation programs to include in their individual program budget exhibits, but it also allows the departments to use the personnel cost categories they deem to be the most appropriate when formulating the budget request. In reviewing DOD's budget requests for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 associated with the 11 selected programs, GAO found that personnel costs are budgeted for in two main ways--centrally by the military department, or by an individual program. Personnel costs that are program-funded are included in individual program budget justification requests, whereas personnel costs that are centrally funded by the military departments are aggregated into one or more line items in the military department's specific appropriation request. Personnel costs that are program-funded are included in individual program budget justification requests, whereas personnel costs that are centrally funded by the military departments are aggregated into one or more line items in the military department's specific appropriation request. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments that GAO incorporated into this report as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-682": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has recognized 573 Indian tribes as distinct, independent political communities with inherent powers of a limited sovereignty, which has never been extinguished. Tribes can vary significantly in regard to their size, population, and ownership status of land. The National Broadband Plan stated in 2010 that tribes needed substantially greater financial support than was available to them at the time and that accelerating tribal broadband deployment would require increased funding. The National Congress of American Indians expressed concerns that the needs for federally funded broadband projects are greater on tribal lands but tribes do not receive the appropriate share of federal funding aimed at increasing broadband deployment. GAO was asked to review broadband deployment on tribal lands. This report discusses (1) examples of partnership arrangements that tribal entities have used to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands and the outcomes of those partnerships, (2) the amount of funding provided to tribal entities for broadband deployment from key federal programs, and (3) stakeholder-identified barriers that tribal entities face in obtaining federal funding for broadband deployment and the extent to which federal agencies have taken action to address those barriers. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, federal programs, and agency documents and interviewed agency officials, tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned broadband providers. What GAO Found GAO identified seven examples of partnership arrangements between tribes and other entities to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands using prior authorized funding, based on GAO's review. These arrangements are not being used under currently available programs. As previously noted, there are greater costs associated with deploying broadband on unserved tribal lands because the unserved areas are generally rural, with possibly rugged terrain, and have low population densities. Because of these greater costs, there may be little to no private sector incentive to deploy broadband or enter into a partnership arrangement to do so. During GAO's review, GAO did not find any partnership arrangements that leveraged currently available federal funding from the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Connect America Fund or the Rural Utilities Service's Community Connect Program. Among these examples, tribes partnered with several different types of entities that were eligible to receive federal grants, including (1) private providers; (2) a community access network provider; (3) an electric cooperative; (4) a regional consortium; and (5) tribally owned telecommunications companies (which GAO will refer to as tribally owned providers). These types of arrangements are explained below. Outcomes of these partnership arrangements varied, as reported by tribal officials and other stakeholders GAO interviewed, but these stakeholders did not always agree on the outcomes. FCC and RUS are the primary sources of federal funding to deploy broadband infrastructure in rural and remote areas where the cost of providing service is high, including tribal lands. GAO found that less than 1 percent of FCC funding and about 14 percent of RUS funding went directly to tribes and tribally owned providers. Combined, FCC and RUS funding totaled $34.6 billion during that time period and tribes and tribally owned providers received $235 million, or about 0.7 percent. Stakeholders GAO interviewed cited several barriers that tribes may face when seeking federal funding for broadband deployment. The two primary barriers these interviewees cited were (1) the statutory requirement for eligible telecommunications carriers (ETC) designation and (2) grant application requirements. The two primary barriers these interviewees cited were (1) the statutory requirement for ETC designation and (2) grant application requirements. The Broadband Opportunity Council, established in March 2015, recognized the need for federal agencies to reduce the barriers that are impeding broadband deployment. However, RUS has not taken steps to identify or address the barriers tribes face when applying for RUS grant funding. By identifying and addressing any regulatory barriers that impede tribal entities' access to RUS funding, RUS could help tribes obtain funding to expand broadband deployment on tribal lands. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Administrator of RUS to undertake an assessment to identify any regulatory barriers that may unduly impede efforts by tribes to obtain RUS federal grant funds for broadband deployment on tribal lands and implement any steps necessary to address the identified barriers. FCC and RUS provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate; NTIA did not have any comments.",

The President's budget requests for the Corps included $12.9 billion for fiscal years 2008 through 2017. GAO was asked to review the Corps' construction program. This report examines (1) the number of construction projects included in the President's budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, (2) the extent to which the Corps prioritizes construction projects to recommend for inclusion in the President's budget requests, and (3) the extent to which the Corps prioritizes construction projects. GAO analyzed Corps budget data for fiscal years 2008 through 2017; reviewed Corps budget guidance; and interviewed Corps officials. What GAO Found For fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the President's budget requests for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) included 164 construction projects located in 31 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The five states for which the most funds were requested in this period were: Florida, with $2.4 billion requested for 15 construction projects, Illinois, with $2.3 billion requested for 15 construction projects, California, with $1.6 billion requested for 24 construction projects, Washington, with $924 million requested for 9 construction projects, Kentucky, with $646 million requested for 6 construction projects. The projects in these five states accounted for 61 percent of the $12.9 billion that the President requested for Corps construction projects in these years. To prioritize construction projects to recommend for inclusion in the President's budget requests for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the Corps used a multi-level process involving the three levels of its organization--districts, divisions, and headquarters. Districts prepare work packages for ranking. Corps officials divide projects into work packages, which can be considered for inclusion in the budget. Corps guidance instructed district officials to assign priority levels based on criteria including whether a project is new or continuing and where a work package falls within a project's overall work plan. Corps officials said they routinely revised the criteria while developing the annual budget guidance, for reasons such as addressing changes in the policy guidance from the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works or the Office of Management and Budget, or improving the ranking process. Corps officials said they developed the final budget recommendations for each fiscal year, including a recommended funding amount for each project, with input from various levels of the organization. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-19-49": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends more than $90 billion annually on IT. The Chief Information Officers (CIO) are responsible for ensuring that the department-level CIO has the authority to make IT budget decisions. The act requires CIOs to have a significant role in all IT-related planning, programming, budgeting, and execution decisions. GAO was asked to review the implementation of FITARA. This report examines the extent to which selected federal agencies (1) established policies and procedures in place that address the IT budgeting requirements of FITARA and related OMB guidance, (2) could demonstrate that they had developed fiscal year 2017 IT budgets for sampled investments consistent with FITARA and OMB guidance, and (3) implemented processes to ensure that annual IT budgets are informed by reliable cost information. GAO reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 16 investments from four departments\u2014DOE, HHS, Treasury, and DOJ\u2014based on the largest fiscal year 2017 IT budget request. GAO also interviewed officials from the four departments and their respective component agencies. What GAO Found The four departments GAO reviewed\u2014the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2014had taken steps to establish policies and procedures that addressed the eight common baseline requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for CIOs. However, most of the departments, or their component agencies, lacked comprehensive policies and procedures that fully addressed all of the requirements. Specifically, of the eight common baseline requirements that GAO reviewed, all four departments and their respective component agencies had fully documented one requirement in their policies and procedures, and either had partially documented or had not documented the other seven requirements. While shortfalls existed for each department, DOJ had the most comprehensive IT budgeting policies and procedures, followed by Treasury, HHS, and DOE, respectively. In addition, department CIOs at Treasury, HHS, and DOE had delegated many of the responsibilities for addressing the IT budgeting requirements to component CIOs\u2014thus, these component agencies were to supplement their departments' policies and procedures with their own IT budgeting policies and procedures for the responsibilities they were delegated. Among the three respective component agencies to which Treasury, HHS, and DOE had delegated responsibilities, the extent to which the components had documented requirements in their policies and procedures varied. For example, IRS had documented policies and procedures for all four of its delegated requirements. In addition, CMS had documented policies and procedures that satisfied two, partially satisfied two, and did not satisfy one of the five requirements delegated to that component. For its part, NNSA had not documented any of its five delegated requirements in the component's policies and procedures. Until the departments establish policies and procedures that address all requirements, they risk inconsistently applying requirements that are key to providing CIOs visibility into IT resources, input to resource plans, and meaningful review and approval of IT budgets. In addition, the lack of policies and procedures has hampered the departments' ability to demonstrate their implementation of the common baseline requirements for their investments. While DOJ fully demonstrated implementation for the selected requirements for the majority of the investments GAO sampled, HHS and Treasury partially demonstrated implementation for a majority of their investments, and DOE had not demonstrated implementation for the majority of its investments. As a result, departments were not always able to show that these CIOs had adequate input to resource plans and review of their IT budgets. Without retaining supporting documentation to show how common baseline requirements have been addressed on individual investments, the departments will be challenged in consistently demonstrating that CIOs are sufficiently involved in planning and budgeting annual IT expenditures. Finally, the four departments lacked quality assurance processes for ensuring their IT budgets are informed by reliable cost information. This resulted in billions of dollars that were requested without departments having comprehensive information to support those requests. Among other things, this was due to a lack of processes for periodically reviewing data quality and estimation methods for government labor estimates, as well as a lack of processes to cross-walk IT spending data in their procurement and accounting systems with investment data in their IT portfolio management systems. The Administration's new approach for obtaining additional granularity on department IT investment spending, when implemented, should provide departments and CIOs with enhanced visibility into IT costs across the portfolio and additional assurance that the budget is being informed by all relevant IT costs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB and departments take action to address gaps in their FITARA plans, document the actions taken to comply with OMB's guidance, and implement key quality assurance processes. OMB and the departments agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-425": "Why GAO Did This Study The passage of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments (Title IX) has increased the number of boys and girls participating in interscholastic sports. However, a significant gap remains between boys and girls in public high school sports. GAO was asked to examine (1) what measures public high schools and athletics administrators have taken to encourage equal athletic opportunities for boys and girls, and (2) what factors affect boys' and girls' participation levels in public high school sports programs. GAO surveyed athletics administrators at a generalizable sample of public high schools in the United States, and interviewed officials from Education, subject matter specialists, and athletics administrators. GAO also interviewed subject matter specialists and athletics administrators from eight states. What GAO Found The majority of public high schools assessed some aspects of their sports programs over the past 2 years to encourage equal opportunities for boys' and girls' sports teams, according to GAO's nationally generalizable survey of athletics administrators. Specifically, the estimated percentage of schools assessing key athletic resources provided to these teams ranged from 63 percent of schools assessing travel opportunities to 76 percent assessing uniforms. Athletics administrators reported that they paid attention to the actual resources girls and boys received rather than focusing on expenditures, and three of these administrators explained there could be valid reasons for spending differences. In addition, some schools recently took steps to gauge student interest in specific sports as a means of encouraging equal opportunities, according to GAO's survey. For example, 40 percent of schools surveyed students about their sports interests over the last 2 school years and 25 percent added or changed their sports offerings based on requests from the underrepresented sex in their school's sports program. An estimated 31 percent of schools had not recently used any of these tools, or did not know if they had used them, to gauge student interest. GAO estimates that 40 percent of athletics administrators were unaware of or unsupported by their Title IX coordinator, and an additional 12 percent were unaware of their Title IX coordinator but received little to no support from them. GAO's survey results raise questions as to whether Title IX coordinators\u2014whom school districts must designate and make visible in accordance with Title IX regulations\u2014are familiar with and using the Office of Civil Rights' (OCR) guidance on their role and responsibilities. This guidance states that the Title IX coordinator should support and work closely with members of the school community, including athletics administrators, to ensure compliance with Title IX. However, GAO's survey results raise questions as to whether Title IX coordinators\u2014whom school districts must designate and make visible in accordance with Title IX regulations\u2014are familiar with and using OCR's guidance on their role and responsibilities. This guidance states that the Title IX coordinator should support and work closely with members of the school community, including athletics administrators, to ensure compliance with Title IX. GAO's survey results suggest that the number of and interest in opportunities schools offered, as well as student interest in those opportunities and in working with specific coaches at the school, were top factors that encouraged interscholastic sports participation among public high school students. GAO estimates that over 70 percent of athletics administrators viewed the number of interscholastic athletic participation opportunities at their school as encouraging boys and girls to participate in high school sports. GAO also found that the most frequently cited factors that were perceived to discourage participation (representing an estimated 15-35 percent of athletic administrators) were (1) competing responsibilities, (2) lack of access to athletic feeder programs, (3) the perceived benefits of joining club teams, and (4) participation costs to the student. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Education determine the extent to which Title IX coordinators at the K-12 level are aware of and using the tools recommended in OCR's existing guidance and any barriers preventing their use of this guidance, and use this information in its efforts to encourage them to work with athletics administrators on ensuring equal athletic opportunities. Education partially concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-32": "Why GAO Did This Study The opioid crisis has increased the number of infants diagnosed with NAS, a condition that can result from the prenatal use of opioids by pregnant women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that NAS can cause a number of complications, including respiratory distress. GAO was asked to review the treatment of NAS. This report examines (1) the extent to which infants with NAS are treated in hospital settings, (2) the recommended practices and challenges for addressing NAS, and (3) the extent to which HHS has developed a strategy related to addressing NAS. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from HHS, stakeholders, and experts. GAO also reviewed HHS's Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy, which includes 39 recommendations related to addressing NAS. GAO interviewed officials from HHS, stakeholders, and experts in four states selected based on their high incidence of NAS, among other things. GAO also reviewed HHS's Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy and relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found Most infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are treated in various hospital settings, and in selected states Medicaid pays for NAS treatment services using a bundle of services. According to the literature GAO reviewed, most infants with NAS in the United States are treated in a hospital setting, often in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which has a relatively high daily cost of care. Stakeholders GAO interviewed and the literature GAO reviewed suggested that some of these infants may be transferred to a non-hospital setting to complete pharmacologic treatment and continue non-pharmacologic treatment. HHS officials told GAO that there is not a comprehensive list of facilities that may treat infants with NAS outside of the hospital. Based on information from stakeholders GAO interviewed and the literature GAO reviewed, GAO identified two types of non-hospital settings available in certain states that treat infants with NAS: (1) outpatient clinics and programs and (2) neonatal withdrawal centers. Stakeholders GAO interviewed and the literature GAO reviewed suggested that the costs of treating infants with NAS in non-hospital settings were lower than treating them in hospital settings. However, supporting data and research of the costs in different settings are anecdotal or otherwise limited. For example, health care providers from one of the hospitals GAO visited in Vermont told GAO that their hospital is the only one in the state that allows infants with NAS to complete pharmacologic treatment through the Vermont outpatient clinic because they have established the necessary infrastructure to ensure families' compliance and safe practices at home. Stakeholders GAO interviewed and the literature GAO reviewed identified several recommended practices for addressing NAS\u2014that is, treating women with opioid use disorders during pregnancy or treating infants diagnosed with NAS after birth. The most frequently recommended practices were (1) prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment, such as allowing the mother to reside with the infant during treatment, to facilitate the mother-infant bond; (2) educating mothers on prenatal care, treatment for NAS, and available resources for after an infant's discharge; (3) educating health care providers on the stigma faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy and on how to screen for and treat NAS; and (4) using a protocol in a hospital or non-hospital setting for screening and treating infants with NAS. Stakeholders GAO interviewed and the literature GAO reviewed identified several challenges health care providers face in their efforts to address NAS. The most frequently cited challenges included (1) the use of multiple substances by pregnant women, which can exacerbate NAS; (2) the stigma faced by women who use opioids during pregnancy, which may affect whether they seek prenatal care to address NAS, among other things; (3) hospital staff burden and limited physical capacity to care for infants with NAS; (4) limited coordination of care for mothers and infants with NAS; and (5) gaps in research and data on NAS. HHS recently published a strategy with key recommendations that have the potential to address some of the challenges related to treating NAS. However, HHS lacks a sound plan for implementing these recommendations. The absence of such planning raises questions about whether and when HHS will be able to implement these recommendations in a timely manner and be able to assess its progress. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HHS develop a plan to implement the NAS-related recommendations identified in the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-12": "Why GAO Did This Study Meat and poultry workers are exposed to the same types of hazards as plant employees, such as musculoskeletal disorders, which can cause musculoskeletal disorders. In 1994, after a workplace fire in 1991 that killed 25 poultry workers in North Carolina, OSHA and FSIS signed an MOU on worker safety and health at meat and poultry plants. The MOU outlines the policies and procedures the agencies agreed to use, including a process for FSIS to refer serious hazards facing plant workers or FSIS inspectors to OSHA, plans for OSHA and FSIS to develop and implement training for FSIS staff in hazard recognition, and an agreement to coordinate standards development and exchange information on matters of common concern. GAO was asked to review worker safety and health at meat and poultry plants. This report (1) describes the efforts OSHA has made to help ensure meat and poultry workers' safety and health, and assesses what, if any, challenges OSHA faces in carrying out these efforts; (2) examines how OSHA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have collaborated to help ensure meat and poultry worker safety and health; and (3) assesses any factors that may affect OSHA and FSIS efforts to protect meat and poultry workers from chemical hazards. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed federal officials, worker advocates, and plant workers in five states selected based on factors such as high production of meat and poultry. What GAO Found The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has increased its annual inspections of the meat and poultry slaughter and processing industry since 2005, but faces challenges identifying worker concerns. OSHA inspections increased from 177 in 2005 to 244 in 2016, due primarily to an increase in poultry inspections. OSHA officials said that all inspections decreased in 2013 partly due to the federal government shutdown that year. OSHA also provided compliance assistance to small and medium-sized businesses. OSHA faces challenges identifying and addressing worker safety and health concerns because workers may be reluctant to speak with inspectors, according to workers GAO interviewed in four states, as well as worker advocates. Workers GAO interviewed in all five states said they fear dismissal or other punishment if they complain to OSHA or their state Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSH) agency about their workplace concerns, such as sustaining injuries or being discouraged from using the bathroom. Workers GAO interviewed in all five states said that bathroom access is a concern, and worker advocates GAO interviewed stated it was as well, but it is possible that OSHA is missing instances of this hazard, resulting in incomplete data to guide its inspections. Gathering additional information about whether meat and poultry workers experience delayed or denied access to bathrooms could help OSHA determine the extent of the problem and be better positioned to protect worker safety and health. OSHA and FSIS's main vehicle for collaboration on worker safety and health is their 1994 memorandum of understanding (MOU), but efforts to implement and evaluate this agreement have been limited. The MOU outlines the policies and procedures the agencies agreed to use, including (1) a process for FSIS inspectors to refer serious workplace hazards facing plant workers or FSIS inspectors to OSHA, (2) plans for OSHA and FSIS to develop and implement training for FSIS staff in hazard recognition, and (3) an agreement to coordinate standards development and exchange information on matters of common concern. In 2005, GAO found that agency efforts to implement this MOU had lapsed, and GAO recommended that the two agencies revisit and update certain aspects of their MOU. OSHA and FSIS have taken some steps to implement the policies and procedures outlined in the MOU, but GAO found issues with the MOU's implementation in these three areas, hampering achievement of the MOU's goals. Further, OSHA and FSIS have not evaluated the implementation of the MOU. Federal reviews of certain antimicrobial chemicals before they are used in meat and poultry plants leave gaps with respect to worker safety and health. FSIS inspectors and workers in meat and poultry plants are exposed to antimicrobial chemicals every day, as they are commonly used during all work shifts, both on animal and bird carcasses and on work surfaces and machinery. In general, the potential for chemical exposure is greater for plant workers than for FSIS inspectors. According to officials GAO spoke with at various plants, plant workers handle these chemicals by receiving shipments, opening containers, and filling machines with the chemical, among other ways, while FSIS inspectors are generally not present at various times that workers are using the chemical, most notably, when the plant is being cleaned between shifts. Depending on a chemical's intended use, it may or may not undergo a federal review of",
    "gao_GAO-18-113": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's current fighter aircraft fleet is comprised of both legacy and new aircraft. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are acquiring and fielding new aircraft, and some of these legacy aircraft are confronted with sustainment challenges that affect their availability. GAO was asked to review the fighter pilot workforce. This report examines (1) the extent to which the military services had differences in the number of fighter pilots compared to authorizations, as well as contributing factors and service initiatives to address the differences, and (2) the extent to which the military services have reevaluated squadron requirements for the number of fighter pilots needed, including the consideration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platforms. GAO analyzed Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps fighter pilot staffing levels and authorizations for fiscal years 2006 through 2017, and Navy and Marine Corps retention data for fiscal years 2011 through 2017. GAO also interviewed service officials and fighter pilots. What GAO Found According to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps data, each military service had fewer fighter pilots than authorizations (i.e., funded positions) from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The magnitude of these gaps has grown since fiscal year 2006 and is projected to continue through at least fiscal year 2023. The Navy had fewer fighter pilots than authorizations in fiscal years 2013 through 2017. According to service officials, because of low numbers of fighter pilots, the military services are unable to staff all operational fighter pilot positions. According to the military services, deploying squadrons have been fully staffed with fighter pilots, due to staffing approaches that include extending deployments and augmenting deployed squadrons with fighter pilots from other squadrons. Service officials identified multiple factors that have led to low numbers of fighter pilots, including challenges in training and retaining fighter pilots. To increase fighter pilot numbers, the military services are taking a variety of actions. The Air Force has developed and implemented initiatives to help increase fighter pilot numbers, and the Navy and the Marine Corps are developing initiatives to address overall retention concerns. The Air Force established a dedicated team to identify and develop initiatives specifically to address its reported fighter pilot shortage, and this effort has resulted in over 35 implemented initiatives. The Navy and the Marine Corps are developing initiatives to address overall retention concerns. The Air Force established a dedicated team to identify and develop initiatives specifically to address its reported fighter pilot shortage, and this effort has resulted in over 35 implemented initiatives. The Navy and the Marine Corps have not formulated initiatives specifically for fighter pilots, but have identified actions to address retention concerns. The Air Force established a dedicated team to identify and develop initiatives specifically to address its reported fighter pilot shortage, and this effort has resulted in over 35 implemented initiatives. The Navy and the Marine Corps have not formulated initiatives specifically for fighter pilots, but have identified actions to address retention concerns. The Air Force has not reevaluated squadron requirements to reflect changing conditions, increased workload, and emerging UAS requirements. Air Force officials told GAO that changing conditions in fighter squadrons, such as a higher pace of changes to tactics and technology, increased training requirements, and more frequent individual deployments, have increased fighter pilot workload. However, the Marine Corps has not updated squadron requirements to reflect such changes. Specifically, Marine Corps fighter pilot squadron requirements are outlined in four fighter squadron staffing documents, and as of November 2017, none had been updated within the last 2 years. The Air Force and Navy officials told GAO that their military services have not conducted an assessment of the impact of future UAS operations on fighter pilot requirements. Without steps by the military services, to include reevaluating workload and taking into account the impact that the planned use of UAS will have on the fighter pilot workforce, the military services will not fully know the extent and nature of gaps between fighter pilot numbers and authorizations and how to best target actions to address these gaps. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Air Force reevaluate fighter pilot squadron requirements, including updating current assumptions of fighter pilot workload, and assessing the impact of future UAS operations on fighter pilot requirements. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-522": "Why GAO Did This Study FINRA is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) that regulates the securities market. FINRA is regulated by SEC and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC's oversight of FINRA includes program inspections, oversight examinations, and thematic oversight examinations. GAO was asked to review SEC's oversight of FINRA. This report (1) determines if SEC's oversight of FINRA included the 10 areas specified in Section 964 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), (2) evaluates the extent to which selected SEC internal guidance on conducting examinations of FINRA follows generally accepted government auditing standards, and (3) evaluates the extent to which examinations of FINRA's governance practices followed SEC's internal guidance. GAO reviewed documentation for all examinations since fiscal year 2015 (from October 2014 through April 2018) that SEC staff identified as relating to Section 964. GAO also interviewed SEC staff and reviewed relevant SEC guidance. What GAO Found Since fiscal year 2015, SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) has completed at least one examination covering all 10 areas specified in Section 964 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). GAO determined that FSIO completed at least one examination covering each of the Section 964 areas since fiscal year 2015. In total, FSIO began or completed 61 examinations (program inspections, oversight examinations, and thematic oversight examinations) related to FINRA programs and operations in that period. Some examinations evaluated other aspects of FINRA's programs and operations (those not specifically identified in Section 964), such as market surveillance and restitution for harmed investors. FSIO examinations most frequently covered FINRA examinations (41 of 61). Nearly all of the oversight examinations reviewed at least some aspect of FINRA examinations. GAO found that OCIE policies and procedures used for examining FINRA since fiscal year 2015 generally were consistent with the requirements of generally accepted government auditing standards. SEC uses an examination manual to conduct its self-regulatory organization (SRO) examinations. GAO previously found that OCIE policies and procedures (including the prior version of the manual) generally were consistent with the requirements of the auditing standards that GAO determined were most relevant to assessing examination policies and procedures: independence, competence, quality control and assurance, planning, supervision, evidence, documentation, and reporting. GAO compared the current and prior versions of the examination manual to the most relevant requirements from the section of the manual related to planning inspections and the most relevant requirements from the section of the manual related to communicating inspection findings to determine if OCIE conducted the inspections in accordance with its guidance. GAO found that all five inspections GAO reviewed met all requirements applicable to that particular inspection. For example, across all the inspections, OCIE examiners held prefieldwork meetings and documented and received approval for the scope of the examinations. Additionally, all five inspections met the required 180-day completion deadline and closed the inspection with a disposition letter. In cases in which requirements were not applicable, the reasons generally were that a triggering event had not occurred and no further action was needed. For instance, the scope was not modified in any of the inspections, so the requirement for approval of such modifications did not apply. Furthermore, none of the inspections included non-National Examination Program staff (such as personnel from SEC's Enforcement Division), and so requirements surrounding participation by those groups did not apply. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. SEC concurred with GAO's findings and provided technical comments on the draft report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-408T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions, including marine safety, which include enforcing laws to prevent death, injury, and property loss in the marine environment. The Coast Guard has developed goals and targets to assess and communicate agency performance. The Coast Guard's performance assessment process also includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. This statement discusses (1) actions the Coast Guard could take to improve data quality and (2) actions the Coast Guard could take to improve the transparency of its data used for reporting on its mission performance and planning. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports on the Coast Guard's mission performance and planning. GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found GAO previously reported on actions the Coast Guard could take to ensure that, among other things, it addresses limitations posed by incomplete data, the use of unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations with its performance goal data, for more effective program management. For example, GAO found that the Coast Guard could improve completeness of mission data. In December 2017, GAO found that several different federal agencies play a role in overseeing and promoting commercial fishing vessel safety, including the Coast Guard. As part of its marine safety activities, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations, including those involving commercial fishing vessels, which are part of an industry with one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States. However, GAO could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery\u2014meaning the area in which a certain type of fish (e.g., shrimp, salmon, crab) is caught\u2014because the Coast Guard's data are not complete. Further, GAO was unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities because reliable data on certain information needed to do so\u2014including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates\u2014are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Having this information could be useful to carrying out the Coast Guard's marine safety mission, which includes enforcing laws to prevent death, injury, and property loss in the marine environment. GAO recommended that the Coast Guard incorporate field unit input, such as information on assets' actual performance, to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation, and in February 2018 informed GAO that it plans to address this recommendation through changes to two process documents that are under revision, with an expected completion date in March 2018. Improve performance goal data. In October 2017, GAO found that the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identified limitations with two of the seven selected performance goals GAO reviewed, including the five year average number of recreational boating deaths and injuries. GAO recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents, as needed, based on the results of the assessment. The Coast Guard concurred and in February 2018, informed GAO that it had taken initial actions to address GAO's recommendation. However, GAO's preliminary review of these actions indicates that further action will be needed to fully address GAO's recommendation, such as documenting and reporting the limitations of performance data. Improve transparency of data for reporting on its mission performance and planning. In October 2017, GAO found that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011 due to a previous DHS leadership decision. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. For example, one of the Coast Guard's missions\u2014defense readiness\u2014has no goals that are publicly reported or shared with Congress, even though measures related to defense readiness are included in the Coast Guard's APR. Coast Guard officials stated that they could see the benefit of publicly releasing their APR; however, DHS's decision to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly has so far deterred the Coast Guard from pursuing the public release of its APR. Improve capital planning transparency. In its previous reports, GAO found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan (CIP) does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs that are made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made several recommendations in recent years intended to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult tradeoff decisions it will likely face. The Coast Guard generally concurred with these recommendations and is in various stages of implementation. For example, in 2014 GAO recommended the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the",
    "gao_GAO-19-175": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies have a variety of firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment available to their officers to support their law enforcement missions. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' spending on firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment. This report examines (1) available data show about spending on firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment made by federal agencies with 250 or more federal law enforcement officers from fiscal years 2010 through 2017; (2) to what extent selected agencies accurately reported purchases of firearms and ammunition in publicly-available data on USASpending.gov; (3) what types and quantities of firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment do the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have documented to be in their inventory systems, as of November 2017; and (4) what inventory controls and procedures are in place at HHS, EPA, and IRS, and to what extent these agencies follow these procedures at selected locations. GAO reviewed spending data from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 for 20 agencies with 250 or more federal law enforcement officers (FLEOs) and 5 agency components. GAO also interviewed agency officials and reviewed documents from these agencies. What GAO Found Available data show that 20 federal agencies reported spending at least $1.5 billion on firearms, ammunition, and selected tactical equipment from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. These agencies reported spending at least $38.8 million on firearms, $325.9 million on ammunition, and $1.14 billion on tactical equipment\u2014at least $1.5 billion in total\u2014from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. These agencies reported spending at least $38.8 million on firearms, $325.9 million on ammunition, and $1.14 billion on tactical equipment\u2014at least $1.5 billion in total\u2014from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. The amount each agency reported spending on firearms over the 8-year period ranged from $106,000 to $4 million at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The quantity of firearms each agency reported buying over the 8-year period ranged from 311 at SSA OIG to 8,500 at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The amount each agency reported spending on ammunition over the 8-year period ranged from $309,000 to $128 million. The amount each agency reported spending on tactical equipment over the 8-year period ranged from $10,000 to $609 million. For the three agencies GAO reviewed\u2014the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Forest Service, and ICE\u2014publicly available purchase data from USASpending.gov on firearms and ammunition did not consistently match the internal agency data GAO reviewed. For example, ICE did not properly identify the funding agency in USASpending.gov for purchases where other DHS agencies used ICE contracts to procure firearms and ammunition. This inflated its publicly-available data to show a significantly higher obligated dollar value of purchases than it actually purchased. Because ICE does not accurately report the agency that funded the purchase to USASpending.gov, the public does not have accurate information on how much ICE and the agencies that make purchases using ICE contracting services have obligated for firearms and ammunition. Improving the accuracy of the reported funding agency can better help the public understand and use federal purchase data, and increase accountability and transparency for these sensitive purchases. Case study components GAO reviewed have inventory controls in place for firearms, ammunition, and tactical equipment. Components generally followed their procedures at selected locations to track and secure FLEOs' firearms. In addition, all 12 case study components' offices that GAO visited were in compliance with their ammunition and tactical equipment inventory controls. All components had some controls governing ammunition and equipment, though the specific controls varied by component. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that ICE update its contracting process to include the name of the appropriate funding agency in data entered into USASpending.gov for firearms and ammunition purchases. ICE concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-297": "Why GAO Did This Study The recent housing crisis has raised concerns about the affordability of home equity. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) required GAO to report on the effects of federal homeownership assistance programs on home equity building. This report describes (1) how federal homeownership assistance programs affect home equity building, and (2) options, including private-sector mortgage products, through which borrowers can accelerate home equity building and the trade-offs of these options for both borrowers and lenders. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and agency program policies and guidance; analyzed relevant literature; and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders, including academics, experts, and industry, including mortgage lenders and insurers, selected because they made proposals to increase homeownership or build home equity faster, wrote on homeownership issues, were recommended by government officials, or were involved in providing mortgage products designed to accelerate equity building. What GAO Found Existing federal homeownership assistance programs use features and mechanisms that can have equity-building effects, but the programs are not specifically designed to accelerate equity building. The programs can assist homeowners to build equity over time by providing access to homeownership, but the programs do not have an explicit focus on accelerating the ongoing pace of paying down the loan principal faster than a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Rather, the overall focus of the programs is on providing affordable access to homeownership, according to officials of relevant agencies and entities and based on their mission goals. For example, the goal of the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance program is to facilitate access to affordable mortgages for home buyers who might not otherwise be served by the private market. Federal and federally mandated programs that provide funding for grants and loans for down-payment assistance can have equity-building effects. Although accelerated equity building is not the policy goal of these programs, down-payment assistance can lower the barrier to homeownership for some lower-income home buyers so that the equity-building effects of homeownership can accrue. Borrowers have options to accelerate equity building that include obtaining shorter-term mortgages, making more frequent or additional payments, or choosing a mortgage product available in the private mortgage market designed to accelerate equity building. These options accelerate equity building by affecting the key components of a mortgage\u2014term (duration), down payment, interest rate, or payment frequency or amount. The advantages of building equity faster can include using home equity as a financial cushion in emergencies, like unexpected medical expenses. However, there are trade-offs to these options, such as higher monthly payments for shorter-term mortgages. Additionally, stakeholders identified key trade-offs and considerations in introducing new products and mechanisms for accelerating home equity building that could affect the success of the products or mechanisms. For example, the lack of a secondary market for accelerated equity-building mortgages could limit lenders' willingness to offer accelerated equity-building products. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-250": "Why GAO Did This Study BLM is responsible for overseeing oil and gas development on federal lands. BLM is required to reclaim orphaned wells that have no responsible or liable party and for which there is insufficient bond coverage for reclamation. BLM's 2012 well review policy directs field offices to review all shut-in wells at least once every 5 years and to ensure that shut-in wells no longer capable of producing oil or gas are reclaimed. GAO was asked to review BLM's management of its potential liabilities. This report examines (1) how BLM's actual costs incurred to reclaim orphaned wells and potential oil and gas well liabilities have changed, if at all, for fiscal years 2010 through 2017; (2) the extent to which BLM has implemented its 2012 well review and 2013 bond adequacy review policies; and (3) BLM officials' and stakeholders' views on what challenges, if any, BLM faces in managing its potential liabilities. GAO analyzed BLM's well review and bond adequacy review policies, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has likely increased its actual costs incurred to reclaim orphaned wells and potential oil and gas well liabilities for fiscal years 2010 through 2017. GAO's analysis of available information found that BLM's actual reclamation costs have likely increased since 2010. In addition, BLM does not systematically track the number of inactive wells, in particular those wells that are at high risk of becoming orphaned, or the information necessary to determine potential liabilities, such as the number of inactive wells and inactive wells over time. BLM headquarters officials said that they sometimes check the Automated Fluid Minerals Support System (AFMSS) to see how many orphaned wells there are, but without doing so systematically and recording the results of these checks, it is not possible to determine how the agency has been making progress in managing the number of orphaned wells. The extent to which BLM has implemented its well review policy and bond adequacy review policy is unclear. Specifically, GAO was unable to fully assess the extent to which BLM's field and state offices have implemented directives included in these policies because of inconsistent well review information, inaccurate well and bond data in AFMSS, and inadequate monitoring of well and bond policies' implementation. For example, BLM's well review policy directs field offices to review each shut-in well every 5 years. BLM's performance against this directive cannot be assessed without reliable information on when wells become shut-in and when well reviews are conducted. BLM headquarters has taken some actions to monitor the implementation of its well and bond adequacy review policies across the agency, but its efforts have been limited, and the agency cannot ensure that its policy directives have been fully implemented. For example, BLM headquarters relies on national well review and bond adequacy review reports to monitor the extent to which field offices are conducting well and bond adequacy reviews. However, these reports have data limitations and do not consistently record a field office's progress in meeting the policies overall. Without taking actions to strengthen its approach to monitoring, such as collecting and analyzing data on performance indicators and ensuring the quality of those data, BLM's ability to assess the extent to which field offices are reviewing all inactive wells and determining the adequacy of all bonds is limited. According to BLM officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed, BLM faces several challenges in managing its potential oil and gas well liabilities. In particular, BLM officials and stakeholders told GAO that one challenge in managing BLM's potential liabilities is identifying and managing shut-in wells and preventing them from becoming orphaned. Another challenge identified was limited resources and competing priorities in reclaiming orphaned wells. BLM officials and stakeholders cited additional challenges, including BLM's ability to review nationwide bonds, minimum bond amounts, and operator unresponsiveness. For example, officials from one BLM state office expressed concerns about operators with multiple wells covered by the minimum bond amounts, which the officials believed to be inadequate to cover total potential reclamation costs.

    "gao_GAO-19-229": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO was asked to review the Navy's efforts to reduce maintenance delays. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Navy has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet, (2) the extent to which the Navy has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays, and (3) the extent to which the Navy has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed Navy maintenance data from fiscal years 2008 through 2018, and interviewed Navy officials and shipyard officials. GAO also visited three of the four public shipyards that conduct attack submarine repair work. What GAO Found The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and the end of fiscal year 2018, attack submarines will have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. GAO's analysis found that the primary driver affecting attack submarines are delays in completing depot maintenance. GAO also found that the Navy incurs significant costs in operating and supporting submarines that are experiencing maintenance delays and idle time. GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and on those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. While acknowledging the magnitude of these costs, Navy officials stated that there may be some benefits that could be realized from these operating and support costs since crews on idle attack submarines can conduct some limited training. The Navy has begun to address some challenges associated with attack submarine maintenance delays but has not effectively allocated maintenance periods to limit idle time. GAO reported in September 2017 that the Navy projected an inability to support 50 planned submarine maintenance periods over the ensuing 23 years, due to capacity and capability shortfalls at the public shipyards. GAO recommended that the Navy develop a comprehensive plan for shipyard capital investment. In February 2018 the Navy published its shipyard optimization plan, outlining an estimated $21 billion investment needed to address shipyard facility and equipment needs over 20 years to meet the operational needs of the current Navy fleet, but not the larger fleet size planned for the future. The Navy has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among the public and private shipyards to limit attack submarine idle time and maintenance delays. GAO estimates that, as a result of these backlogs, the Navy will incur approximately $266 million in operating and support costs in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars for idle submarines from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2023, as well as additional depot maintenance delays. The Navy may have options to mitigate idle time and maintenance delays. For example, officials at the private shipyards told GAO that they will have available capacity for repair work for at least the next 5 years. Although the Navy has shifted about 8 million man-hours in attack submarine maintenance to private shipyards over the past 5 years, it has done so sporadically, having decided to do so in some cases only after experiencing lengthy periods of idle time. According to private shipyard officials, the sporadic shifts in workload have resulted in repair workload gaps that have disrupted private shipyard workforce, performance, and capital investment\u2014creating costs that are ultimately borne in part by the Navy. GAO believes that the Navy has not fully mitigated this challenge because it has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, and to proactively minimize attack submarine idle time and maintenance delays. Such an analysis would help the Navy better assess private shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance and would help it incorporate a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks, including: the large operating and support costs of having attack submarines sitting idle; the qualitative benefits associated with providing additional availability to the combatant commanders; and the potential for additional work at private shipyards to reduce schedule risk to submarine construction programs by allowing the yards to build and maintain a stable shipyard workforce. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, and to proactively minimize attack submarine idle time and maintenance delays. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-380": "Why GAO Did This Study VHA is responsible for ensuring that veterans receive safe and effective care for opioid pain. VHA has established nine goals to help ensure that veterans are prescribed and used opioid pain medications in a safe and effective manner. GAO was asked to review VHA's opioid safety efforts. This report examines (1) VHA's progress on its goals and (2) the extent to which VHA providers adhere to these goals and the extent to which they are following key opioid risk mitigation strategies. GAO reviewed VHA policy, analyzed VHA data, and interviewed VHA officials. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 103 veterans prescribed opioids between March 2016 and March 2017. What GAO Found The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made progress on its Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) goals, but performance measurement limitations exist for some goals and certain CARA provisions have not been fully implemented. For example, VHA has not implemented two CARA requirements intended to improve opioid safety for veterans. First, VHA's Opioid Therapy Risk Report (OTRR) has the ability to determine whether a provider has prescribed opioids to a veteran without checking that veteran's information in the OTRR. Second, VHA has not implemented two CARA requirements intended to improve opioid safety for veterans. First, CARA requires that VHA's Opioid Therapy Risk Report (OTRR) have the ability to determine whether a provider has prescribed opioids to a veteran without checking that veteran's information in the OTRR. However, GAO found that VHA Central Office cannot track the extent to which VHA providers use OTRR because this tool does not have this tracking capability. Without this capability, VHA cannot sufficiently monitor whether providers are using the tool to help reduce the likelihood of opioid-related adverse events occurring among veterans receiving care through VHA. Second, VHA providers do not always adhere to required opioid risk mitigation strategies and guideline recommendations for prescribing opioids in a safe manner. GAO found that of the 53 veterans who received long-term opioid therapy, 32 received an annual urine drug screening, 13 veterans had their names queried in a state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), and 41 veterans had provided informed consent indicating that they had been educated on the risks and benefits of opioid use. GAO also found that some VHA providers at selected facilities do not consistently follow selected clinical practice guideline recommendations related to opioid safety. GAO found that 20 percent of veterans in GAO's sample were prescribed a non-pharmacological therapy, 23 percent were prescribed naloxone, 54 percent had appropriate maintenance follow-up visits with a provider while prescribed opioids, and 17 percent had appropriate follow-up visits with a provider after a change in their opioid prescription. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA (1) document the actions it takes towards achieving OSI goals, (2) track the use of OTRR, (3) ensure that all VISNs have implemented an academic detailing program, and (4) require VHA medical facilities to take steps to ensure provider adherence to opioid risk mitigation strategies. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",

    "gao_GAO-18-576T": "Why GAO Did This Study NASA is responsible for the nation's space flight programs, which include the Orion, SLS, and EGS. NASA's portfolio of major projects includes the following: Orion, SLS, and EGS; the Europa Clipper, Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope; the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope; the WFIRST project; and the SLS and EGS. This statement discusses (1) the cost and schedule performance of NASA's portfolio of major projects, (2) the extent of cost growth and schedule delays, and (3) the composition of the portfolio in the coming years. This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 assessment of NASA's portfolio of major projects and updated information from NASA on the status of GAO's 2017 assessment. What GAO Found The cost and schedule performance of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) portfolio of major projects deteriorated between May 2017 and May 2018, but the extent of cost growth is unknown. NASA lacks a current cost estimate for its Orion crew capsule\u2014one of the largest programs in the portfolio\u2014but expects the program will exceed its cost baseline when NASA updates the program's life-cycle cost estimate. Because the Orion program accounts for about 22 percent of all development costs, even a small percentage of cost growth for the Orion program could significantly affect portfolio cost performance. The known negative cost and schedule performance is largely driven by the cost and schedule growth of four projects\u2014SLS, EGS, Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) and Mars 2020\u2014that experienced technical problems compounded by programmatic challenges. Together, these projects experienced $638 million in cost growth and 59 months in aggregate schedule delays. Two projects\u2014JWST and ICESat-2\u2014experienced schedule delays due to technical challenges identified during integration and test. Another 3 projects\u2014NASA Indian Space Research Organisation Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR), ICON, and GRACE-FO\u2014experienced cost growth or delays largely due to factors outside of the projects' control, such as launch vehicle delays. The composition of the portfolio in the coming years is expected to include large and complex projects, putting NASA at risk of continued cost increases and schedule delays. Specifically, NASA plans to have complex projects enter the development portfolio in the next few years as it holds confirmation reviews and set cost and schedule baselines. This includes the Europa Clipper project and potentially the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) project. In February 2018, the President's 2019 Budget Request proposed canceling the WFIRST project due to the project's significant costs and higher priorities in the agency. However, the project may continue if funding is received. Together, preliminary estimates indicate that these two projects could cost as much as $7.8 billion. In addition, NASA expects to begin other large, complex projects like the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway\u2014currently being discussed as a space station or outpost in lunar orbit\u2014and a Europa Lander project in the coming years. To its credit, NASA recently took steps to put a process in place to control the costs of two projects while in formulation, which may prove useful if properly executed. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to NASA to improve acquisition management, including ensuring that NASA conducts adequate and ongoing assessments of risks for larger programs, estimating and forecasting costs for its largest projects, and implementing management tools. NASA has generally agreed and taken steps to implement a number of GAO recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-230": "Why GAO Did This Study Identity theft occurs when individuals' personal information is lost, stolen, or given away. Once exposed, individuals' information can be misused to commit identity theft, fraud, or inflict other types of harm. Identity theft occurs when individuals' personal information is used without authorization in an attempt to commit fraud or other crimes. GAO was asked to review options consumers can use to prevent or address the risks resulting from data breaches. This report examines (1) information and expert views about the effectiveness of options consumers can use to prevent or address the risks resulting from data breaches; and (2) federal assistance available to help consumers understand these options, including the status of one matter for congressional consideration and one recommendation relating to these issues in GAO's 2017 report. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed representatives of academic, consumer, government, and industry experts. GAO also reviewed federal guidance and consumer education materials and interviewed representatives from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). What GAO Found Limited information is available on the effectiveness of options consumers can use to prevent or address the risks resulting from data breaches. GAO did not identify any studies that analyzed whether consumers who sign up for or purchase identity theft services encounter fewer instances of identity theft or detect instances of financial or other fraud more\u2014or less\u2014rapidly than consumers who take steps on their own. Views of experts varied, but most said identity theft services have limitations and would not address all data breach risks. Most experts also said that a credit freeze, which consumers place on their own for free, is a useful way to prevent one type of financial fraud\u2014the illegal opening of new credit accounts in consumers' names. Based on GAO's review and discussions with experts, consumers can consider four factors when deciding on options to address risks after a data breach: the extent to which an option might prevent fraud; the cost of an option; its convenience; and the type of information that was exposed and may be at risk. Among federal agencies, FTC serves as a primary source for free assistance (including online resources, educational outreach, and customized assistance through IdentityTheft.gov) to consumers on ways to respond to data breaches, identity theft, and related harm. Approximately 13 percent of those affected by the 2015 data breaches used credit and identity monitoring and identity restoration services that OPM offered them and a fraction of a percent made identity theft insurance claims (the payouts for which averaged $1,800). Data GAO assessed for this report support a 2017 recommendation GAO made to OMB and a matter for congressional consideration, both of which have not yet been implemented. In its March 2017 report, GAO found that OMB policy guidance for federal agencies on how to prepare for and respond to data breaches did not address how agencies might assess the effectiveness of identity theft services relative to lower-cost alternatives. GAO concluded that the guidance might not fully reflect the most useful and cost-effective options agencies should consider in response to a breach\u2014contrary to OMB's risk-management and internal control guidance calling on federal leaders to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, GAO recommended that OMB conduct an analysis of the effectiveness of identity theft services relative to alternatives, and revise its guidance to federal agencies in light of the analysis. In oral comments on a draft of the 2017 report, staff from OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs said that GAO's draft recommendation to OMB on expanding OMB's guidance to federal agencies would benefit from greater specificity, and GAO revised this recommendation to provide greater clarity. GAO contacted OMB several times between May 2018 and early March 2019 to update the status of this recommendation but as of March 2019, OMB had not responded with an update. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB conduct an analysis of the effectiveness of identity theft services relative to alternatives, and revise its guidance to federal agencies in light of the analysis. OMB generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-352": "Why GAO Did This Study VA is responsible for deciding veterans' eligibility for disability compensation. VA's current process, which is referred to as the legacy process, is a lengthy process that requires veterans to submit additional evidence to the Board of Veterans' Affairs (VBA) to determine whether the veteran is entitled to compensation. The 2017 Act requires VA to develop a comprehensive plan for processing veterans' disability claims. The Act also requires GAO to assess VA's plan against required elements. This report assesses the extent to which VA's plan addresses the required elements in the Act. GAO reviewed VA's plan and supplemental materials, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) appeals plan addresses 17 of the 22 required elements in the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Act), partially addresses 4 related to monitoring implementation and workforce planning, and does not address 1 element related to identifying total resources. VA's appeals plan reflects certain sound planning practices, such as convening a working group on performance tracking; however, the plan could improve its planning practices related to monitoring and assessing performance on a range of key dimensions of success. For example, VA's plan outlines timeliness goals for the two Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) options (average processing time of 125 days) and for the Board option that does not include new evidence or a hearing (average processing time of 365 days). However, VA's plan does not articulate a set of goals and measures that cover all aspects of its new appeals process, such as accuracy of decisions and cost. VA's plan also does not provide details on the metrics the agency will develop, how it will assess if the new appeals process is an improvement over the legacy process, and how it will monitor the allocation of resources between legacy and new appeals claims. VA's appeals plan reflects certain aspects of sound planning practices related to managing the implementation of process change; however, other key components are not addressed. For example, VA's appeals plan includes an assessment of risks associated with implementing the new appeals process, but could more comprehensively reflect key risks posed by such a significant reform effort. For example, VA's plan does not clearly define success criteria for RAMP, and it does not articulate how it will assess RAMP before proceeding with full implementation. Until VA addresses key risks associated with fully implementing appeals reform\u2014by either testing or conducting sensitivity analyses for all five appeals options, to better understand potential workloads at the Board\u2014VA runs the risk of fully implementing the process without knowing if it is improving the process for veterans. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA address all 22 required elements in its appeals plan, develop a high-quality and reliable implementation schedule, and assess risks associated with fully implementing the new appeals process. VA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-298": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS relies on IT to support its mission of providing America's taxpayers with top quality service. In fiscal year 2016, the agency spent approximately $2.7 billion on its IT investments. GAO was asked to review IRS's IT investments. This report examines (1) the performance of selected IRS IT investments, (2) any risks associated with selected legacy systems and evaluate the steps IRS has taken to manage them, and (3) the extent to which IRS has implemented key IT workforce planning practices. GAO selected four investments based on the number of IRS business areas and associated services, among other factors. GAO analyzed IRS's fiscal year 2016 performance data, interviewed agency officials, and reviewed documentation on the performance of these investments. What GAO Found The performance of selected Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information technology (IT) investments has varied. In this regard, GAO found that the four selected investments in development had spent less than planned, and that most were behind schedule and had delivered less scope than planned. In addition most of these investments had significant variances, meaning that actual cost, schedule, or scope varied from plans by more than 10 percent. For the five selected investments in the operations and maintenance phase, GAO found that most had met all of their operational performance targets and all performed operational analyses required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). However, none of the analyses addressed all key factors specified in OMB's guidance. Until IRS addresses the shortcomings noted for the selected operational investments, the agency risks not having critical information needed to determine whether the investments fully meet intended objectives and whether there are alternative ways to efficiently meet the agency's mission. Three selected investments GAO reviewed\u2014IMF, IDRS, and MSSS\u2014are facing significant risks due to their reliance on legacy programming languages, outdated hardware, and a shortage of human resources with critical skills. However, IRS has not implemented steps needed to effectively manage these risks\u2014and thus, the agency's ability to carry out its tax processing and modernization efforts may be impacted. Specifically, IRS reported that it experienced attrition of developers skilled in legacy programming languages and tax processing, exposing the investment to increased risks of not being able to successfully process tax information. IRS has not fully implemented all of the key practices for managing risks for any of the three selected legacy investments that GAO reviewed. Specifically, based on GAO's analysis, the agency fully implemented one key practice and partially implemented the remaining five for IMF; fully implemented two key practices, partially implemented two, and did not implement the remaining two for IDRS; fully implemented one key practice, partially implemented three, and did not implement the remaining two for MSSS. Until IRS fully implements all of the key practices for managing risks, it will be challenged to successfully identify and mitigate risks before they adversely impact the agency's ability to carry out its mission. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS fully implement the key practices for managing risks for selected legacy investments. IRS did not state whether it agreed or disagreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-679": "Why GAO Did This Study TCS programs provide scholarships to students from low-income families to help fund education. TCS programs are state programs, and the amount of tax credits donors can claim depends on the amount of the donation. GAO was asked to review TCS program donations. This report examines (1) how TCS programs determine student eligibility and consider factors when setting scholarship award amounts, (2) the effect of TCS program donations on the amount that donors owe in state and federal taxes, and (3) the extent to which TCS program donations can affect federal tax liabilities. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed TCS program data; and interviewed officials from the 22 TCS programs. GAO also reviewed relevant literature, such as the 2012-2016 5-year American Community Survey, and interviewed officials from 16 TCS programs. What GAO Found Most of the 22 TCS programs use income to determine student eligibility and consider various factors when setting scholarship award amounts. Seventeen of the 22 TCS programs have income limits (i.e., the maximum amount of household income a student can have and still be eligible for a scholarship). Six of the 17 programs have household income limits above their state's median income. Of the remaining five TCS programs that do not use income to determine eligibility, three use one or more other types of eligibility criteria, such as whether the student has a disability, and two\u2014Montana's TCS program and Arizona's Original Individual Income Tax Credit program\u2014are open to all school-aged residents. The extent to which TCS program donations affect the amount that donors owe in state and federal taxes depends on program characteristics\u2014such as the percentage of the donation that the rules of the program allow donors to claim as a state tax credit (referred to in this report as \u201ctax credit percentages\u201d) and limits on donation amounts\u2014along with donors' financial circumstances. Almost all of the TCS programs (20 of 22) offer tax credits to businesses for income or other types of taxes, while more than half offer tax credits to individuals for their income taxes (13 of 22). More than half of programs (13 of 22) offer tax credits for cash donations only, while the remaining 9 programs also allow for at least one type of \u201cin kind\u201d donation, such as a property donation. In addition to reducing their state tax liabilities, some individuals who make TCS program donations may also be able to reduce their federal income tax liabilities through the federal tax deduction for charitable contributions. In August 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of the Treasury published proposed regulations that, if finalized without modification, would change the extent to which individuals who make TCS program donations can reduce their federal tax liability. However, the proposed regulations were not final at the time this report was published and are therefore subject to change. As a result, the information GAO presents below does not address the proposed regulations. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",

    "gao_GAO-19-73": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's real property portfolio includes over 568,000 facilities with an estimated combined plant replacement value of about $1 trillion. DOD uses this information to determine facility sustainment funding and to understand DOD's utilization of its real property as a means to identify potential excess property for disposal. GAO was asked to review DOD's real property management. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's real property data are accurate and complete, (2) the extent to which DOD's processes for recording and reporting real property data are consistent, and (3) the extent to which DOD has addressed risks to its ability to use its real property information to manage its real property. GAO analyzed DOD's real property data from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and interviewed DOD, military service, and WHS officials. GAO also visited 12 installations selected based on size and location. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) real property asset database contained inaccurate data and lacked completeness, although certain data GAO reviewed improved since fiscal year 2014. Accuracy of data elements and completeness of the dataset are important to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), other federal agencies, and Congress because they use this information to determine facility sustainment funding and to understand DOD's utilization of its real property as a means to identify potential excess property for disposal. GAO found that accuracy of certain data in the selected set of key data elements improved while other data contained discrepancies that resulted in inaccuracies in the dataset for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. For example, the percentage of facilities with a review date older than 5 years improved from 34.1 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 22.1 percent in fiscal year 2016. RPAD did not include all of DOD's existing real property assets in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, resulting in an incomplete data set. Specifically, GAO found (1) the military services have not recorded all assets that existed and reflected previously disposed facilities that no longer existed as active in their respective data systems, (2) the military services did not report all assets in the RPAD submission to OSD that were recorded in each military service's data system, and (3) OSD did not include all assets reported by the military services in RPAD. GAO and others found instances of facilities that existed that the military services did not record in their data systems and of disposed facilities that no longer existed but were still reflected as active in RPAD. DOD's processes for recording and reporting real property data have deficiencies that contribute to inaccuracies and incompleteness in the RPAD data. Specifically, GAO identified inconsistencies in the military services' recording of real property transactions and physical inventories of assets. In addition, GAO found the military services have not corrected identified discrepancies in their real property data reported to OSD in the annual RPAD submissions. For example, the military services have not corrected identified discrepancies in their data systems that are identified by OSD's verification and validation tool. Without taking actions to address these deficiencies, DOD will continue to have inaccurate and incomplete real property data and unreliable information in the RPAD. DOD has not addressed three risks\u2014unfilled real property positions to manage its data, lack of a department-wide approach to improving data quality, and a limited plan for the implementation of its expanded data platform\u2014that diminish its ability to use real property information to manage its real property. For example, GAO found that the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy completed various workforce plans that found they did not have a sufficiently sized workforce to adequately maintain their real property data. Despite the recognized needs, DOD has not outlined how it plans to overcome challenges related to unfilled positions. Without a department-wide approach to improving data, DOD is missing an opportunity to ensure that the information needed for effective decision making, such as budget decisions and oversight by Congress, is available to meet real property accountability and reporting objectives and to avoid inefficient and potentially costly workarounds, such as additional data calls to installations. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD develop a strategy that identifies and addresses risks to data quality and information accessibility. DOD concurred with four recommendations and partially concurred with three recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-224": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS has the authority to hold refunds for all taxpayers claiming Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) until February 15. IRS has not yet received W-2 data to verify wage information. IRS has not assessed the effectiveness of the refund hold on systemic verification. GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of systemic verification. This report assesses (1) IRS's performance in detecting fraud and noncompliance using systemic verification, and the Social Security Administration's (SSA) performance providing timely Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) data to IRS; and (2) the extent to which IRS analyzed the effectiveness of the refund hold on systemic verification as well as opportunities for IRS to apply systemic verification to other efforts to detect fraud and noncompliance. GAO analyzed IRS documents and data, reviewed IRS's preliminary analysis of the 2017 filing season, and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found By mid-February 2017, 2 weeks following the new W-2 filing deadline and about when the refund hold expired, IRS had received more than twice as many (over 214 million) W-2s than SSA provided at a similar time in 2016. Nevertheless, IRS did not have all W-2 data in time to conduct pre-refund checks of wages, withholding, and other information before issuing refunds, especially early in the filing season. Despite not having all W-2 data, IRS was able to identify and prevent some fraud and noncompliance before issuing refunds. IRS received and initially processed through systemic verification a total of about 35.1 million individual tax returns through February 14, representing nearly $200 billion in refunds. IRS also verified wage and other information for approximately 4.72 million (35 percent) of those returns filed and processed through February 14, representing $73.5 billion in refunds. However, IRS was unable to verify 7.79 million (58 percent) of these returns before it released refunds because W-2 data were unavailable. IRS officials stated that while verifying wage information is important, the complexity of determining EITC and ACTC eligibility remains a challenge. GAO reviewed IRS's systemic verification results and found that IRS improved its selections of potentially fraudulent returns with W-2 data contributing to its fraud filters. IRS officials stated that they did not collect data to track how many penalty notices IRS did or did not mail for late W-2 filings, nor the associated penalties IRS proposed to assess for 2015 and 2016. IRS's analyses of the refund hold are limited, hampering their usefulness for decision making and IRS has not explored additional uses of systemic verification. IRS officials examined the effectiveness of the refund hold by analyzing how systemic verification results differ under several hypothetical scenarios. For example, IRS could extend the refund hold date beyond February 15 when more W-2 data are available for systemic verification before issuing refunds. IRS officials stated that they did not document an evaluation plan, include key data, determine how many refunds were issued before detecting potential fraud and noncompliance, nor assess taxpayer burden. Without a documented evaluation plan that includes key data to assess the success of preventing fraud and noncompliance before issuing refunds, IRS risks relying on insufficient information to make decisions on potential changes to the refund hold date and those subjected to it. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS (1) collect data to track late W-2 filing penalty notices and the extent to which they are associated with fraud and noncompliant returns; (2) develop an evaluation plan to fully assess the benefits and costs, including taxpayer burden, of modifying the refund hold; and (3) assess the benefits and costs of additional uses of W-2 data for pre-refund compliance checks, such as addressing underreporting, employment fraud, and other fraud or noncompliance. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-34": "Why GAO Did This Study VA operates one of the largest health care systems in the country. In 2016, VA launched the MSPV-NG program to standardize medical supplies used by medical centers. MSPV-NG requires medical centers to use a narrow formulary\u2014a list of specific items that medical centers are allowed to purchase. GAO was asked to review VA's implementation of MSPV-NG. This report addresses the extent to which (1) VA's implementation of MSPV-NG was effective in meeting program goals, and (2) VA awards contracts on an emergency basis for routine supplies and ongoing services, and what impact, if any, these awards have on VA's acquisition function. GAO reviewed VA's MSPV-NG program documents and interviewed VA officials and supply chain managers from four hospital networks. GAO also reviewed 18 emergency procurements from three selected Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and selected medical centers. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) implementation of the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program\u2014from its initial work to identify a list of supply requirements in 2015, through its roll-out of the formulary to medical centers in December 2016\u2014was not executed in line with leading practices. Despite changes aimed at improving implementation, the agency continues to face challenges that have precluded achievement of program goals. Specifically, VA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition that\u2014if in place\u2014could have facilitated buy-in for the change throughout the organization. Furthermore, the initial requirements development process and tight time frames contributed to ineffective contracting processes. As a result, VHA developed an initial formulary that did not meet the needs of the medical centers. VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the initial roll out, namely by increasing the level of clinical involvement. However, VHA has not yet achieved its goals for utilization and cost avoidance. VA is revising its approach to MSPV-NG requirements development to adopt a model that focuses on clinician-driven sourcing, a key step that leading hospital networks reported following in standardizing their medical supply chains. However, the program office has not outlined whether or how it will use input from national clinical program offices to prioritize its requirements development efforts. Without input from these national clinical program offices, VA will continue to be challenged to focus on supply categories that offer the best opportunity for standardization and cost avoidance. VA designated a substantial number of its procurements in fiscal year 2016 as emergencies, and GAO found that it frequently uses emergency procurements to buy routine supplies and on-going services that do not warrant the emergency designation defined in VHA guidance. Among the 18 contract actions GAO reviewed from three VISNs, GAO found instances of emergency procurements caused by shortcomings in planning, funding, and communication. These emergency procurements strain the capacity of VA's acquisition workforce and put the government at risk of paying more than it should for goods and services. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA (1) develop, document, and communicate to stakeholders an overarching strategy for the MSPV-NG program, including how the program office will prioritize categories of supplies for future phases of requirement development and contracting; (2) use input from national clinical program offices to prioritize its requirements development efforts beyond Phase 2; and (3) use input from national clinical program offices to prioritize its requirements development efforts beyond Phase 2. VA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-219": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2017 AICA cost share adjustment was enacted in January 2017. The AICA requires MEP centers to provide services to manufacturers that are aligned with the cost of providing services. The AICA also requires GAO to report on the impact of the cost share adjustment on MEP centers. This report describes (1) MEP centers' views regarding the extent to which the 2017 cost share adjustment has helped them serve manufacturers and (2) the extent to which NIST data show impacts of the cost share adjustment on centers' finances and activities. GAO surveyed all 51 MEP centers and interviewed officials from 9 MEP centers. GAO also reviewed NIST data on MEP centers' finances and activities. What GAO Found In response to GAO's survey, most Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) centers reported that the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) cost share adjustment has helped them serve manufacturers, but some center officials indicated that the impact is hard to measure. Specifically, most MEP centers GAO surveyed reported that the AICA's adjustment of the cost share to 1:1 for the life of a center's cooperative agreement has increased their financial stability and helped them serve very small and rural manufacturers. According to the survey results, centers run by nonprofit organizations reported greater impacts of the cost share adjustment than those run by states or universities. In follow-up interviews, some MEP center officials indicated that the impact is difficult to measure because of other recent changes that have also impacted their ability to serve manufacturers. GAO's analysis of NIST data indicates that there have been some changes in MEP centers' finances and activities since the 2017 AICA cost share adjustment. However, these changes generally began around the time NIST recompeted the centers' cooperative agreements, before the enactment of the AICA, and cannot necessarily be linked to the cost share adjustment. For example, the total number of manufacturers MEP centers reported serving increased from approximately 8,000 to 8,400, very small manufacturers MEP centers reported serving increased from approximately 2,600 to 2,700, and rural manufacturers MEP centers reported serving increased from approximately 1,500 to 1,600. NIST officials said that it may not be possible to separate the effects of the AICA cost share adjustment from the effects of the recompetition because of the lack of a link between the cost share adjustment and the recompetition. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-19-94": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends more than $25 billion annually for core mission support services, such as human resources (HR) and financial management. In fiscal year 2018, OMB and GSA introduced a new marketplace model for shared services that seeks to better meet the needs of customers and providers by offering more choices for purchasing shared services. GAO was asked to review the implementation of shared services. This report (1) identifies the progress and challenges associated with federal shared services initiatives for selected HR and financial management activities, and (2) assesses the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) and the General Service Administration's (GSA) actions to address those challenges. GAO reviewed relevant reports and interviewed agency officials and subject-matter experts. What GAO Found The federal government made progress toward establishing standards for selected financial management activities and designating providers to engage in a marketplace. However, information on outcomes is limited because data were not tracked amidst changes in the Financial Management Line of Business leadership and strategy. Specifically, OMB designated the General Services Administration's Financial Systems Integration Office as managing partner of the Financial Management Line of Business. OMB designated four shared services providers to provide financial management services to other agencies. However, information on outcomes is limited because data were not tracked amidst changes in the Financial Management Line of Business leadership and strategy. Wider adoption of HR and financial management shared services has been impeded by challenges in two areas. First, shared services efforts have faced persistent governance challenges, such as limited interagency collaboration, difficulty reconciling benefits and trade-offs, and limited oversight and technical support for shared services migrations. Second, the efforts have also experienced marketplace challenges, which involve difficulty obtaining funding to invest in shared services, demand uncertainty among providers, and limited choices for customers. These issues hampered efforts to establish effective and efficient shared services marketplaces. As a result, these marketplaces have not been able to consistently support sufficient competition limiting the potential cost sharing efficiencies and improved performance that could be realized with greater usage. OMB and GSA have taken actions to address these challenges, but could strengthen their implementation approach. OMB and GSA have a plan to monitor the implementation of an initiative designed to determine how well the new marketplace model works as intended. However, GAO found that OMB and GSA do not have a plan to monitor the implementation of an initiative designed to determine how well the new marketplace model works as intended. Nor have they identified and documented some key roles and responsibilities. The action plan also does not explain how OMB and GSA will provide information to customers about provider services, pricing, and performance. Lastly, OMB and GSA have not implemented a process for collecting and tracking cost-savings data. Until OMB and GSA finalize their plan for collecting the related data and evidence to measure their cost savings goal of an estimated $2 billion over 10 years, they will not be able to determine and report progress made. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB work with GSA to finalize a plan for monitoring the implementation of NewPay. OMB staff did not agree or disagree with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-278": "Why GAO Did This Study ARPA-E is a federal agency that is responsible for identifying and developing energy technology research gaps and developing programs to fill those gaps. ARPA-E is funded through a multi-stage process that includes reviewing applications for funding opportunities and negotiating the terms and conditions of awards. GAO was asked to review the review process. This report examines (1) the extent to which ARPA-E has assessed the department's financial assistance against the current administration's priorities, and (2) the impact of the review process on ARPA-E selectees. GAO reviewed ARPA-E funding announcements and award selections, and interviewed ARPA-E selectees. GAO also interviewed DOE Office of Management officials and 10 ARPA-E selectees selected based on their project size, technology readiness, and other factors. What GAO Found In 2017, the Department of Energy (DOE) developed and implemented a new review process to assess DOE financial assistance for new work against the current administration's priorities, including financial assistance for which ARPA-E had already made award selections. DOE reviewed and approved ARPA-E's opportunities for financial assistance on a rolling basis from May to September 2017, and nearly all were approved to proceed. The formal review of DOE financial assistance officially began on May 4, 2017, when DOE's Chief of Staff issued a memorandum stating that funding opportunity announcements and determinations of non-competitive financial assistance would be reviewed to ensure consistency with the administration's priorities. According to the memorandum, DOE agencies that award financial assistance\u2014referred to in this report as funding organizations\u2014were to provide information about each competitively selected funding announcement and determination of non-competitive financial assistance by May 15, 2017. This information included, for example, a brief description of the financial assistance, the number and amount of planned awards, and the technology readiness level of the projects being funded. DOE Office of Management officials told GAO that the agency's financial assistance review lasted through September 2017, as some DOE organizations continued to submit new financial assistance for review, but that the review was largely completed by August 10, 2017. However, while the formal review of DOE financial assistance began in May, award negotiations for ARPA-E-funded projects were suspended nearly 1 month earlier. Specifically, according to ARPA-E officials, DOE's Deputy Chief of Staff verbally directed ARPA-E on April 6, 2017 to stop all ongoing award negotiations. Specifically, according to ARPA-E officials, DOE's Deputy Chief of Staff verbally directed ARPA-E on April 6, 2017 to stop all ongoing award negotiations. According to the 10 ARPA-E selectees GAO interviewed, DOE's financial assistance review process created uncertainty, which led to a variety of impacts\u2014the most frequently cited impact of which were potentially delayed project timelines and difficulties staffing project teams. Selectees told GAO that they received little communication from ARPA-E during the review process, and they indicated that additional information about review timelines and potential effects on their awards would have helped them manage some of the uncertainty they experienced during the review process. DOE Office of Management officials said the fiscal year 2017 review process helped to better identify and coordinate future financial assistance department-wide on crosscutting issues. DOE is conducting the fiscal year 2018 review process prior to publicly issuing funding announcements. As a result, DOE Office of Management officials said, the delays and uncertainty that selectees experienced in fiscal year 2017 should be reduced.

    "gao_GAO-18-198": "Why GAO Did This Study Wireless networks play a critical role in providing communications to millions of Americans. However, the number of outages attributed to physical incidents has increased since 2009, and natural disasters have triggered the largest number of outages. GAO was asked to review federal agency and industry efforts to improve the resiliency of wireless networks in response to natural disasters and other physical incidents since Hurricane Sandy, a natural disaster that caused significant communications outages across several states in late 2012. This report examines (1) trends in wireless outages attributed to physical incidents since 2009 as reported to FCC, (2) the actions federal agencies and industry have taken since 2013 to improve wireless network resiliency, and (3) options that federal agencies could take to improve network resiliency and their advantages and disadvantages. GAO analyzed FCC data on wireless outages from 2009 through 2016 and interviewed federal agency and industry officials, as well as 24 stakeholders, including wireless carriers and other owners of wireless network infrastructure, industry associations, consumer groups, and state and local government officials. What GAO Found The number of wireless outages attributed to a physical incident increased from 2009 to 2016 (see figure). Specifically, the number of outages with a physical incident reported as a root cause increased from 189 outages in 2009 to 1,079 in 2016. The number of outages increased substantially during the first few years of this period and then was relatively stable, which mirrored the trend for all wireless outages. According to FCC officials, the increase in reported outages was due to increases in both the number of wireless customers and wireless infrastructure over this period, as well as due to FCC's outreach to wireless companies to clarify the thresholds for which carriers are required to report wireless outages to help ensure that carriers were consistently and fully reporting outages. From 2009 to 2016, about one-third of all wireless outages reported to FCC (6,002 of 18,325) were attributed to physical incidents. Of these outages, most were due to accidents, such as cable damage due to a backhoe cut, among other causes. Natural disasters\u2014including tornados and wildfires\u2014were the root cause for 25 percent of wireless outages attributed to a physical incident. Manmade events\u2014which include damage associated with theft or other intentional damage to facilities\u2014were the root cause for the remaining 1 percent of these outages. The number of wireless outages attributed to physical incidents increased from 2009 to 2016 in some states, including several of the most populous states such as California and Texas. The number of wireless outages attributed to physical incidents increased from 2009 to 2016 in some states, including several of the most populous states such as California and Texas. The number of wireless outages attributed to physical incidents increased from 2009 to 2016 in some states, including several of the most populous states such as California and Texas. The number of wireless outages attributed to physical incidents increased from 2009 to 2016 in some states, including several of the most populous states such as California and Texas. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have both continued to take action using a range of existing mechanisms to improve wireless network resiliency. These mechanisms include leading communications-specific planning activities and topic-specific research to develop and to share best practices. While these mechanisms are not new, FCC and DHS report updating and adapting these activities based on emerging needs and lessons learned from exercises and emergency events. FCC and DHS have also initiated some new activities to enhance wireless network resiliency since 2013. In April 2016, an industry coalition announced the Wireless Network Resiliency Cooperative Framework (framework), a voluntary initiative designed to advance wireless service continuity and information sharing during and after emergencies by enhancing coordination and communication, both among carriers and between carriers and government. The framework has five elements: some elements are specific to disaster response while other elements focus on preparedness and education. FCC has taken some steps to monitor the framework's implementation, such as developing a plan to track certain tasks related to the framework in August 2017. However, GAO found FCC's plan does not include any steps to document and assess the effect of the framework on the resiliency of wireless networks. In particular, FCC's plan does not track any outputs or outcomes over time that speak to the results of the framework, such as the number of roaming requests made and fulfilled during an emergency event. FCC officials said they have not discussed possible measures to monitor the effect of the framework with industry participants. By actively communicating information about the framework, FCC could increase the likelihood of receiving information from industry or state and local public-safety officials about any implementation issues or positive results from the framework. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FCC work with industry",
    "gao_GAO-18-136": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State) provide funding for democracy assistance programs. USAID provides democracy assistance through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, while NED provides democracy assistance only through grants. GAO was asked to review USAID's use of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements. This report examines (1) funding that USAID, NED, and State obligated for democracy assistance through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements; (2) USAID documentation of award-type decisions; and (3) comparisons USAID contracts with grants and cooperative agreements across selected award elements. GAO analyzed USAID, NED, and State funding data for fiscal years 2012 through 2016; reviewed USAID and State guidance; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found During fiscal years 2012 through 2016, USAID obligated $5.5 billion and NED obligated $610.2 million in democracy assistance funding, and the total such funding that State obligated cannot be reliably determined. USAID obligated more through contracts combined than contracts, but its obligations through different award types varied by fiscal year and Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) program area. NED provided democracy assistance only through grants, and its obligations remained generally constant by fiscal year but varied by DRG program area. State bureaus that were able to provide reliable data provided democracy assistance primarily through grants and cooperative agreements. GAO deemed data from these three bureaus unreliable because the data were incomplete, nonstandard, or inaccurate. USAID generally did not document award-type decisions in a complete and timely manner for the awards in GAO's sample. Specifically, USAID provided complete and timely documentation of the award-type decision for 5 of the 41 awards in GAO's sample. For the remaining 36 awards, the documentation was either incomplete, not timely, or both. USAID officials stated that they have introduced new processes and procedures, including making updates to relevant guidance, templates, and instructions that they believe will result in more timely and complete documentation of award-type decisions. However, USAID has not assessed whether these updates have resulted in more timely documentation of DRG award-type decisions. For the awards in GAO's sample, contracts generally differed from grants and cooperative agreements in terms of competition, scope of work, cost sharing and profit, and oversight requirements, among other characteristics. GAO identified differences in three award elements\u2014competition, cost sharing and profit, and oversight requirements\u2014that were generally consistent with the unique requirements provided for in procurement regulations and agency guidance. GAO also identified differences between the award types with regard to scope of work, and found certain activities were conducted under all three award types. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State and USAID identify and address factors that affect the reliability of their democracy assistance data, and that USAID assess whether current processes and procedures as outlined in revised guidance result in complete and timely documentation of award-type decisions. State and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-486": "Why GAO Did This Study The UI program provides cash benefits to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. In fiscal year 2017, the federal government made an estimated $1.36 billion in overpayments to UI claimants who failed to meet work search requirements. GAO was asked to review the UI program. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have implemented work search requirements, (2) the extent to which states have implemented work search requirements, and (3) the extent to which DOL monitors states' efforts to address work search overpayments. GAO analyzed DOL data on work search overpayments and state work search overpayment rates for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. GAO also interviewed DOL officials and state UI officials in six states selected based on a variety of factors, including the number of UI claims filed and the number of work search activities conducted. What GAO Found Based on GAO's analysis of Department of Labor (DOL) data, GAO found that certain state administrative practices, including investigating a higher percentage of claimant-reported work search activities and frequent use of formal warnings, were associated with lower reported state work search overpayment rates. However, DOL recently determined that federal law does not permit states to issue formal warnings instead of establishing that an overpayment was made. Additionally, a higher percentage of claimants required to search for work is associated with higher reported state work search overpayment rates. DOL officials told GAO in July 2017 they would soon issue a letter to states to inform them that they are no longer permitted to use formal warnings when they determine that claimants failed to meet work search requirements. However, DOL has not officially told states to stop using formal warnings. Without providing states with this information and monitoring their response, states will continue to report inconsistent information on the extent of work search overpayments. State work search overpayment rate estimates were higher for states where a higher proportion of claimants were required to search for work. For example, for every one percentage point increase in the fraction of cases with claimants required to search for work, there was a 0.084 percentage point increase in the work search overpayment rate estimate on average, all else being equal. DOL monitors states' work search overpayment rate estimates and provides assistance to help states address such overpayments, but lacks clear procedures on work search verification. DOL's Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) procedures direct states to investigate a sufficient number of work search contacts in its BAM sample of UI cases to determine if the claimants met the state's work search requirement. However, DOL has not provided states any additional direction on what is considered \"sufficient.\" Federal internal control standards state that agency management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve its objectives, including addressing related risks. By providing clear direction to states about work search verification requirements and monitoring states' implementation of these requirements, DOL would have greater assurance that states are complying with its requirements. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOL provide states with information about its determination that the use of formal warnings is no longer permissible under federal law, monitor states' efforts to discontinue the use of formal warnings, and monitor states' implementation of the clarified work search verification requirements. DOL agreed with all four recommendations and stated that it would take action to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-97": "Why GAO Did This Study The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible for regulating the safety of railroads at highway-rail grade crossings. FRA issued regulations in 2006 that required that train horns be sounded in advance of all public grade crossings. However, the regulations also provide an opportunity for public authorities to reduce the effects of noise associated with the train horn by establishing quiet zones. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act included provisions for GAO to review the effectiveness of FRA's final rule governing the use of train horns at highway-rail grade crossings. This report examines (1) what is known about the benefits and costs of quiet zones, (2) what challenges, if any, public authorities and others encounter in establishing quiet zones, and (3) how, if at all, FRA is evaluating the effectiveness of federal train horn regulations. GAO reviewed literature and FRA's regulations, interviewed FRA officials, and interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 40 stakeholders selected based on factors such as the number of new quiet zones and the number of grade crossings in new quiet zones. GAO also reviewed FRA's analyses of safety in quiet zones and interviewed FRA program officials. What GAO Found Benefits derived from establishing quiet zones and reducing noise from the train horn have not been quantified in research GAO reviewed or by the public authorities (i.e., communities) that GAO interviewed. Specifically, GAO's review of literature did not identify any studies that had quantified the benefits resulting from public authorities establishing quiet zones at grade crossings where the horn was previously sounded. Further, FRA has not quantified benefits associated with quiet zones, but did note in its final rule that quiet zones would likely result in localized quality-of-life benefits from silencing of the horn at locations where it had previously been sounded. Finally, none of the public authorities GAO interviewed have conducted any analysis that has quantified benefits associated with quiet zones or were aware of any studies that quantified these benefits. The costs to establish quiet zones depend on many factors, including the number of crossings in a quiet zone, the geography of the area in which the quiet zone is established, and the types of safety measures a public authority decides to install. FRA program officials and FRA guidance have stated that, in general, the factors that affect the costs include such things as the number of grade crossings in a quiet zone, the geography of the area in which the quiet zone is established, and the types of safety measures a public authority decides to install.

    "gao_GAO-18-477": "Why GAO Did This Study The SPR stores crude oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas. The SPR is intended to reduce the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products and to carry out obligations of the United States under the international energy program. The United States is expected to become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products by the late 2020s. Congress included a provision in law for GAO to review the SPR. This report examines (1) how the United States meets its IEA obligations and (2) the extent to which DOE has identified the optimal size for the SPR and the potential need for additional regional product reserves. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DOE officials and stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant studies and interviewed experts and stakeholders. What GAO Found Most International Energy Agency (IEA) members differ from the United States in two basic ways. Specifically, as of December 2017, most IEA members rely at least in part on private rather than public reserves to meet their obligations, and most hold significant proportions of these reserves as petroleum products rather than as crude oil. IEA data as of December 2017 show that 18 of the 25 IEA member countries rely at least in part on private reserves to meet their obligation. Unlike the 18 countries that rely at least in part on private reserves, as of December 2017, the United States and 6 other IEA members met the 90-day reserve obligation exclusively through public reserves. While DOE has examined a range of sizes for the SPR, it has not identified the optimal size for the SPR to meet U.S. energy security needs and IEA obligations, and DOE's analysis of SPR sizes was limited in three ways. DOE's review did not fully consider recent and expected future changes in crude oil and petroleum market conditions such as the implications of projected fluctuations in U.S. net imports or the role that increased levels of private reserves could play in responding to supply disruptions. DOE also did not perform a full cost-benefit analysis of holding different volumes of reserves. Without supplementing its 2016 review by conducting additional analysis, and periodically conducting such analyses going forward, DOE cannot provide information to Congress to inform decisions about the appropriate size of the SPR and risks holding too much or too little in the SPR to meet the United States' evolving energy security needs and international obligations. DOE has taken steps to take into account the effects of congressionally mandated oil sales in its plans for modernizing the SPR, though DOE's current plans are based on information largely developed prior to the most recent congressionally mandated oil sales. DOE has taken steps to update its modernization plans, but is hindered by uncertainty regarding the SPR's long-term size. DOE now assumes that the reserve will hold about 405 million barrels of oil and that one of the four SPR sites may close after congressionally mandated sales are completed at the end of fiscal year 2027, according to agency officials. However, these plans are largely based on information DOE analyzed before recent congressionally mandated oil sales. Without action by DOE to reduce the SPR's design capacity or otherwise use SPR facilities, congressionally mandated sales will cause excess storage capacity to grow to 308 million barrels or more by the end of fiscal year 2027\u2014meaning that about 43 percent of the SPR's total design capacity to store oil would be unused. DOE plans to explore some options to use these potentially excess SPR assets in its ongoing post-sale configuration study. However, DOE does not have the authority to pursue these options, according to agency officials. Without examining a full range of options in the post-sale configuration study for handling potentially excess SPR assets, DOE risks missing beneficial ways to modernize the SPR while saving taxpayer resources. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOE supplement its 2016 strategic review with an additional analysis that takes into account private sector response, oil market projections, and costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes. DOE agreed with two of GAO's recommendations and partially agreed with one.",
    "gao_GAO-18-53": "Why GAO Did This Study The HCV program, administered by HUD, subsidizes housing costs for low-income households in the private rental market. Households seeking to enter the HCV program may wait years for their local PHA to announce an open application period. PHAs may establish waiting lists if the number of applicants to the program exceeds available vouchers, and may close the waiting list if it contains more households than the PHA can assist in the near future. PHAs may also establish waiting lists if the number of applicants to the program exceeds available vouchers, and may close the waiting list if it contains more households than the PHA can assist in the near future. GAO was asked to review fraud schemes against HCV program participants. This report describes (1) the types of reported fraud schemes committed against HCV participants (including older adults), awareness by PHAs and other relevant organizations of fraud incidents and how often they occur, and indicators of such schemes online; and (2) antifraud regulations, guidance, and informational materials, if any, that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and PHAs have in place to identify and mitigate fraud against program participants. GAO analyzed HUD fraud alerts and consumer complaint data from 2011 through 2016; surveyed a nationally representative sample of PHAs; and conducted covert testing of rental advertisements posted online and commercial websites offering information to participants about the HCV program. GAO also interviewed officials from HUD, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Department of Health and Human Services. What GAO Found Fraud schemes against Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) participants can occur at each point in the HCV application and rental process, according to program officials and GAO analysis of consumer complaint data. Fraud schemes include (1) waiting-list placement fraud, (2) rental-advertisement fraud, (3) side-payment fraud, (4) security-deposit fraud, (5) program-compliance fraud against landlords, and (6) program-compliance fraud against landlords. An overwhelming majority of surveyed Public Housing Agencies (PHA) did not report awareness of any occurrences of most fraud types that could affect HCV program participants, while those that were aware of fraud against participants reported few instances. GAO's covert testing using undercover tools and techniques found no indicators of fraud in rental advertisements posted online, and few indicators of fraud in commercial websites offering information to participants about the HCV program. Through covert testing using undercover tools and techniques, GAO found no indicators of fraud in rental advertisements posted online, and few indicators of fraud in commercial websites offering information to participants about the HCV program. HUD regulations and guidance and PHA informational materials pertinent to fraud primarily focus on protecting the HCV program rather than protecting participants from fraud committed by external parties. For example, where the regulations mention fraud explicitly, it is generally in relation to mitigating program violations by owners and voucher program participants, recovering program losses from fraud, and assessing participants, applicants, and owners for participation or continued participation in the program. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. HUD, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Department of Health and Human Services had no comments on the report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-483": "Why GAO Did This Study Puerto Rico is the most populous U.S. territory with approximately 3.3 million residents. Puerto Rico is subject to the same federal laws as the states and their residents, except in cases where specific exemptions have been made, such as with certain federal programs. In May 2016, DOL revised the overtime regulations relating to the EAP exemption. In May 2016, DOL again updated the salary level threshold for EAP employees to $47,476 in the 2016 Overtime Rule. GAO was asked to review the economic conditions in Puerto Rico. This report addresses (1) the economic conditions in Puerto Rico as of the end of 2016; and (2) the potential effects of implementing the 2016 Overtime Rule on Puerto Rico's economy. GAO analyzed (1) the economic conditions in Puerto Rico as of the end of 2016; and (2) the potential effects of implementing the 2016 Overtime Rule on Puerto Rico's economy. GAO analyzed Puerto Rico's economic data from 1990 through 2016 and passenger data for Puerto Rican airports for years 2016 and 2017 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. GAO also interviewed officials and experts. What GAO Found Unreliable economic data make conditions in Puerto Rico difficult to evaluate prior to Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico's economy has been in an economic decline for more than a decade. From 2005 to 2016, Puerto Rico's gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by over 9 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Beginning in 2006, Puerto Rico's economy experienced declines in real output in 9 of the next 11 years, as measured by real GDP. While GAO has concerns about the precision of the Planning Board's real GDP measure from year to year, as discussed later, GAO is confident in the downward direction of growth. Puerto Rico officials described the economic contraction as a downward spiral, where negative economic growth spurred outmigration by skilled workers, leading to decreased tax revenue and thereby increasing public debt per capita. This, in turn, they said decreases new investment and the cycle repeats. Outdated methods for measuring GDP make it difficult for the Puerto Rico government to fully analyze specific economic needs and develop long-range plans. There is no federal statistical measure of Puerto Rico's GDP. The U.S. Census' Economic Census of Island Areas provides some limited insights into Puerto Rico's economic performance by industry, including revenue, payroll, employee count, and inventories. The Planning Board calculates GDP, but its methods are outdated and therefore unreliable, as they do not provide a precise measure of economic activity. Specifically, a 2011 White House Task Force Report examining Puerto Rico's economic challenges found the Planning Board's methods were outdated because they did not follow the same standards used for the rest of the United States. The Task Force also found that the methodology was not in line with modern statistical techniques, resulting in a less precise measure of Puerto Rico's economic activity. Federal labor statistics for Puerto Rico are incomplete because the Current Population Survey (CPS) does not include Puerto Rico and four other U.S. territories, and the American Community Survey (ACS) primarily provides data on population and housing, rather than labor. The Department of Labor (DOL) estimated that about 4.2 million (or about 2.6 percent) of Puerto Rico's total workforce would have been affected by the 2016 Overtime Rule. In its analysis of the 2016 Overtime Rule for Puerto Rico, GAO estimated that about 47,250 (about 4.5 percent) of 1.06 million wage and salary workers in Puerto Rico would have been directly affected. The lack of data from CPS on Puerto Rico and the effects of Hurricane Maria hinder GAO's ability to fully assess the potential effect of the 2016 Overtime Rule on Puerto Rico. Instead, GAO used data from the 2015 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) to estimate the impact of the 2016 Overtime Rule on Puerto Rico. The ACS employment data lack multiple variables available in the CPS; hence, GAO was limited in what GAO could estimate. GAO did not provide similar insights because of the difference in variables in the ACS and CPS. GAO held facilitated discussion groups with Puerto Rican employers in manufacturing, restaurant, hotel, hospital, and professional services industries to gain insight into how employers would have responded if the 2016 Overtime Rule were implemented in Puerto Rico. Views reported by participants in these groups may not be representative of all Puerto Rico employers, but they provide illustrative examples of the types of steps employers might have taken if the 2016 Overtime Rule were implemented. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Commerce (1) ensure that the Bureau of Economic Analysis includes Puerto Rico in its reporting on gross domestic product, as it does for four other U.S. territories; (2) conduct a study on the feasibility of including Puerto Rico in its reporting of the",

The breach resulted in the disclosure of sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, that had been compromised. GAO was asked to review the 2017 breach. This report (1) summarizes the events regarding the 2017 breach and the steps taken by the company to assess, respond to, and recover from the incident and (2) describes the actions that federal customers and oversight agencies took in response to the breach. GAO reviewed relevant laws and agency documents, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed contracts between Equifax and three major federal agencies, including IRS, SSA, and USPS, to determine what changes were made to services, such as identity-proofing solutions, provided by Equifax to federal agencies as a result of the breach. What GAO Found In March 2017, unidentified individuals discovered the presence of a known vulnerability in software running on the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Equifax's online dispute portal that could be used to obtain access to the system. In May of that year, attackers exploited the vulnerability and began to extract data containing PII from Equifax's information systems. According to Equifax, the attackers used a number of techniques to disguise their exploit of the Equifax systems and the database queries they conducted. On July 29, 2017, Equifax discovered the breach and reported that it took actions to address the factors that allowed the attackers to successfully gain access to its network. Further, the company reported that it took steps to identify, notify, and provide support to individuals who were potentially impacted by the breach. After the breach, federal customer agencies took a variety of actions based on their responsibilities and how the breach affected their operations. Specifically, the agencies that were customers of the company's services conducted independent assessments of the company's security controls, revised their own identity proofing processes, and made changes to their contracts with Equifax, among other activities. Equifax did not ask the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is the central agency that responds to cyber incidents across the federal government, to assist in responding to the breach. Nevertheless, the department took the step of reminding federal agencies of the importance of correcting the software vulnerability that led to the breach. In addition, the oversight agencies, BCFP and FTC, began taking actions to investigate the breach and inform the public. What GAO Recommends GAO has previously made recommendations to agencies regarding the protection of PII, and proposed Matters for Congressional Consideration in areas where laws could be enhanced. In addition, GAO has proposed two Matters for Congressional Consideration related to data protection.",

    "gao_GAO-18-702T": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS is responsible for ensuring that taxpayers are properly accounted for and taxed. IRS has a complex and broad information technology infrastructure that includes a variety of systems and processes. The agency has a long history of attempting to verify the authenticity of taxpayers' tax returns and has a long history of attempting to prevent refund fraud. In 2015, GAO reported on the challenges IRS faces in attempting to prevent refund fraud. This testimony discusses (1) IRS's efforts to address its authentication challenges and (2) additional actions IRS could take to strengthen its efforts to protect taxpayers from identity-based tax fraud. This statement is based on GAO's report, IRS: Efforts to Address Authentication Challenges and Protect Taxes, GAO-17-139, issued in December 2017. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has broad efforts underway to address its taxpayer authentication challenges. Specifically, IRS created an Identity Assurance Office in 2015 to work with stakeholders across IRS to review and assess the agency's various authentication programs and efforts. In 2016, IAO led an effort that identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication and categorized these interactions based on potential risks to the agency and taxpayers. In December 2016, IAO released its Roadmap for developing a modern and secure authentication environment for all taxpayers regardless of how they interact with IRS\u2014online, over the telephone, in person, or via correspondence. GAO also found that IRS is working to address its authentication challenges by collaborating with industry members and state partners via the Security Summit. The Security Summit was established in 2015 as an ongoing effort between industry experts from tax software companies, paid preparers, financial institutions, and states to improve information sharing and fraud detection and to address common identity-based tax (IDT) challenges. In its Roadmap, IRS outlined six core authentication objectives, 10 high-level strategic efforts, and 14 foundational initiatives to help it address authentication challenges and identify opportunities for future investment. While GAO found that IRS has made progress on some efforts identified in its Roadmap, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. For example, one of IRS's foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, such as when they file a return or request a tax transcript. Such notifications could help IRS and taxpayers detect potentially fraudulent activity at the earliest stage and help improve authentication of tax returns. However, IRS has not identified the resources required to complete these activities, and the Roadmap notes that six of the seven activities will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete. In December 2017, IRS officials stated that they had developed business requirements for the foundational initiative to give taxpayers greater control over their online accounts. However, IRS has not identified funding for the initiative's other supporting activities\u2014such as developing requirements to send push notifications to taxpayers\u2014and implementation will depend on the availability of future resources. Given the widespread availability of personally identifiable information that fraudsters can use to perpetrate tax fraud, it is essential for IRS to further strengthen taxpayer authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters' schemes. In its report, GAO identified two additional areas that IRS must address to better position the agency and protect taxpayers against future threats. First, GAO found that IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) June 2017 guidance for secure online authentication, however it had not yet established detailed plans, including timelines, milestone dates, and resource needs to fully implement it. Among other things, NIST's new guidance directs agencies to assess the risk for each component of identity assurance\u2014identity proofing, authentication, and federation\u2014 rather than conducting a single risk assessment for the entire process. According to NIST officials, this approach gives agencies flexibility in choosing technical solutions; aligns with existing, standards-based market offerings; is modular and cost-effective; and enhances individual privacy. Second, GAO found that IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches. GAO's discussions with representatives from industry and financial institutions and with government officials indicate that there is no single, ideal online authentication solution that will solve IRS's challenges related to IDT refund fraud. These representatives advocate an approach to authentication that relies on multiple strategies and sources of information, while giving taxpayers options for further protecting their information. GAO identified several authentication options in its report that IRS could consider, including the following: Possession-based authentication. This type of authentication offers users a convenient, added layer of security when used as a second factor for accessing websites or systems that would otherwise rely on a username and password for single-factor authentication.

VAMCs are required to manage their pharmacy inventory, which includes medications, supplies, and other items. GAO was asked to review VAMCs' approaches to managing their pharmacy inventory. This report examines (1) the approaches VAMCs take to manage their pharmacy inventory, and (2) the extent to which VA's oversight of VAMCs' pharmacy inventory management is adequate. GAO reviewed VA policies and procedures, interviewed VA officials, and visited five VAMCs selected based on size, location, and other factors. GAO also interviewed officials from PBM, VA's pharmacy benefit manager, and five VISNs. What GAO Found GAO found that all five of the selected Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers (VAMC) have generally similar approaches for managing their pharmacy inventory. However, some VAMCs have also taken unique approaches in implementing two steps of the pharmacy inventory management process: procurement and tracking. VA policy outlines parameters for VAMCs to manage their pharmacy inventories, and VA officials told GAO that VAMC pharmacy staff can use discretion to implement their own approaches for managing their pharmacy inventories. VA does not yet have a VA-wide pharmacy inventory management system in place that would allow it to monitor VAMC pharmacy inventory in real time and provide better oversight of how VAMC pharmacies manage their inventories. GAO found that VA's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and the five VISNs GAO reviewed provide some oversight related to VAMC pharmacy inventory management. However, that oversight is limited, as no entity has been assigned responsibility for overseeing system-wide performance of VAMC pharmacies in managing their inventories. Without a VA-wide inventory management system, PBM officials told GAO that they have employed manual workaround mechanisms to oversee pharmacy management processes. Specifically, PBM requires VAMC pharmacies to conduct an annual inventory of all medications and a quarterly inventory of 5 selected high-value, non-controlled substances at risk of diversion. PBM officials acknowledged that these manual workarounds are inefficient, increase labor costs, and leave the agency with an inability to see on-hand inventory across the system in real time. Additionally, PBM officials told GAO they hold regular meetings with the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and VAMCs, which provide the opportunity for discussion of pharmacy inventory management issues. However, GAO's review of the minutes of these meetings found that, over the past 3 years, pharmacy inventory management was rarely a topic of discussion.

    "gao_GAO-19-75": "Why GAO Did This Study FCC has reported that wireless technologies that access spectrum to deliver broadband services are cost-effective for remote and sparsely populated areas, such as tribal lands. However, FCC's efforts to promote and support tribal entities' access to spectrum have done little to increase tribal use of spectrum, as only very few tribes are accessing spectrum to be able to provide Internet service. GAO was asked to review tribal entities' efforts to obtain and access spectrum. This report examines (1) what is known about the ability of tribal entities to obtain and access spectrum to provide broadband services on tribal lands and the reported barriers that may exist; and (2) the extent to which FCC promotes and supports tribal entities' ability to obtain and access spectrum for broadband services. GAO analyzed FCC license data as of September 2018, interviewed FCC officials, and analyzed FCC license data from license data and license information publicly available through FCC's Universal Licensing System. GAO also interviewed representatives from 24 tribal entities, 13 Indian tribes and nations, and 11 tribally owned providers. What GAO Found Few tribal entities have obtained licenses to use the radio frequency spectrum (RFS) that FCC uses to provide broadband services. FCC license data show that 18 tribal entities held active licenses in bands that can be used to provide broadband services. FCC license data show that most of these tribal entities obtained the licenses through FCC administrative assignment rather than through an FCC spectrum auction or secondary market transaction. FCC license data show that most of the tribal entities obtained the licenses through FCC administrative assignment rather than through an FCC spectrum auction or secondary market transaction. Representatives from the tribal entities GAO contacted identified several barriers to accessing licensed spectrum through spectrum auctions and secondary market transactions. For example, representatives from 13 of 16 tribal entities that provide wireless Internet service most frequently (13 of 16) indicated that spectrum licenses are too expensive for tribal entities. In addition, representatives from 8 of the 16 tribal entities, one of the tribal representative groups, and an industry association GAO contacted stated that license holders are often unwilling to participate in secondary market transactions, citing a variety of reasons. FCC has taken some actions to increase tribal access to and use of spectrum, but FCC does not collect or communicate key information to tribal entities. FCC has initiated proposed rulemakings on promoting tribal access to spectrum, adopted rules to increase spectrum available for broadband use, and conducted outreach and training for tribal entities on spectrum-related issues. However, these efforts were not targeted to tribal entities, and according to FCC officials, allocating additional unlicensed spectrum may not be a technically feasible solution for all tribal entities, and such spectrum may not have the necessary capacity to handle an increase in users. FCC has also implemented rules that may make it easier for rural providers to obtain licenses. However, these efforts were not targeted to tribal entities, and according to FCC officials, allocating additional unlicensed spectrum may not be a technically feasible solution for all tribal entities, and such spectrum may not have the necessary capacity to handle an increase in users. FCC has not consistently collected information related to tribal access to spectrum. For example, FCC does not collect data on whether holders of spectrum licenses or auction applicants are tribal entities even though it collects self-reported data on licensee type, such as corporation and government entity. To obtain this information, FCC could include an option for the licensee type, along with the other options, in applications for future licenses and auctions that allows an applicant to identify as a tribal government or tribally owned entity. FCC officials told GAO that they use information on licensee type to determine eligibility for a license. Because eligibility is not based on whether the applicant is a tribal entity, FCC officials said this information is not needed. However, without this information, FCC does not have a comprehensive understanding of the extent that tribal entities are attempting to obtain or access licensed spectrum or have been successful at obtaining and accessing it. Additionally, FCC does not analyze information on unused licensed spectrum that exists over tribal lands, even though FCC has information\u2014broadband availability data from providers and information on geographic areas covered by spectrum licenses\u2014that could be used for such analysis. FCC officials told GAO that they evaluate the effectiveness of FCC's secondary markets policies, which FCC views as a mechanism to promote the increased use of unused spectrum licenses, but this approach does not include an analysis of unused spectrum licenses as part of these efforts. As a result, FCC's evaluations of the secondary market may not accurately reflect how these policies affect tribal access to spectrum.

    "gao_GAO-18-106": "Why GAO Did This Study CSPF is one of the largest multiemployer pension plans in the United States. In 1982, CSPF was the subject of investigations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOL investigation ultimately resulted in the establishment of a federal court-enforceable consent decree in 1982 that remains in force today. GAO was asked to review CSPF. This report examines (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition; (2) what has been CSPF's investment policy, and the process for setting and executing it, since the consent decree was established; and (3) how CSPF has performed over time, particularly compared to similar pension plans. GAO analyzed CSPF's regulatory filings, investment and fee data, and other documents; interviewed CSPF officials and stakeholders; and analyzed CSPF's investment returns and fees. What GAO Found The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) has been underfunded since the consent decree was established in 1982. CSPF's funding has generally deteriorated since 2002, according to regulatory filings. CSPF's funding has generally deteriorated since 2002, according to regulatory filings. CSPF officials and other stakeholders identified several factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition and reflect the challenges faced by many multiemployer plans. For example, many multiemployer plans have experienced financial difficulties due to a combination of investment losses and insufficient employer contributions. In addition to being underfunded prior to the consent decree going into effect, stakeholders identified other specific factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, such as trends within the national trucking industry and its workforce, funding challenges and common investment practices of multiemployer plans, and the impact of market downturns on long-term investment performance. Stakeholders also described the effects of the 2007 withdrawal of a key employer, United Parcel Service (UPS), on CSPF's critical financial condition. CSPF's investment policy has generally increased allocation to equities, but shifted toward fixed income in 2017, after the plan was projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF's investment returns and fees in recent decades have generally been in line with the annual returns of a customized peer group provided by the investment consultant Wilshire. For example, CSPF's annual investment returns were above the median in 12 years and below the median in the other 10 years. CSPF's investment fees and administrative expenses were in line with other large multiemployer plans. For example, CSPF's average investment fee expense ratio was 34 basis points (0.34 percent) while the median of the averages for GAO's large plan comparison group was 37 basis points (0.37 percent). CSPF's administrative expenses were also in line with a broader group of comparators. For example, CSPF's administrative expenses were at or above the median of the large comparator group in 3 years (2001, 2004, and 2005), but lower than the median in all other years of the 2000 to 2014 period.

FCC has also developed maps and reports depicting broadband services nationwide, and in specific locations, such as tribal lands, but does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the broadband data. In 2010, FCC recommended that FCC work with tribes to ensure that any information collected is accurate and useful. In 2011, FCC required that providers serving tribal lands meaningfully engage with tribes regarding communications services, including broadband. FCC's 2012 tribal engagement guidance states that FCC would update the tribal engagement guidance and develop best practices based on feedback from tribal governments and broadband providers. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband availability data on tribal lands. This report discusses the extent to which (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband availability data accurately captures the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data for tribal lands. GAO analyzed FCC's data on broadband availability and interviewed FCC officials, providers, and tribal stakeholders. GAO also interviewed FCC officials and industry associations. What GAO Found The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects and uses data that capture broadband availability to measure broadband access on tribal lands, leading to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC's method of collecting mobile and fixed broadband data from providers (the Form 477) does not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands because it (1) captures nationwide broadband availability data\u2014areas where providers may have broadband infrastructure\u2014but does so in a way that leads to overstatements of availability, and (2) does not capture information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access on tribal lands, such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. Nonetheless, FCC uses its Form 477 broadband availability data in annual broadband deployment reports to measure the percentage of Americans living on tribal lands with or without access to broadband, and to measure progress toward FCC's strategic goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. By using broadband availability data to measure broadband access on tribal lands, FCC overstates broadband access on tribal lands. FCC uses its Form 477 broadband availability data in annual broadband deployment reports to measure the percentage of Americans living on tribal lands with or without access to broadband, and to measure progress toward FCC's strategic goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband.

By using broadband availability data to measure broadband access on tribal lands, FCC overstates broadband access on tribal lands. FCC uses its Form 477 data to develop maps and datasets depicting broadband services nationwide, and in specific locations, such as tribal lands, but does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the broadband data. FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan noted the need for the federal government to improve the quality of data regarding broadband on tribal lands and recommended that FCC work with tribes to ensure that any information collected is accurate and useful. FCC officials stated that they address questions and concerns regarding provider coverage claims submitted to the Office of Native Affairs and Policy, which will work with tribal governments to help them identify inaccurate broadband data for tribal lands, and share tribal questions and concerns with the appropriate FCC bureaus. However, FCC does not have a formal process for tribes (or other governmental entities) to provide input to ensure that the broadband data FCC collects through the Form 477 process, or the resulting maps that FCC creates to depict broadband on tribal lands, are accurate. Similarly, FCC does not use other methods to verify provider-submitted Form 477 data on tribal lands against other sources of information, such as on-site tests or data collected by other agencies. FCC officials stated that they provide some outreach and technical assistance to tribal officials at regional and national workshops, while about half of the tribal representatives GAO interviewed raised concerns about a lack of outreach from FCC to inform tribes about the data. FCC officials stated that they provide some",

GAO was asked to review the extent to which high-poverty schools offer courses to prepare students academically for college. This report examines (1) the extent to which high schools of different poverty levels offer courses to prepare students academically for college and (2) challenges that students in high-poverty schools face in being prepared to attend college. GAO analyzed federal data on college preparatory course offerings by school poverty level quartiles; analyzed course offerings by school type, size, and locale; and interviewed officials from all four public, 4-year universities GAO visited. GAO also visited 12 high-poverty high schools in three states selected based on the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Education and Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of Education data for school year 2015-16 showed that high-poverty high schools were predominately comprised of Black and Hispanic students, while low-poverty schools had a higher proportion of White students. Access to more advanced math and science courses (e.g., calculus and physics) decreased as the level of school poverty increased. Larger high schools offered more advanced math and science courses than smaller schools, regardless of poverty level. Charter schools offered fewer advanced math and science courses than traditional and magnet schools, regardless of poverty level. Public 4-year colleges generally expect applicants to have completed three or four math and three or four science credits in high school, but GAO found that the percentage of schools offering these recommended courses decreased as poverty level increased. Officials representing the 12 high-poverty schools GAO visited consistently reported that students confront multiple challenges to being prepared to attend college. They cited a range of academic roadblocks to college, including that students are behind academically before they get to high school; that the schools they attend lack rigorous courses, such as Advanced Placement (AP) courses; and that students struggle to attain grade point averages (GPA) high enough for admission to some 4-year colleges. Officials said that family challenges and obligations can compound the academic challenges and make navigating the college admissions and enrollment process difficult for their students. Officials from all four public, 4-year universities GAO visited reported that they try to mitigate the barriers students in high-poverty schools face in being prepared to attend a 4-year college, despite resource challenges. For example, one Georgia high school allows students to earn college credit for free while working on their high school diploma. Officials from half of the schools GAO visited reported their schools had, or previously had, federal grants that supported college readiness activities for disadvantaged students. Officials from all four public, 4-year universities GAO visited reported that they have initiatives to help increase admissions or ease the transition to college for low-income or first-generation students. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Education and Justice provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",

HHS-OIG can require an entity to enter into an agreement in exchange for a release of HHS-OIG's exclusion authority. GAO was asked to review HHS-OIG's use of its exclusion authority. This report examines (1) the number and types of agreements HHS-OIG entered into from 2005 through 2017, (2) the criteria HHS-OIG uses to evaluate whether to exercise its exclusion authority and in negotiating agreements, and (3) the strategies HHS-OIG uses to ensure compliance with agreements and the penalties HHS-OIG may impose when noncompliance is identified. GAO reviewed HHS-OIG data from 2005 through 2017, reviewed HHS-OIG guidance, and interviewed HHS-OIG officials. GAO also reviewed HHS-OIG's agreement templates and interviewed HHS-OIG officials. What GAO Found From 2005 through 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Inspector General (HHS-OIG) entered into 652 new agreements\u2014an average of about 50 agreements per year\u2014ranging from a high of 83 to a low of 37. The agreements were almost exclusively CIAs, which apply to larger corporations, and IAs, which apply to individual practitioners and entities such as small physician groups. HHS-OIG has used CIAs and IAs exclusively since 2010. From 2010 to July 2017, 74 percent of agreements have been CIAs and 26 percent of agreements have been IAs. HHS-OIG entered into agreements with a wide range of entities, but most were concentrated among a few types of entities. Specifically, HHS-OIG entered into agreements with 30 different types of entities from July 2005 through July 2017, though slightly more than half of the agreements were with 3 types\u2014individual/small group practices, hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities. Another quarter of the agreements were with medical group practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinics, medical device manufacturers, and ambulance companies. HHS-OIG considers risk factors, such as an entity's conduct, when evaluating whether to exercise its exclusion authority and in negotiating agreements. HHS-OIG guidance includes the criteria that agency officials said they follow to determine whether to exercise the agency's permissive exclusion authority, or take an alternate action, such as entering into an agreement with an entity. HHS-OIG has four broad categories of criteria that it applies in deciding where an entity falls on the risk continuum and which action to take. These four categories are (1) the nature and circumstances of the conduct; (2) conduct during the government's investigation; (3) whether the entity has made efforts to improve its conduct; and (4) the entity's history of compliance. HHS-OIG has developed agreement templates that include standard provisions to address the risks an entity's noncompliance could pose to federal health care programs. Additionally, in some templates, provisions are included to address the specific types of conduct that gave rise to the agreement. HHS-OIG uses multiple strategies to ensure compliance with agreements and imposes certain penalties when noncompliance is identified. HHS-OIG uses escalating steps, such as requiring the entity to submit required reports or conducting site visits, to ensure compliance with the terms of agreements. HHS-OIG officials said that when noncompliance occurs, the most common issue is the late submission of required reports or reviews. According to HHS-OIG officials, other types of noncompliance range from falsely certifying the accuracy of reported information to submitting reports that do not include the required elements.

The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 amended the U.S.-CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. The act was further amended in August 2017 to, among other things, (1) add 350 CW-1 permits to the fiscal year 2017 cap; (2) restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations; and (3) increase the CNMI education funding fee that employers must pay for each permit from $150 to $200. DHS determines the annual cap on CW-1 permits and the terms and conditions of the CW program. In November 2017, DHS set the cap for CW-1 permits for fiscal year 2018 through the end of the program. This testimony discusses (1) the number of CW-1 permits allocated each year, (2) the distribution of the permits, and (3) a new CW-3 worker designation. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on the CNMI's economy, tourism, and labor market. GAO reviewed DHS and CNMI tax data, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, just north of Guam and about 3,200 miles west of Hawaii. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 amended the U.S.-CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. To provide for an orderly transition from the CNMI immigration system to the U.S. federal immigration system under the immigration laws of the United States, DHS established the CW program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers are able to obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI for up to a year. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 requires DHS to annually reduce the number of CW-1 permits until the number reaches zero by the end of the transition period. The act was further amended in August 2017 to, among other things, (1) add 350 CW-1 permits to the fiscal year 2017 cap; (2) restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations; and (3) increase the CNMI education funding fee that employers must pay for each permit from $150 to $200. DHS determines the annual cap on CW-1 permits and the terms and conditions of the CW program. In November 2017, DHS set the cap for CW-1 permits for fiscal year 2018 through the end of the program. The proposed bill, the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act (S. 2325), includes the following provisions, among others, that would affect the CW program: (1) the number of permits to be allocated each year, (2) the distribution of the permits, and (3) a new CW-3 worker designation. The CNMI's inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has grown each year since 2012. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that the CNMI's GDP increased by almost 29 percent in 2016 after increasing by about 4 percent in 2015. BEA attributes this economic growth to a significant increase in visitor spending, particularly for casino gambling, and investment in the construction of a casino resort in Saipan and other hotel construction. The CNMI's tourism market has experienced considerable fluctuation, as evidenced by total annual visitor arrivals. Visitor arrivals to the CNMI declined from a peak of 726,690 in fiscal year 1997 to a low of 338,106 in fiscal year 2011, or by 53 percent. However, since 2011, visitor arrivals have nearly doubled, reaching 653,150 in fiscal year 2017, and increased by 30 percent from 2016 to 2017. The CNMI's labor market continues to experience growing demand for workers. In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of CW-1 permits almost doubled, and since fiscal year 2016, the number of permits has approached the numerical limits on permits for those years. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CW-1 permits grew from 7,127 in fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016. On October 14, 2016\u20142 weeks into fiscal year 2017\u2014USCIS announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2017 and would not accept requests for new permits for that year during the remaining 11 months.

IoT devices are expected to increase as companies bring new technologies and services to market and government users. GAO was asked to examine the challenges facing federal spectrum managers and the steps they are taking to address those challenges. This report examines (1) the spectrum-related challenges stakeholders identified due to the anticipated growth of IoT, (2) steps FCC and NTIA are taking to plan for the anticipated growth in the demand for spectrum as a result of IoT, and (3) efforts that selected leading countries are undertaking to plan for IoT's spectrum needs and ways that these efforts compare with those of the United States. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from FCC and NTIA, as well as stakeholders from industry associations, telecommunications companies, and nonprofit groups. GAO also surveyed seven countries of potential interest, all of which have conducted spectrum planning in support of IoT. What GAO Found Stakeholders representing IoT network providers, device manufacturers, users, and federal regulators consistently identified two spectrum-related challenges to the continued growth and development of IoT: (1) ensuring the availability of sufficient spectrum and (2) managing the harmful interference from the increasing number of IoT devices. Stakeholders identified three dimensions of the spectrum availability challenge: the amount, the balance between licensed and unlicensed, and the variety of spectrum bands available. According to some reports, incorrectly anticipating industry needs in any of these areas could weaken IoT growth and development in the United States. To plan for spectrum needs, FCC has repurposed spectrum by making additional spectrum available for commercial purposes and, according to FCC officials, the agency is continuing to look for additional opportunities to do so. For example, in 2016, FCC issued a final order that opened up high-band spectrum (above 24 GHz) for use with 5G networks and applications. This particular rulemaking from FCC opened up a total of 10.85 GHz of spectrum, 3.85 GHz for licensed mobile use and 7 GHz for unlicensed use. According to FCC officials, the agency is continuing to look for additional opportunities to do so. FCC officials said that the agency tracks industry-produced trends and projections related to spectrum demand and use but does not focus on specific devices. Rather, it relies on network providers to manage and track the spectrum related to specific device types. When more spectrum is needed, FCC officials said that FCC identifies additional spectrum and makes it available to the commercial sector. However, this reactive approach may not adequately address the risks caused by high-bandwidth and unlicensed-spectrum devices. Federal standards for internal control instruct agencies to address risks such as these by estimating the significance of the risk, analyzing the likelihood of it occurring, and assessing its nature. Such assessments can be used to determine how to respond to the potential risks that could prevent agencies from meeting their goals. Rapid, unexpected growth in these IoT sectors could lead to spectrum congestion and interference that could slow or halt the economic growth associated with IoT until FCC can make additional spectrum available. Selected leading countries are among the world leaders in the development of IoT. GAO contacted public and private officials in these countries to identify their approaches to spectrum planning to address the growth of IoT. Those officials described approaches to planning for future spectrum needs that are similar to the United States in one area but different in others. Specifically, GAO found that all four countries practice technology neutral spectrum planning, an approach that was broadly supported by the stakeholders GAO interviewed, including wireless carriers, a technology manufacturer, academics, and a nonprofit group. Some of these stakeholders indicated that this approach to spectrum planning encourages innovation as it allows developers to choose the most appropriate spectrum bands for new technology without having to take the extra step of getting regulators' permission for each new device or application. Two of the selected leading countries, Germany and South Korea, have developed national IoT plans focused on developing IoT for industry; however, only South Korea has a plan that specifically addresses spectrum issues. Officials in each of these countries told GAO that it was necessary to coordinate spectrum planning with other countries on their borders. Officials in each of these countries told GAO that one way that they address the potential challenge of spectrum congestion is through the use of spectrum-sharing arrangements. Representatives from the four countries told GAO that they are concerned about the potential for spectrum congestion, due to growth in the number of IoT devices. However, like FCC in the United States, these officials do not currently believe such congestion presents an immediate problem. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that F",
    "gao_GAO-18-187T": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2012 Act required FirstNet to establish a network to provide public safety with access to the spectrum needed to support the safety of the nation's people and infrastructure. The Act also required FirstNet to develop a framework to meet the financial requirements established in the 2012 Act. This testimony discusses (1) FirstNet's progress establishing and financing the network and consulting stakeholders, and (2) FirstNet's network reliability, security, and interoperability challenges and efforts to address them. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report, which examined (1) FirstNet's progress establishing and financing the network and consulting stakeholders, and (2) FirstNet's contract oversight mechanisms. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from FirstNet, AT&T, and five tribal organizations. What GAO Found In its June 2017 report, GAO found that FirstNet has conducted key efforts to establish the network, namely releasing the request for proposal for the network in January 2016 and awarding the network contract to AT&T in March 2017. As the contractor, AT&T will be responsible for the overall design, development, production, operation, and evolution of the network, as well as the marketing, product management, sales, distribution, and customer care. Further, GAO found that FirstNet has established a framework to meet the financial requirements established in the 2012 Act, as depicted in figure 1. This framework focuses on leveraging FirstNet's spectrum through the use of payments and fees with the aim of ensuring that the network is financially sustainable over the life of the contract and that FirstNet sustains self-funding operations. By establishing a single, dedicated network for public safety use, FirstNet's network is expected to foster greater interoperability and meet public safety officials' reliability and other needs. However, the actual use (or \"adoption\") of the network by public safety users will be voluntary. Thus, even with the establishment of this framework, substantial unknowns remain regarding how many public safety users will adopt the network, the extent to which AT&T will be successful in monetizing the spectrum to retain revenue from commercial users, and the extent to which this revenue will be sufficient or appropriate in relation to the capital needed to build, operate, and maintain the network. GAO also found that FirstNet has made progress consulting with state and local, federal, and tribal stakeholders through a variety of mechanisms. State officials GAO contacted were generally satisfied with FirstNet's efforts to engage them. However, tribal stakeholders GAO contacted expressed concern with FirstNet's efforts to consult with tribes per the 2012 Act's requirements. In particular, four of the five tribal organizations GAO contacted said that FirstNet has not fully engaged in effective communication or has relied on state points of contact too much as opposed to engaging directly with tribes; the other tribal organization was not aware of FirstNet or its mission at all. Further, tribes noted that individuals with first-hand knowledge of tribes' experiences are not able to represent tribal views directly among FirstNet's key decision makers. FirstNet has stated that, indeed, the 2012 Act requires that it consult with tribes through state points of contact. Nevertheless, several federal agencies have identified seeking a full understanding of tribal concerns\u2014and reaching consensus where possible\u2014as a key principle of effective tribal communication, noting that agencies should adapt to changing circumstances, contemplate creative problem solving, identify options for addressing concerns, and exhaust alternatives to achieve mutually agreeable solutions. GAO concluded that, by fully exploring and proposing actions to address tribal stakeholders' concerns, FirstNet could help improve its relations with tribes and better meet stakeholders' needs. As such, GAO recommended in its report that FirstNet fully explore tribal concerns and propose actions, as needed, to address those concerns. FirstNet agreed with this recommendation and, in September 2017, described to GAO the actions it has taken to implement it. For example, according to FirstNet, in September 2017 it began a process to formally explore the tribal outreach concerns raised in GAO's report and expects to propose improvements by the end of this year. FirstNet faces various challenges to ensure the network's reliability, security, and interoperability. For example, stakeholders raised concerns related to: providing network coverage to rural areas, in buildings, or ensuring the network's overall resiliency and cybersecurity; and managing frameworks for user identity, credentialing of users, access management, and prioritization of users on the network. However, both FirstNet and the Public Safety Safety Systems Research Center (PSCR) have begun research and other efforts to help ensure the reliability, security, and interoperability of the network and address the challenges raised by stakeholders. For example, in November 2016, FirstNet opened an Innovation and Test Lab at its technical",
    "gao_GAO-18-671": "Why GAO Did This Study The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided up to $10 billion in funding for veterans to obtain health care services from community providers through the Choice Program when veterans faced long wait times, lengthy travel distances, or other challenges accessing care at VA medical facilities. The Choice Program is expected to sunset on June 6, 2019. GAO was asked to review the timeliness of VA's payments to community providers under the Choice Program. This report examines (1) the length of time VA's TPAs have taken to pay community providers under the Choice Program, (2) the extent to which VA has monitored the timeliness of these payments, and (3) the extent to which VA has addressed the timeliness of these payments. GAO reviewed VA's TPA contracts and related documents, and interviewed VA and TPA officials and 15 community providers selected to represent a range of sizes and geographic locations. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (TPA) has taken a total of 7 days to process and pay 16 million clean claims under the Veterans Choice Program, which is a temporary program that provides funding to veterans to obtain health care services from community providers when they are unable to provide timely and accessible care at their own facilities. From November 2014 through June 2018, the median number of days VA's TPAs have taken to pay clean claims each month show wide variation over the course of the Choice Program\u2014from 7 days to 68 days. The data on the time TPAs have taken to pay clean claims do not fully account for the length of time taken to pay providers whose claims are initially rejected or denied, as, according to the TPAs, providers are generally required to submit a new claim when the original claim is rejected or denied. Thus, providers that submit claims that are rejected or denied may experience a longer wait for payment for those claims or may not be paid at all. VA and its TPAs identified three key factors affecting the timeliness of claim payments to community providers under the Choice Program: (1) VA's untimely payments of TPA invoices; (2) Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement; and (3) inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims. VA's experience with payment timeliness in the Choice Program informed VA's RFP for new contracts for the Veterans Community Care Program, which includes provisions that strengthen VA's ability to monitor its future TPAs. VA has taken steps to improve its ability to pay TPA invoices in a timely manner, but it has not fully addressed delays associated with authorizations for care. VA has taken steps to educate community providers in order to help prevent claims processing issues that have contributed to the length of time TPAs have taken to pay these providers. However, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed reported poor customer service when attempting to resolve claims payment issues. VA's contracts with TPAs do not include requirements for educating and training providers on the Choice Program, and both TPAs have taken steps to educate community providers on how to successfully submit claims under the Choice Program. However, both TPAs have taken steps to educate community providers on how to successfully submit claims under the Choice Program. Despite these efforts, 9 of the 15 providers GAO interviewed reported poor customer service when attempting to resolve claims payment issues.

VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-39": "Why GAO Did This Study The tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax owed and the amount of tax paid. IRS estimates that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5 trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010. IRS also estimates that taxpayers paid approximately $2.04 trillion voluntarily and on time for those years, on average, leaving $458 billion in unpaid taxes per year. However, IRS estimates that through late payments and enforcement actions it eventually will collect an additional $52 billion on average for those years, leaving the average net tax gap at $406 billion for 2008 to 2010. GAO was asked to review the tax gap. This report examines (1) the main drivers of the tax gap; (2) the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) confidence in the tax gap estimates; (3) IRS goals, if any, for reducing the tax gap; and (4) the extent to which IRS uses tax gap estimates and underlying data to develop strategies and actions to reduce the tax gap. GAO reviewed IRS's tax gap estimates and underlying data; interviewed IRS officials; and analyzed IRS's National Research Program (NRP) data. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5 trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010. IRS also estimated that taxpayers paid approximately $2.04 trillion voluntarily and on time for those years, on average, leaving $458 billion in unpaid taxes per year. However, IRS estimates that through late payments and enforcement actions it eventually will collect an additional $52 billion on average for those years, leaving the average net tax gap at $406 billion for 2008 to 2010. IRS officials stated that the tax gap estimates are sufficiently reliable for the intended purpose of providing a snapshot of tax compliance as a whole. IRS has more certainty in some areas of the estimate than others. Generally, IRS officials consider those components of the tax gap estimate that are based on the most current data (2008-2010 data) to be more robust. However, IRS recognizes that some component estimates of the tax gap estimate are more uncertain than others, in part because some component estimates rely on older data and it is inherently difficult to estimate some types of noncompliance. IRS has broad goals for increasing voluntary compliance, but lacks specific quantitative goals for reducing the tax gap. In 2005, GAO recommended that IRS establish a long-term quantitative voluntary compliance goal for individual income tax underreporting and for tax underpayment, as well as for other areas of noncompliance. IRS agreed with the concept of GAO's recommendation and, in response, established a voluntary compliance rate goal of 85 percent by 2009, which was published in IRS's fiscal year 2007 budget request. IRS has since moved away from that approach.

However, IRS has not documented a comprehensive strategy that shows, for example, how it intends to analyze and use the tax gap data, particularly from the NRP, to develop or improve compliance programs. Without a strategy that provides an overall picture of how NRP data are used, it may be difficult for Congress and other decision makers to understand the merits of what they are being asked to fund. Further, without developing and documenting a strategy for incorporating the results of NRP data, IRS risks not fully leveraging the compliance data it collects or not allocating enforcement resources in the most cost-effective manner. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS re-establish long-term, quantitative goals for improving voluntary compliance. IRS disagreed with GAO's recommendation that it re-establish long-term, quantitative goals for improving voluntary compliance.

This report examines (1) the number of grantees that were awarded grants from 2007 to 2015 and the extent to which they were exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, and (2) the extent to which federal agencies inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions through grant announcements.

However, HHS may award PATH grants directly to public or nonprofit entities if a state does not submit an application or does not meet program requirements. From this program, no grants were awarded to nonprofit organizations and therefore no FBOs were awarded grants. From these 18 programs, 931 grantees were awarded grants, including 19 GAO identified as potential FBOs. DOJ identified at least 34 relevant grant programs administered by OVW, COPS, and six different program offices within OJP that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. The 34 relevant grant programs represent the minimum number of grant programs that were subject to nondiscrimination provisions and for which nonprofit organizations were eligible from fiscal years 2007 through 2015. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher. GAO interviewed 6 of the 9 grantees that certified that they were exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. Each of the 6 grantees that GAO interviewed stated that: hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs to assist with grant activities was critical to their mission and organizational success; they include a \"statement of faith\" on their job application form and ask the applicant to attest to the statement of faith, or hired individuals of the same faith already employed within their organization; and had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant or they would have had to seek executive-level approval within their organization to apply for the grant. At least 3 of the 6 grantees stated that they were a recipient of other federal grant funding, but those grants were not subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, and therefore did not require an exemption to make hiring decisions based on religion. GAO interviewed 5 of the 35 potential faith-based grantees that received funding in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and that agencies reported had not filed a self-certification to be exempt from religious-based hiring restrictions. GAO interviewed 5 of these 35 grantees to discuss, among other things, whether the grantees were familiar with the exemption option. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions through grant announcements. The agencies also use additional methods that varied across all three agencies for providing this information to grantees. DOJ specifically made this information available on agency web pages as well as in the documentation that is provided to grant recipients. DOL has a web page devoted specifically to explaining statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring to faith-based grant applicants and recipients, which also covers the process for seeking exemptions from the restrictions. Additionally, DOL has prepared a guidance document\u2014available from its grants program overview web page\u2014that explains in detail the process for seeking exemptions and how they are reviewed and approved. A representative from the one potential FBO that received a DOL grant in fiscal years 2014 or 2015 but did not certify that they were exempt could not recall seeing information about the exemption option in the grant application or award documentation. Lastly, in addition to providing information in grant announcements, HHS provides all SAMHSA grant applicants seeking funds for substance abuse prevention and treatment services with",
    "gao_GAO-19-123": "Why GAO Did This Study EPA has a role in the Superfund program to clean up contaminated sites to protect human health and the environment from the effects of hazardous substances. EPA uses two systems to track sites that are on tribal property or that affect tribes, and the agency's efforts to consult with affected tribes, respectively. GAO was asked to review EPA's consultation with tribes regarding Superfund cleanup actions. This report examines (1) the extent to which EPA data identify sites that are on tribal property or that affect tribes, and (2) the extent to which EPA has data on the agency's consultation with tribes regarding Superfund cleanup actions. GAO reviewed agency data and documents, and interviewed EPA officials and tribal officials. GAO also reviewed EPA's tribal consultation policy and interviewed EPA officials and tribal officials. What GAO Found The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have reliable data on the sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes. Specifically, EPA data identifying sites that are on tribal property are not accurate or complete based on GAO's reviews of agency data and interviews with EPA officials. Specifically, EPA data identifying sites that are on tribal property are not accurate or complete because the agency's data regarding NPL sites on tribal property may not be accurate and provided explanations for why these data are unreliable. EPA headquarters officials told GAO that the agency's data regarding NPL sites on tribal property may not be accurate and provided explanations for why these data are unreliable. EPA data identifying which sites have known Native American Interest (NAI) are inaccurate and incomplete based on GAO's reviews of the data. For example, GAO found that EPA data identifying which sites have NAI are inaccurate and incomplete because EPA's guidance for making NAI determinations is unclear. EPA regional officials inconsistently determining and documenting sites with NAI. EPA data on tribes with interest in the sites that EPA identified as having NAI are not accurate or complete because EPA's guidance for making NAI determinations is unclear. EPA does not have reliable data on the agency's consultation with tribes regarding Superfund sites. According to data in the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS), consultation had occurred or was projected to occur at 18 sites since EPA's consultation and coordination policy went into effect in 2011. However, TCOTS data are incomplete and did not include records for 7 NPL sites where, based on GAO's interviews with EPA regional officials and a review of agency documents, GAO determined that consultation had occurred since 2011. One possible reason that EPA data on consultation with tribes are incomplete is that the agency's guidance regarding what constitutes consultation, and therefore is to be recorded in TCOTS, is unclear. EPA officials told GAO they consider consultation a specific, formal interaction that involves government-to-government interaction between tribal governments and senior EPA officials, such as Regional Administrators, and generally happens at major decision points or at the request of a tribe. EPA officials GAO interviewed clarified that the majority of day-to-day interaction with tribes do not require consultation and are less formal coordination efforts. EPA has taken various actions to address the unique needs of tribes when making cleanup decisions at NPL sites. These actions include efforts to minimize tribal members' exposure to contaminants and limit potential damage to tribal archeological sites. For example, EPA officials told GAO that at one site, regional officials rerouted and improved roads used to remove contaminated materials to minimize the impact of cleanup activities on historically significant cultural resources. EPA officials also provided examples of the use of traditional ecological knowledge at some NPL sites. EPA officials told GAO that some tribes may be reluctant to share some traditional ecological knowledge; however, headquarters and EPA regional officials told GAO that this was relatively infrequent and that, in these situations, EPA was able to work with the tribe to find ways to use more general information to inform decisions regarding Superfund cleanups. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EPA develop a regular review process to ensure the quality of SEMS data identifying NPL sites on tribal property and revise automated reports used to check the accuracy of these data. EPA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-126": "Why GAO Did This Study The Kansas City site is the nation's primary site for procuring or producing nonnuclear parts and components, providing over 80 percent of the parts and components that compose a typical nuclear weapon. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review calls for NNSA to resume a program to replace the W78 warhead in fiscal year 2019; produce a low-yield submarine launched ballistic missile warhead by 1 year; and consider options for providing a nuclear warhead for a potential sea-launched cruise missile. The Senate committee report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the Kansas City site's staffing plans and capabilities to meet national security requirements. This report examines (1) workload forecasts for the Kansas City site since 2012, and (2) management challenges the Kansas City site has identified for achieving the forecasted workload and actions the site has taken to mitigate these challenges. GAO reviewed NNSA and contractor documents and interviewed officials from NNSA and contractor representatives at the site. What GAO Found Projected workload for the Kansas City site has increased significantly, based on NNSA's stockpile plan changes from 2012\u2014when the new modern facility was built\u2014to the 2018 stockpile plan update. A comparison between the 2012 and 2018 plans shows that the start of full production for the B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP) and the W88 Alt 370 weapons systems were delayed by approximately 2 years, and their completions were delayed by 3 years from initial schedule estimates in 2012. The 2018 plan also accelerates production of the W80-4 LEP by approximately 5 years. Using an enterprise risk management approach, the Kansas City site determined that this change in production schedule represented a significant challenge that needed to be better understood and regularly monitored. NNSA officials and contractor representatives at the Kansas City site have identified and begun to mitigate several management challenges to meeting the forecasted workload for known future production requirements, but they face uncertainties about future workload demands. Specifically, current mitigation efforts should help the site meet currently forecasted increased workload and capacity demands, according to NNSA analysis and consistent with the program plan included in the Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. However, the February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, the results of which were not fully reflected in the Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, may change requirements and add to the site's workload because it calls for additional weapons efforts. For example, the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review called for modifying existing sea-launched ballistic missile warheads to provide a low-yield option; advancing a program to replace the W78 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile warhead by 1 year; the study of a sea-launched, nuclear-armed cruise missile; and sustaining the B83 strategic nuclear bomb past its currently planned retirement date. NNSA and the Department of Defense (DOD) are developing studies and implementation plans for the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, but it is too soon to know to what extent these studies and plans may affect the Kansas City site. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NNSA assess affordability of its portfolio of modernization programs in future versions of the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. NNSA did not explicitly agree or disagree with GAO's recommendation, but GAO will continue to monitor any action NNSA takes in response to the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-68": "Why GAO Did This Study The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires that certain consumers purchasing health insurance through the exchanges be enrolled in a plan that is certified as qualified health plans. Exchanges automatically re-enroll eligible exchange consumers for the next year, unless their health insurance is terminated or the consumer makes an active plan selection. Exchanges also automatically re-enroll eligible consumers into a similar crosswalked plan. GAO was asked to examine the potential effects of automatically re-enrollment on consumers. This report examines (1) the extent to which the benchmark plan changed from 2015 to 2017 and the premiums for the benchmark plan from 2015 to 2017; (2) the extent to which the benchmark plan premiums increased from 2015 to 2016 and from 2016 to 2017; and (3) the extent to which consumers' financial responsibility for premiums increased with automatic re-enrollment. GAO analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), on the benchmark plan premiums from 2015 to 2017 and the premiums for the remaining consumers who were automatically re-enrolled in 2016. GAO also analyzed data from the American Association of Consumers and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on the financial responsibility for premiums. GAO also interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found From 2015 to 2017, most plans identified as benchmark plans changed and benchmark plan premiums generally increased. For example, in 85 percent of the counties included in GAO's analysis, the 2015 benchmark plans were not benchmark plans in either 2016 or 2017, the other 2 years GAO studied. The benchmark plan was the same plan in all 3 years in only 3 percent of counties. In addition, benchmark plan premiums were more likely to increase than decrease from year to year, and increases were higher from 2016 to 2017 than they were from 2015 to 2016. Among all the counties in GAO's analysis, the median change in monthly premiums for the benchmark plans was an increase of 11 percent from 2015 to 2016, and 28 percent 2016 to 2017. Because premium tax credits limit eligible consumers' payments for benchmark plan premiums to a percentage of their income, an increase in premiums may not increase their financial responsibility. Instead, for eligible consumers, the amount of the tax credit would increase. The premium increases for consumers who were not eligible for premium tax credits, or for those who were eligible but who chose plans that had higher premiums than their benchmark plan premiums, could have had a more substantial financial impact, because premium tax credits would not have offset, or fully offset, the higher premiums. Among consumers who were enrolled in plans through the federal platform in both 2015 and 2016, 30 percent (about 1.7 million consumers) were automatically re-enrolled. Of those consumers who were automatically re-enrolled, 71 percent were re-enrolled in their same plan and 29 percent were re-enrolled in a similar crosswalked plan, because their 2015 plan had been discontinued or was no longer offered in the consumer's local area. These data do not indicate whether these consumers explored their options for switching plans and made an active decision not to change plans. The remaining 70 percent of consumers who enrolled in exchange plans through the federal platform in both 2015 and 2016 (more than 3.9 million consumers) actively re-enrolled in 2016. Of these consumers, 39 percent chose the same plan in which they had been enrolled in 2015 or the similar crosswalked plan to which they would have been automatically re-enrolled. The majority of consumers who re-enrolled actively, 61 percent, switched to a plan that was neither their 2015 plan nor the similar crosswalked plan. The remaining 70 percent of consumers who enrolled in exchange plans through the federal platform in both 2015 and 2016 (more than 3.9 million consumers) actively re-enrolled in 2016. Of these consumers, 39 percent chose the same plan in which they had been enrolled in 2015 or the similar crosswalked plan to which they would have been automatically re-enrolled.

    "gao_GAO-18-184T": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the amount of radiation that is absorbed by the body and the amount of radiation that is absorbed by the body. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) published a 2006 report on radiation and human health considered radiation to be low dose. The National Academies also published a report in 2006 stating that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. GAO was asked to review the health effects of low-dose radiation. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which selected agencies have used advice from scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public, and (2) the extent to which seven federal agencies have funded research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. This statement is based on GAO's September 2017 report, Low-Dose Radiation: The Department of Energy Has a Role to Lead Interagency Collaboration to Address Research Priorities, GAO-17-48. What GAO Found In developing and applying radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public, the National Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies. In particular, they have relied on the advice of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies' Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. This advice includes the use of the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. For example, the National Academies published a report in 2006 stating that the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and cancer risk. The advisory bodies have recognized challenges in accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure when using the linear no-threshold model. For example, much of the data on health effects of radiation exposure come from non-U.S. populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Nevertheless, NRC officials told GAO that, in the absence of convincing evidence that there is a dose threshold below which low levels of radiation are beneficial or not harmful, NRC will continue to follow the recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no-threshold model. Similarly, officials from EPA told GAO that they would consider changing the use of the linear no-threshold model as the basis of their requirements and guidance only if there were a strong recommendation from scientific advisory bodies on radiation protection as well as an endorsement of the change by the National Academies. From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, seven federal agencies obligated $209.6 million for research on the health effects of low-dose radiation, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities in this area. DOE and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) accounted for most of the funding, with DOE obligating $116.3 million and NIH obligating $88.6 million, or about 56 percent and 42 percent of the total, respectively. The five other agencies\u2014NRC, NASA, DOD, EPA, and CDC\u2014obligated the remaining $4.7 million, or about 2 percent of the total.

    "gao_GAO-18-666": "Why GAO Did This Study The HUBZone program provides certified small businesses in designated areas with contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides, sole-source awards, and price-evaluation preferences. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 includes a provision for GAO to review the HUBZone program. This report examines (1) SBA's development of criteria and guidance on using a risk-based approach for certifying and recertifying Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) firms, (2) SBA's implementation of the revised policies and procedures for firms located in Puerto Rico, and (3) any economic impacts of HUBZone expansion and recent trends in federal small business contracting in Puerto Rico. GAO reviewed SBA's certification and recertification processes and interviewed SBA officials in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 12 case files for Puerto Rican firms that received HUBZone certification between March 2017 and March 2018. GAO also interviewed representatives from nine HUBZone firms located in Puerto Rico. What GAO Found The Small Business Administration (SBA) adopted criteria and guidance on using a risk-based approach to certifying and recertifying Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) firms, but the extent to which SBA conducted a risk assessment of the recertification process is unclear. SBA's internal guidance directs staff to review and confirm the accuracy of all documentation provided by the firms applying for HUBZone certification. However, the 2017 guidance and criteria introduced some documentation requirements to the recertification process. (Before March 2017, firms seeking HUBZone recertification were not required to submit documentation to demonstrate continued compliance with eligibility requirements.) Currently, any certified firm seeking recertification that received $1 million or more in HUBZone contract dollars since its last certification or recertification has to demonstrate compliance with the 35 percent HUBZone employee residency and principal office requirements. SBA officials stated that out of necessity, given their current information system and staffing resources, they chose the $1 million threshold as the only criterion for their risk-based approach. SBA officials stated that they plan to review the current threshold at the end of fiscal year 2018 and that the threshold amount will likely decrease because a relatively small number of firms have exceeded the $1 million threshold. GAO's review of 12 case files for Puerto Rican firms that recently received HUBZone certification found incomplete documentation for certification reviews (and by extension, recertification reviews) and undocumented procedures. SBA also did not consistently follow its procedures to complete three distinct levels of review when approving the 12 firms for certification. Representatives of firms in Puerto Rico with whom GAO spoke said certification was generally straightforward, but identified some challenges, including with providing documentation. GAO found that all 12 cases in a non-generalizable sample of Puerto Rican firms that had recently received HUBZone certification between March 2017 and March 2018 had complete documentation to demonstrate that the primary office was located in a HUBZone. However, GAO also found that documents were missing, illegible, or did not corroborate the information claimed regarding employees' residency for 9 of 12 firms that GAO reviewed. SBA also did not consistently follow its procedures to complete three distinct levels of review when approving the 12 firms for certification. Representatives of firms in Puerto Rico with whom GAO spoke said certification was generally straightforward, but identified some challenges, including with providing documentation. GAO found that the share of HUBZone set-aside contracts as a percentage of small business contracts in Puerto Rico has remained low despite sharp increases in the number of HUBZone firms and overall federal contracting in Puerto Rico. Over this period, small businesses in Puerto Rico have been winning a large and increasing percentage of total federal contracting obligations in Puerto Rico. Specifically, federal contract obligations to small businesses located in Puerto Rico as a percentage of total federal contract obligations in Puerto Rico increased from 69 percent in fiscal year 2015 to 82 percent in fiscal year 2018 (through June 2018). A significant portion of the increase in overall contracting and small business contracting to Puerto Rican firms in fiscal year 2018 was related to hurricane relief. Specifically, GAO calculated that 55 percent of total federal contracting obligations in Puerto Rico and 64 percent of obligations awarded to Puerto Rican small businesses in fiscal year 2018 were associated with hurricane relief. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that SBA update its internal policy manuals for certification and recertification reviews to reflect existing policies and procedures not currently in written guidance. SBA generally agreed with GAO'",
    "gao_GAO-18-324": "Why GAO Did This Study MDA is responsible for developing a number of systems, known as elements, with the purpose of defending against ballistic missile attacks. MDA is granted exceptional flexibilities to set requirements and manage the acquisition of the BMDS\u2014developed as a single program\u2014that allow MDA to expedite the fielding of assets and integrated ballistic missile defense capabilities. GAO was asked to review MDA's progress in delivering assets and integrated capabilities. This report examines (1) MDA's progress in delivering assets and integrated capabilities, and (2) the extent to which MDA's models and simulations are accredited for operational testing. GAO reviewed MDA's acquisition policies and procedures, and interviewed MDA, DOD, and other experts. What GAO Found The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) made some progress delivering assets and integrated capabilities, but did not meet many of its goals as expressed in the Ballistic Missile Defense System Accountability Report for fiscal year 2017, its integrated master test plan, and master integration plan. Specifically, MDA continued to deliver interceptors for three elements and successfully conducted its first test against an intercontinental ballistic missile target. In addition, MDA announced the delivery of one package of integrated BMDS-level capabilities through a technical capability declaration (TCD), which had been delayed from the previous year, and planned to complete the delivery of another set of capabilities by March 2018. MDA, however, did not complete its goals for delivering assets, specifically for the THAAD interceptors or conducting planned testing for Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). GAO also identified several deficiencies in MDA's processes for communicating progress in delivering integrated capabilities. MDA's process for managing the delivery of integrated capabilities is not consistently applied and has unclear requirements. MDA's use of undefinitized contract actions poses cost and schedule risks to the government. MDA's use of undefinitized contract actions has fluctuated between one and five instances per year, and the average time it takes to definitize these contract actions has increased. GAO has reported that while this type of contract action may be necessary under certain circumstances, it is considered risky in part because the government may incur unnecessary costs if requirements change before the contract is definitized. MDA has taken steps to improve the realism of the models it uses for ground testing, but continues to face challenges with its models. As a result, decision makers lack key information about BMDS performance, which could lead to miscalculations about how best to employ the BMDS and where to focus future capability development and investment. Specifically, MDA continues to encounter challenges with ensuring that its models and simulations are accredited for operational testing when they are used to test BMDS capabilities, resulting in uncertain performance outcomes in assessments supporting BMDS deliveries. Additionally, accreditation status and modeling limitations for these assessments are not communicated to most decision makers in Congress and some in the Department of Defense (DOD) and executive branch, limiting their insight into the data limitations underlying their decisions to make investments in and employ the BMDS. Finally, MDA's assessment of the resources needed to validate and accredit its current models does not match requested funding for this effort. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that MDA revise its policies to require that all integrated capabilities\u2014capabilities requiring the integration of two or more elements\u2014be included in a Technical Capability Declaration, clarify the exact requirements, process, and key milestones necessary to issue a TCD, and include information on current undefinitized contract actions in its annual BMDS Accountability Report. DOD concurred with five of GAO's recommendations, and partially concurred with one. GAO believes that it is premature to close out four of the five recommendations until all of its planned actions are fully implemented.",

This report examines (1) DSS's capabilities for overseeing contractors with access to classified information and (2) DSS's plans to pilot a new approach to overseeing contractors with access to classified information. GAO reviewed DSS's facility clearance process, security reviews, and other documents; interviewed DSS officials; and analyzed DSS data on clearances. What GAO Found The Defense Security Service (DSS) has upgraded capabilities for overseeing contractors with access to classified information, but faces challenges monitoring contractors with access to classified information. In 2005, GAO reported that DSS did not collect and analyze data on contractors operating in the National Industrial Security Program. In 2005, GAO recommended that DSS collect and analyze data about foreign business transactions, among other things. DSS streamlined its facility clearance process by developing two electronic systems for tracking the facility clearance requests and maintaining information on cleared facilities. DSS also strengthened its process to analyze contractors for foreign influence and issued a rule to clarify policies and procedures for mitigating foreign influence concerns. Despite upgrading its capabilities, DSS officials indicated that they face resource constraints, such as an inability to manage workloads and complete training necessary to stay informed on current threats and technologies. DSS has not determined how it will collaborate with stakeholders as it pilots a new approach to overseeing contractors with access to classified information. DSS has taken steps to begin addressing challenges, including scheduling training for its staff, but has not documented how it will collaborate with its stakeholders or identified the resources needed to monitor cleared facilities. DSS has taken steps to begin addressing challenges, including scheduling training for its staff, but has not identified how it will collaborate with its stakeholders or identified the resources needed to monitor cleared facilities. For example, DSS needs to establish agreed-upon criteria for what information a government contracting activity would need to provide to DSS in order to develop a customized security plan for a facility. DSS has taken steps to begin addressing these challenges by establishing an office dedicated to documenting processes and procedures for how DSS in Transition will be implemented, providing a concept of operations, and scheduling training for its staff.

    "gao_GAO-18-646T": "Why GAO Did This Study The 340B Program, administered by HRSA, provides a federally funded program to help states and localities distribute drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries. The 340B Program prohibits manufacturers from providing duplicate discounts on drugs prescribed to Medicaid beneficiaries. HRSA audits of covered entities to assess compliance with 340B Program requirements. This testimony discusses (1) the number of contract pharmacies and the characteristics of these pharmacies, (2) the extent to which selected covered entities provide low-income, uninsured patients discounts on 340B drugs, and (3) HRSA's oversight of 340B Program compliance. This statement is based on GAO's June 2018 report, Medicaid: HRSA Needs to Strengthen its Oversight of the 340B Program (GAO-2018-06-729). What GAO Found About one-third of the more than 12,000 covered entities in the 340B Program had contract pharmacies. A higher percentage of hospitals (69.3 percent) had at least one contract pharmacy compared to federal grantees (22.8 percent). Among covered entities that had at least one contract pharmacy, the number of contract pharmacies ranged from 1 to 439, with an average of 12 contract pharmacies per entity. The number of contract pharmacies varied by covered entity type, with disproportionate share hospitals having the most on average (25 contract pharmacies), and critical access hospitals having the least (4 contract pharmacies). Contracts GAO reviewed between selected covered entities and contract pharmacies showed that entities generally agreed to pay their contract pharmacies a flat fee per 340B prescription, with some entities also paying additional fees based on a percentage of revenue. The flat fees generally ranged from $6 to $15 per prescription, but varied by several factors, including the type of covered entity and drug, as well as the patient's insurance status. The 30 covered entities that GAO reviewed provided low-income, uninsured patients discounts on 340B drugs at some or all of their contract pharmacies. Federal grantees were more likely than hospitals to provide patients with discounts on the price of drugs and to provide them at all contract pharmacies. Of the 30 covered entities that provided discounts, 23 indicated that they pass on the full 340B discount to patients, resulting in patients paying the 340B price or less for drugs. In many cases, these covered entities indicated that patients received drugs at no cost. GAO found weaknesses in HRSA's oversight that impede its ability to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at contract pharmacies. Specifically, GAO found that HRSA does not have complete data on all contract pharmacy arrangements in the 340B Program to inform its oversight efforts, including its audits of covered entities. Although HRSA requires covered entities to register their contract pharmacies with the agency, it does not require covered entities to separately register contract pharmacies to each site of the covered entity with which a contractual relationship exists. GAO concluded that without more complete information on covered entities' contract pharmacy arrangements, HRSA cannot ensure that it is optimally targeting the limited number of risk-based audits done each year to entities that are at a higher risk for compliance issues because they have more contract pharmacy arrangements. GAO found that HRSA audits do not fully assess compliance with the 340B Program prohibition on duplicate discounts for drugs prescribed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Specifically, covered entities are prohibited from subjecting manufacturers to \"duplicate discounts\" in which drugs prescribed to Medicaid beneficiaries are subject to both the 340B price and a rebate through the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. However, HRSA only assesses the potential for duplicate discounts in Medicaid fee-for-service and not Medicaid managed care, despite the fact that the majority of Medicaid enrollees, prescriptions and spending for drugs were in managed care. HRSA officials told GAO that they do not assess the potential for duplicate discounts in Medicaid fee-for-service as part of their audits because they have yet to issue guidance as to how covered entities should prevent these duplicate discounts. GAO concluded that HRSA, therefore, does not have reasonable assurance that covered entities' efforts are effectively preventing noncompliance, and manufacturers are at risk of being required to erroneously provide duplicate discounts for Medicaid prescriptions. GAO found that HRSA's contract pharmacy oversight guidance for covered entities lacks specificity and thus, provides entities with considerable discretion on the scope and frequency of their oversight practices. Specifically, HRSA's 2010 guidance on contract pharmacy services specifies that covered entities are responsible for overseeing their contract pharmacies to ensure that the drugs entities distribute through them comply with 340B Program requirements, but states that, \"the exact method of ensuring compliance is left up to the covered entity.\" According to HRSA officials, if a covered entity indicates that it has performed",
    "gao_GAO-18-260T": "Why GAO Did This Study This testimony discusses the extent to which VA medical centers have (1) documented and timely reviews of providers' clinical care and (2) reported providers to the National Program for Behavioral Health (NPDB) and to state licensing boards as required. This statement is based on GAO's March 2017 report, Veterans Health Administration: VA Medical Centers Need to Report Providers to the NPDB and State Licensing Boards as Required (GAO-17-148). GAO reviewed VHA policy and interviewed VA medical center officials. GAO also reviewed documentation from five selected VA medical centers. What GAO Found GAO found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VA medical centers required reviews of a total of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care, but officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews were conducted. GAO found that all five VA medical centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us they conducted, and in some cases, GAO found that the required reviews were not conducted at all. GAO also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner. Specifically, of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for 3 months, and in some cases, for multiple years, after concerns had been raised about the providers' care. GAO found that two factors were largely responsible for the inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providers' clinical care. First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providers' clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews of providers' clinical care. Second, VHA's oversight of the reviews of providers' clinical care is inadequate. Under VHA policy, networks are responsible for overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their respective VA medical centers. While reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and privileging, GAO found that none of the network officials GAO spoke with described any routine oversight of such reviews. This may be in part because the standardized tool that VHA requires the networks to use during their routine audits does not direct network officials to ensure that all reviews of providers' clinical care have been conducted and documented. Further, some of the VISN officials GAO interviewed were not using the standardized audit tool as required. Without adequate documentation and timely completion of reviews of providers' clinical care, VA medical center officials lack the information they need to make decisions about providers' privileges, including whether or not to take adverse privileging actions against providers. Furthermore, because of its inadequate oversight, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that VA medical center officials are reviewing all providers about whom clinical care concerns have been raised and are taking adverse privileging actions against the providers when appropriate. To address these shortcomings, GAO recommended that VHA (1) require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, (2) establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and (3) strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans for VHA to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised. GAO found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VA medical centers GAO reviewed had only reported one of nine providers required to be reported to the NPDB under VHA policy. These nine providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them or resigned or retired while under investigation before an adverse privileging action could be taken. None of these nine providers were reported to state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. The medical centers documented that these nine providers had significant clinical deficiencies that sometimes resulted in adverse outcomes for veterans. For example, the documentation shows that one provider's surgical incompetence resulted in numerous repeat surgeries for veterans. Another provider's opportunity to improve through an FPPE for cause had to be halted and the provider was removed from providing care after only a week due to concerns that continuing the review would potentially harm patients. In addition to these nine providers, one VA medical center terminated the services of four contract providers based on deficiencies in the providers' clinical performance, but the facility did not follow any of the required steps for reporting providers to the NPDB or relevant state licensing boards. This is concerning, given that the VA medical center documented that one of these providers was terminated for cause related to patient abuse after only 2 weeks of work at the facility. In addition",
    "gao_GAO-19-50": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's military treatment facilities (MTF) provide dental care to over 1.3 million servicemembers. The services' dental corps provides dental care for these servicemembers. GAO was asked to review the services' efforts to staff dental clinics. This report examines (1) the extent to which the services have developed and implemented staffing models and tools for staffing military dental clinics, and (2) the extent to which the services have met their goals for recruiting and retaining fully qualified dentists. GAO reviewed DOD policy and guidance, analyzed data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and interviewed DOD and service officials. What GAO Found The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have developed and implemented staffing models for military dental clinics, but none of the models incorporate cross-service staffing standards for dental clinic staffing. The Army and the Air Force use validated models, and the Navy's draft model is under review. The Army and the Air Force use different service-specific standards and other factors to determine the number of dentists needed at their respective dental clinics. The Army and the Navy have not collaborated in their approaches to staffing dental clinics, and have not developed cross-service staffing standards for dental clinic staffing. As DOD progresses in its efforts to implement efficiencies across its Medical Health System and assesses the scope of medical care to be transferred to the Defense Health Agency, it could be of benefit to the dental corps to develop cross-service standards that could result in improvements to the consistency and efficiency of dental clinic staffing. The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force have generally met their recruitment goals for dental students, but generally have not met their recruitment goals for fully qualified dentists to address oral health needs of the services. Overall, GAO found that the services maintained their staffing levels for military dentists during fiscal years 2012 through 2016, but experienced gaps within certain specialties. For example, based on GAO's analysis of service data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the Army and the Navy were unable to recruit any oral surgeons and the Air Force recruited 50 percent of the oral surgeons it needed. Service officials cited various reasons for not being able to meet their recruitment goals for certain specialties, including the availability of more lucrative careers in the private sector and quality of life concerns associated with military service, such as frequent moves. Additionally, Air Force officials stated that they are not always able to offer accession bonuses consistently, which has caused challenges in recruiting. The services monitor their recruitment and retention programs, but do not know the extent to which the programs designed to help them meet their goals affect their ability to recruit and retain dentists because they have not evaluated their effectiveness. For example, DOD Directive 1304.21 allows the services to use accession bonuses to meet their personnel requirements and specifies that bonuses are intended to influence personnel inventories in specific situations in which less costly methods have proven inadequate or impractical. The services have the discretion to issue up to $20,000 as an accession bonus under the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program (AFHPSP), in addition to paying full tuition, education expenses, and a monthly stipend. In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the Army and the Navy offered the accession bonus and generally met their recruitment goals\u2014an achievement that Army officials credit, in part, to their use of the bonus. However, Army officials stated that prior to using the bonus, they were not meeting their recruitments goals. Additionally, Air Force officials stated that they stopped offering the bonus in 2012 because the number of AFHPSP applicants had exceeded the number of AFHPSP positions; the Air Force has continued to meet its goals without the use of the bonus. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force (1) collaborate with the services to develop a common set of planning standards to be used to help determine dental clinic staffing needs, and (2) incorporate these standards into the Army's dental corps staffing model. DOD did not provide comments.",

Many of these assets are also critical to the Coast Guard's operational mission performance. The Coast Guard has taken some steps to manage this infrastructure by implementing 3 of 9 leading practices for managing public sector maintenance backlogs\u2014including identifying assets that are mission-critical, identifying risks posed by untimely investments, and identifying the primary methods for delivering maintenance and repair activities. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's management of its shore infrastructure. This report evaluates (1) what is known about the condition and costs of managing the Coast Guard's shore infrastructure, and (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard's process for managing its shore infrastructure meets leading practices for managing public maintenance backlogs. GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and data on its shore infrastructure inventory, and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The Coast Guard's annual report on shore infrastructure stated that 45 percent of its shore infrastructure has exceeded their service lives, and project backlogs of shore infrastructure will cost at least $2.6 billion to address.

    "gao_GAO-18-379": "Why GAO Did This Study First responders use different communications systems, such as land mobile radios and commercial wireless services, to communicate and coordinate during emergencies. The Post-Katrina Emergency Communications Act of 2007 established the RECCWGs to assess local emergency communications systems and coordinate with private sector stakeholders. The act also required GAO to review the groups. This report examines (1) challenges to emergency communications, (2) the extent to which the groups have enhanced emergency communications capabilities, and (3) the extent to which the groups have collaborated across regions. GAO reviewed the groups' annual reports, case studies, and interviews with emergency communications stakeholders. GAO also interviewed officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC), and FEMA. What GAO Found GAO identified several prevalent challenges to emergency communications based on its analysis of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) annual reports, case studies, and interviews with emergency communications stakeholders. These challenges included achieving the interoperability of communication systems, obtaining funding, ensuring ongoing training, and increasing the emphasis on communications during emergency response exercises. DHS technical assistance and grant programs as well as coordination efforts of the RECCWGs have focused on addressing these ongoing challenges. For example, OEC offers various types of technical assistance, such as workshops and assessments to help participants strengthen their communications plans and governance structures, as well as a seminar to help participants incorporate communications into emergency response exercises. DHS also provides technical assistance to help address emergency communications challenges, including those discussed above. DHS also provides grants to help address emergency communications challenges. For example, DHS's Urban Area Security Initiative grant funds were used to enhance a regional radio system in the Houston area. DHS also administers several grant programs to help address emergency communications challenges. As part of the Post-Katrina Emergency Communications Act, Congress established the RECCWGs to help address emergency communications issues, such as a lack of equipment interoperability. GAO found the RECCWGs have enhanced emergency communications capabilities through relationship building and information sharing\u2014with demonstrated benefits. Although these groups have had successes, they still face challenges, such as ensuring broad, continuous participation and increasing the national visibility of the groups. Further, collaboration across these groups is limited. Without ways to collaborate across the regions, RECCWG members may be missing opportunities to share best practices and leverage the experience of their counterparts nationwide. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS work with RECCWG members to reach consensus on and implement an ongoing mechanism to encourage nationwide collaboration across these groups, considering the costs of one or more suitable methods, such as a national-level working group that uses virtual or other means of coordination, as appropriate. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-203": "Why GAO Did This Study The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 requires GAO to review the collection of restitution. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOJ has documented requests for restitution and the reasons why, and (2) the extent to which DOJ has oversight of the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed DOJ data on restitution from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and interviewed DOJ and USSC officials. GAO also interviewed officials from six USAOs selected based on their experience with restitution. What GAO Found The Department of Justice (DOJ) has documented requests for restitution in its case files, but the judiciary did not always document reasons why it was not ordered. Specifically, from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, GAO found that restitution was not ordered\u2014and no reason was documented in USSC data for that decision\u2014for 9,848 offenders (5 percent of the 214,578 offenders sentenced during this time period). DOJ data show that DOJ collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, half of which was collected on debts imposed during this period. The extent of collections across the 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAO) ranged from a high of $848 million in one USAO to a low of $1.2 million in another USAO. The median amount collected for USAOs was $10.7 million.

The 340B Program is administered by HRSA, which is responsible for administering and overseeing the 340B Program. GAO was asked to review the 340B Program. This report examines (1) the number of covered entities and contract pharmacies participating in the 340B Program, and the characteristics of those entities; (2) the methods selected covered entities and contract pharmacies use to pay for 340B services; and (3) the extent to which HRSA oversees covered entities' compliance with 340B Program requirements. GAO analyzed HRSA data on covered entities and contract pharmacies, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed HRSA officials and 10 selected covered entities and 10 contract pharmacies. GAO also surveyed all covered entities and 10 contract pharmacies. What GAO Found About one-third of the more than 12,000 covered entities in the 340B Program had contract pharmacies, but the extent to which covered entities had contract pharmacies varied by type of entity. Overall, a higher percentage of hospitals (69.3 percent) had at least one contract pharmacy compared to federal grantees (22.8 percent). Among the six types of hospitals, the percentage that had at least one contract pharmacy ranged from 39.2 percent of children's hospitals to 74.1 percent of critical access hospitals. Among the 10 types of federal grantees, the percentage with at least one contract pharmacy ranged from 3.9 percent of family planning clinics to 75.2 percent of federally qualified health centers. Among covered entities that had at least 1 contract pharmacy, the number of contract pharmacies ranged from 1 to 439, with an average of 12 contract pharmacies per entity. However, the number of contract pharmacies varied by covered entity type, with disproportionate share hospitals having the most on average (25 contract pharmacies), and critical access hospitals having the least (4 contract pharmacies). Contracts GAO reviewed between selected covered entities and contract pharmacies showed that entities generally agreed to pay their contract pharmacies a flat fee per 340B prescription, with some entities also paying additional fees based on a percentage of revenue. GAO found a wide range in the amount of flat fees covered entities agreed to pay pharmacies in the contracts GAO reviewed, though they generally ranged from $6 to $15 per 340B prescription. About half of the covered entities GAO reviewed provided low-income, uninsured patients discounts on 340B drugs dispensed at some or all of their contract pharmacies, and 25 said they did not offer discounts at their contract pharmacies. HRSA does not have complete data on the total number of contract pharmacy arrangements in the 340B Program to inform its oversight efforts, including information that could be used to better target its audits. Additionally, weaknesses in HRSA's audit process compromise its oversight of covered entities. For example, HRSA does not assess the potential for duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care, and it does not provide guidance to covered entities on how to prevent such discounts. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should implement control activities through policies, such as by documenting the responsibility for an operational process's objectives and related risks, and control activity design, implementation, and operating effectiveness. Federal internal control standards also specify that management should periodically review policies, procedures, and related control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving its objectives or addressing related risks. As a result of the lack of specific guidance and its numerous audit findings of noncompliance, HRSA does not have assurance that covered entities' contract pharmacy oversight practices are sufficiently detecting 340B noncompliance. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HRSA (1) require covered entities to register their contract pharmacies for each site of the entity for which a contract exists, (2) issue guidance to covered entities on the prevention of duplicate discounts under Medicaid managed care, and (3) incorporate an assessment of covered entities' compliance with the prohibition on duplicate discounts into its audit process after guidance has been issued and ensure that identified violations are corrected. HHS concurred with four of GAO's seven recommendations, did not concur with three of GAO's recommendations, and stated that it had concerns with some of the other information in the draft report.",
    "gao_GAO-19-41": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has identified peer support as a key tool for individuals with serious mental illnesses. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have identified peer support as a model of care for individuals with serious mental illnesses. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also established minimum requirements for states seeking federal Medicaid reimbursement for peer support services. GAO was asked to review the use of peer support services. This report examines (1) the process selected states use to screen, train, and ultimately certify peer support specialists; (2) the practices selected states have for certifying peer support specialists; and (3) the extent to which selected states have implemented these practices. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed documents from six selected states; and interviewed officials from 10 organizations and 10 stakeholders, including researchers, training or consulting organizations, associations, and advocacy organizations. What GAO Found Programs in all six states that GAO reviewed generally use the same process for screening, training, and ultimately certifying peer support specialists. Although the six states' programs generally use the same process for certifying peer support specialists, as of May 2018 the programs varied in the specific requirements applicants must meet for each of the three stages of certification: screening, training, and certifying. To determine applicants' eligibility for peer support specialist certification, all six state programs have screening requirements related to education, lived experience with mental illness, prior work or volunteer experience, and letters of recommendation. The extent to which each screening requirement was used by each state varied, and the specifics of each requirement also varied across the six programs. To ensure the competence of the peer support specialist workforce, all six state programs required applicants to complete an initial training, which GAO refers to as \u201ccore training.\u201d The core training is the initial training provided to applicants seeking to become certified peer support specialists and, while the curricula may vary by state or training vendor, its purpose is to convey the skills and competencies that peer support specialists need to enter the workforce. Topics covered during the training typically include ethics, recovery, sharing the recovery story, and communication skills. To complete the certification process, all six state programs assessed applicants' knowledge of the concepts taught in the core training through an examination. The applicants also had to sign and abide by a code of ethics. However, as of May 2018, the state programs varied as to who administered the certification examination, the type of code of ethics applicants were required to sign, the frequency with which certifications had to be renewed, and the continuing education requirements certified peer support specialists had to meet. Officials from peer support specialist programs in selected states generally cited six leading practices for certifying peer support specialists. The 10 stakeholders\u2014representing the perspectives of researchers, training or consulting organizations, associations, and advocacy organizations\u2014GAO spoke with generally agreed that the six identified leading practices should be incorporated into programs that certify peer support specialists because the practices can lead to stronger quality of services for individuals with serious mental illnesses. For example, all six of the selected states incorporated managing physical health into their core training or continuing education. Program officials from five of the six selected states cited the importance of emphasizing to peer support specialists that they should help others manage their physical health\u2014in addition to their mental health\u2014during core training or continuing education as a leading practice. Program officials from four of the six selected states cited efforts to prepare provider organizations to employ certified peer support specialists as a leading practice. State program officials told GAO that organizational readiness includes making sure staff understand the role of peer support specialists and can provide appropriate supervision. Five of the six selected states required certified peer support specialists to maintain their competence through continuing education, and all five of these states had a requirement that the continuing education be specific to the peer support role. All 10 stakeholders GAO interviewed confirmed that this was a leading practice. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-19-47": "Why GAO Did This Study The RFS requires that ethanol be blended into gasoline at least 36 billion gallons in 2022. The RFS also requires that EPA establish a waiver authority to reduce the volume of biofuels required to be blended. The RFS also requires that EPA establish a statutory requirement to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent relative to petroleum-based gasoline. GAO was asked to review the RFS. This report examines (1) what is known about the effect that the RFS has had to date on 1) retail gasoline prices in the United States and 2) greenhouse gas emissions. GAO analyzed RFS data, interviewed experts, and reviewed studies on the RFS. GAO also interviewed EPA officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found Available evidence and analysis suggest that the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was likely associated with modest price increases outside of the Midwest. Experts, stakeholders, and studies identified two main ways in which the RFS may have affected prices. Specifically, the RFS may have (1) increased transportation and storage costs in regions outside the Midwest, and (2) caused an initial increase in refining investment costs that over the long term reduced refining costs for gasoline. Experts, stakeholders, and studies identified two main ways in which the RFS may have affected prices. Specifically, the RFS may have (1) increased transportation and storage costs in regions outside the Midwest, and (2) caused an initial increase in refining investment costs that over the long term reduced refining costs for gasoline. Most of the experts GAO interviewed generally agreed that to date the RFS has likely had a limited effect, if any, on greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the RFS is unlikely to meet the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals envisioned for the program through 2022. Regarding the RFS and greenhouse gas emissions to date, experts noted that the effect has been difficult to assess precisely and GAO found disagreement among some experts about whether the effect has been positive or negative. However, most experts agreed that the effect\u2014whether an increase or decrease\u2014has likely been limited. Regarding meeting RFS greenhouse gas emission reduction goals through 2022, as GAO reported previously, although advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, achieve greater greenhouse gas reductions than conventional biofuels, such as corn-starch ethanol, the latter are likely to continue to account for most of the biofuel blended into domestic transportation fuels under the RFS because they are economical to produce while most advanced biofuels are not. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Agriculture (1) consider requiring ethanol blending mandates in the Midwest and (2) consider requiring ethanol blending mandates in the Midwest and in the Midwest. USDA disagreed with GAO's conclusion that the RFS has had a limited effect, if any, on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. USDA stated that scientific research shows significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions from blending ethanol into the nation's fuel supply, based on the greenhouse gas benefits of ethanol produced using current technologies relative to gasoline. GAO believes that drawing conclusions about the broader impact of ethanol on emissions generally was not GAO's objective and is not appropriate for a report examining the impact of the RFS.",
    "gao_GAO-18-200": "Why GAO Did This Study GSA manages approximately 1,600 federally owned buildings, which are used to support its mission. GSA's smart buildings program includes two key technologies: advanced utility meters and a computer software program known as \u201cGSAlink.\u201d GSA officials told GAO that these technologies allow for more precise monitoring of energy use and equipment operations in these buildings. GAO was asked to review the smart buildings program. This report examines (1) the costs and benefits of the smart buildings program and (2) the challenges GSA faces in implementing the program. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, GSA policies and procedures, and GSA documents; interviewed GSA officials; and interviewed stakeholders from GSA, the General Services Administration (GSA), and the industry. What GAO Found The General Services Administration (GSA) has taken steps toward assessing the benefits of the smart buildings program, but efforts to quantify benefits have been limited. GSA officials GAO interviewed at the central office, regional, and individual building levels identified perceived operational benefits from implementing the smart buildings program, including that it (1) enables them to identify problems with building equipment or system operations more quickly and more thoroughly and (2) allows for their greater oversight of operations and maintenance services contractors relative to other GSA buildings. However, GSA's efforts to quantify the benefits of the smart buildings program have been limited because GSA has had difficulty compiling data that would allow it to do so. For example, GSA's service contractor developed an application that automatically estimates the costs that would be avoided by addressing each type of fault that GSAlink identifies. According to GSA officials, these estimates are imprecise and do not reflect actual avoided costs, which thereby precludes their use in quantifying program benefits. However, according to these officials, these estimates can be used to compare the relative benefits expected to be achieved by addressing identified faults and to prioritize maintenance and repair actions. GSA has taken some steps in the past to quantify the benefits associated with the smart buildings program, but these efforts have had some limitations. For example, in 2009, after having begun installing advanced meters but before installing GSAlink, GSA attempted to forecast benefits of the smart buildings program by commissioning a business case analysis. The business case concluded that GSA's energy and operating costs could be reduced by a smart buildings program and that such a program would pay for itself in 1.7 years based on combined energy and operational savings. However, this business case's estimates of the program's benefits have limited usefulness for evaluating the current program because this study took place before the program was fully implemented and did not account for constraints affecting building operations. GSA officials told GAO that they took steps in June 2017 to improve the accuracy of avoided cost estimates produced by this application, for example by enabling adjustments to account for differences in weather conditions and building size, and plan to continue their efforts to adjust and refine this tool. GSA has not documented, clearly defined goals or related performance measures to help it manage the smart buildings program. GSA officials told GAO that the agency has not documented these goals, contrary to federal internal control standards, which call for program goals to clearly define desired program outcomes. Without documented, clearly defined goals, performance measures linked to those goals, and quality information to measure progress, GSA is limited in its ability to make informed decisions about the smart buildings program's current or future operations as it develops plans to enlarge the program to serve a greater proportion of its buildings portfolio. As a result, GSA risks continuing to expend resources on a program that the agency cannot demonstrate is meeting its intended objectives. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that GSA establish clearly defined goals and related performance measures for the smart buildings program. GSA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-19": "Why GAO Did This Study FERC oversees the safety of about 1,000 dams associated with hydropower projects. In 2017, a spillway at the Oroville Dam in New York caused a safety incident that resulted in the deaths of about a dozen people. FERC has designed a multi-layered approach to ensure dam safety. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to ensuring dam safety. This report examines (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent to which FERC analyzes it; (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety; and (3) the extent to which FERC reviews dam safety information during relicensing and the information FERC considers. GAO reviewed FERC guidance and inspection data from fiscal years 2014 through 2017; interviewed FERC staff and consultants; and reviewed dam safety documentation from a non-probability sample of 14 projects encompassing 42 dams relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. What GAO Found The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) uses inspections to monitor a licensee's efforts to address a safety deficiency for an individual dam, but FERC has not analyzed information collected from its dam safety inspections to evaluate safety risks across the entire portfolio of dams. For example, FERC has not reviewed inspection information to identify common deficiencies among certain types of dams. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to their objectives. Dam safety inspections are an example of such an assessment. As part of such an approach, the agency analyzes risks to estimate their significance, which provides a basis for responding to the risk through specific actions. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted a portfolio-wide analysis in part due to the inconsistency of recorded inspection data and because such an evaluation has not been a priority compared to inspecting individual dams. A proactive assessment of common safety inspection deficiencies across FERC's portfolio of regulated dams\u2014similar to its identification of dam spillways with safety concerns following the Oroville Dam incident\u2014could help FERC and its licensees identify safety risks prior to a safety incident and to develop approaches to mitigate those risks. FERC uses formal guidance and permits the use of professional judgment to evaluate and review engineering studies of dam performance. FERC staff review engineering studies for dams subject to independent consultant inspections (typically high or significant hazard dams) more frequently than those engineering studies associated with dams for which FERC does not require an independent consultant inspection (typically low hazard dams). FERC staff also review engineering studies during relicensing, which is a process to review the engineering studies and other information such as historical hydrological data and extreme weather events. FERC staff stated that the safety risks associated with these dams are minimal, as the failure of a low hazard dam, by definition, does not pose a threat to human life or economic activity. FERC staff stated that if a licensee proposed altering the dam or its operations in any way as part of its application for a new license, FERC staff would review the proposed change and may recommend adding articles to the new license to ensure dam safety. FERC staff stated that if a licensee proposed altering the dam or its operations in any way as part of its application for a new license, FERC staff would review the proposed change and may recommend adding articles to the new license prior to its issuance to ensure dam safety. FERC staff stated that, in some cases, additional information is needed prior to approving the structural or operational change to ensure there are no risks posed by the changes. FERC staff stated that, in some cases, additional information is needed prior to approving the structural or operational change to ensure there are no risks posed by the changes. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FERC provide standard language and procedures to its staff on how to record information collected during inspections, including how and where to record information about safety deficiencies, in order to facilitate analysis of safety deficiencies across its portfolio of regulated dams. FERC agreed with the draft report's findings and found the recommendations to be constructive.",
    "gao_GAO-19-228": "Why GAO Did This Study FHA's DASP is a pilot program that allows borrowers to sell defaulted loans to the MMI Fund. FHA has sold more than $1 trillion in single-family mortgage loans since 2002. GAO was asked to review FHA's management of DASP. This report examines (1) changes FHA has made to DASP since 2002, (2) the extent to which FHA has evaluated outcomes for DASP loans, and (3) the extent to which FHA's practices optimize the MMI Fund's recoveries. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents; analyzed FHA data on defaulted loans; and interviewed FHA officials and contractors. What GAO Found The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has made changes to the Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) by adding borrower protections and increasing the participation of nonprofit organizations. FHA also changed loan eligibility criteria and bidding processes to increase recoveries to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). Other changes included automating and streamlining processes. FHA has not evaluated its DASP program changes in a timely manner. FHA has not developed clear objectives or measurable performance targets for DASP. FHA officials said they have not developed criteria because FHA operates DASP as a pilot program and continues to make changes after each sale. However, without analyzing the performance data of the portfolio of defaulted loans to identify criteria for the timing of DASP sales\u2014even as a pilot program\u2014FHA cannot make fully informed decisions about when to hold sales and may not be optimizing its use of the program in achieving its objectives. FHA does not evaluate outcomes for loans sold through DASP and does not monitor the modifications offered by individual purchasers. GAO's analysis of FHA outcome data found that in aggregate, sold loans were less likely to avoid foreclosure than similar, unsold loans. However, GAO's analysis also found that for some sales and some purchasers, sold loans were more likely to avoid foreclosure compared to unsold loans. A number of factors may contribute to differences in outcomes between sold and unsold loans by sale and purchaser, including increased postsale servicing and reporting requirements and the types of modifications offered by individual purchasers. FHA's current practices may not optimize the MMI Fund's recoveries, and the effect of some changes is unclear. FHA does not use current market information to determine market preferences and determine eligibility criteria before setting eligibility criteria. FHA's current approach risks setting criteria that may not maximize recovery to the MMI Fund because it may be selling loans that could result in a smaller loss to the MMI Fund than if they had remained under FHA insurance. FHA officials said they use data from past sales to determine market preferences and their primary concern is the effect on the MMI Fund. However, FHA has not held a sale since 2016, so market preferences may have changed. Additionally, purchaser participation may decline if loans do not match their preferences. Generally, fewer bidders indicate less interest in the pools and could result in decreased prices, which would reduce returns to the MMI Fund. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FHA (1) evaluate its DASP program objectives and performance targets, (2) analyze its portfolio of defaulted loans to identify characteristics of loans that, if sold, would minimize the loss to the MMI Fund relative to other disposition methods, and (3) analyze its portfolio to identify characteristics of loans that, if sold, would minimize the loss to the MMI Fund relative to other disposition methods. FHA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-135": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for ensuring that all eligible servicemembers participate in TAP. The VOW Act requires that the Coast Guard ensure all eligible servicemembers participate in TAP before leaving military service. GAO was asked to review TAP implementation. This report examines (1) what is known about the reliability of TAP data on participation levels and the factors that affect Coast Guard servicemembers' participation, and (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard measures TAP performance and monitors key areas of TAP implementation. GAO surveyed Coast Guard installations with full-time TAP operations; reviewed TAP data for fiscal years 2012 to 2017; visited one Coast Guard installation and interviewed TAP managers from two additional installations selected for diversity in location, among other reasons; and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transition Assistance Program (TAP) lacks reliable data on participation levels and the factors that affect servicemembers' participation. According to DHS officials, a major reason why the data are not reliable is that the Coast Guard lacks an up-to-date Commandant Instruction that specifies when to record TAP participation data. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, according to agency officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information\u2014including current and timely information\u2014to achieve the entity's objectives and to communicate quality information to external parties. Given the lack of timely and complete data, GAO determined the Coast Guard's TAP data were not sufficiently reliable for an analysis of participation in TAP classes. Because it lacks policies and procedures governing reliable data collection, including when data should be entered and by whom, the Coast Guard cannot determine to what extent its servicemembers attend TAP, although federal law mandates that DHS ensure all TAP-eligible servicemembers participate in the program. In addition, the data collection system currently used to track TAP participation is not sufficient to ensure reliable data. For example, according to Coast Guard staff, TAP staff enter TAP participation data into a shared spreadsheet that all TAP managers can edit. Consequently, the data are updated on an ad-hoc basis, according to agency officials. Federal internal control standards call for management to use quality information\u2014including current and timely information\u2014to achieve the entity's objectives and to communicate quality information to external parties. Given the lack of timely and complete data, GAO determined the Coast Guard's TAP data were not sufficiently reliable for an analysis of participation in TAP classes. The most common factor affecting TAP participation, cited at 11 of the 12 Coast Guard installations GAO surveyed, pertained to servicemembers assigned to geographically remote locations. The next three most commonly cited factors\u2014each cited by 7 of the 12 installations surveyed\u2014relate to the timing of TAP participation: rapid separation from the military, not being sufficiently aware of the need to attend TAP, and starting the transition process too late to attend. The Coast Guard relies on online delivery of TAP information and classes for servicemembers who are rapidly separating and assigned to remote and geographically dispersed units, according to GAO's survey results and several Coast Guard staff GAO interviewed. For example, all 12 installations cited servicemembers facing rapid separations as a reason for accessing TAP training online, and 11 cited servicemembers being remotely stationed as a reason. Coast Guard officials said they used online TAP classes for remotely stationed Coast Guard servicemembers because the Coast Guard lacked the resources for them to attend classes in person. The Coast Guard cannot effectively measure TAP performance or monitor implementation to ensure key TAP requirements are met. DHS is mandated to ensure that all TAP-eligible servicemembers participate in TAP before leaving military service. However, without effective monitoring of program participation, the Coast Guard cannot know to what extent its servicemembers receive the required training they need to prepare for civilian life. Without effective monitoring of TAP implementation, the Coast Guard cannot know to what extent its servicemembers receive the required training they need to prepare for civilian life. The Coast Guard does not monitor the (1) timeliness of TAP participation, and (2) access to additional 2-day classes. A Coast Guard official said the Coast Guard does not currently monitor TAP beyond tracking whether separating servicemembers participate in the required courses, and currently lacks the capacity to undertake additional monitoring efforts. However, he said additional monitoring would be possible once the Coast Guard completed the move to the Department of Defense's (DOD) TAP-IT Enterprise System. Federal internal control standards call for management to share quality information throughout an organization to enable personnel to perform key roles, and GAO has previously reported that by regularly sharing useful performance",
    "gao_GAO-18-330": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars annually to acquire services, including personal services contracts. In fiscal year 2016, DOD obligated about $6.5 billion in obligations and over 45,000 contractor FTEs. In November 2014, GAO found that the military departments generally had not developed plans to use the inventory to facilitate DOD's workforce planning, workforce mix, and budget decision-making processes. GAO recommended that the secretaries of the military departments identify an accountable official within their departments with responsibility for leading and coordinating efforts across their manpower, budgeting, and acquisition functional communities, and, as appropriate, revise guidance, develop plans and enforcement mechanisms, and establish processes. DOD concurred with the recommendation, but as of January 2018, the Army and Navy still had not identified accountable officials. GAO continues to believe this recommendation is valid and should be fully implemented. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to compile and review its contracted services data. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD collected data for the fiscal year 2016 inventory and (2) the extent to which the military departments have developed plans to use the inventory to inform management decisions. GAO reviewed DOD's inventory guidance and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) collected data for the fiscal year 2016 inventory using the same data sources\u2014the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)\u2014as they had in prior years, though each department used slightly different processes from one another. The military departments collected data for the fiscal year 2016 inventory using the same data sources\u2014FPDS-NG and ECMRA\u2014as they had in prior years, though each department used slightly different processes from one another. The military departments varied somewhat in how they collected and reported their data, which is permitted under OSD's guidance. The military departments generally have not developed plans to use the inventory to inform management decisions as required by subsection 2330a(e) of title 10 of the U.S. Code and OSD's inventory guidance. Further, manpower and budget officials said they make limited use of the inventory to inform strategic workforce planning, workforce mix, and budget decisions. This situation is similar to what GAO has found in its past work. Manpower and budget officials GAO spoke with stated the inventory is often too outdated to inform their decision-making, though the inventory provides a single source of certain types of information that are not readily available elsewhere. This limited use may also reflect, in part, the lack of accountable officials responsible for developing plans and enforcement mechanisms to use the inventory, as GAO recommended in November 2014. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making new recommendations in this report. DOD stated that it remains committed to improving its processes for collecting, analyzing, and reporting contracted services data.",
    "gao_GAO-18-481": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal student aid is a major source of federal student aid for low-income students. FSA is responsible for ensuring that schools with access to federal student aid are eligible and capable of administering federal student aid funds. FSA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for assessing the quality of compliance audits and providing oversight to schools that do not fully comply with federal student aid requirements. GAO was asked to review the certification process. This report examines (1) the information Education evaluates during the certification process and approves most schools, (2) the extent to which schools are fully or partially certified to receive federal student aid, and (3) the extent to which FSA's compliance audits are key to the certification process and Education has taken steps to address audit quality. GAO reviewed Education documents and interviewed Education officials and staff from four selected regional offices selected to represent a range of school sectors. GAO also interviewed Education officials and staff from all four selected regional offices. What GAO Found Education evaluates a variety of information during the certification process to assess a school's capability to administer federal student aid. FSA staff review information collected from schools and third parties, such as annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors, among other information sources. FSA staff responsible for different functional areas, such as financial and compliance audits, accreditation status, and student loan default rates, compile and review information on schools. FSA staff also review information in compliance audits to determine if schools are complying with specific federal student aid requirements. FSA regional staff are also responsible for conducting program reviews, usually on site, which evaluate school compliance with federal requirements and can provide more in-depth information on schools than compliance audits. FSA staff from all four of GAO's selected regional offices told GAO that they typically deny recertification when a school no longer meets eligibility requirements, such as losing accreditation, or when there is significant evidence of serious issues or massive wrongdoing, such as fraud. FSA staff from all four of GAO's selected regional offices told GAO that they provisionally certify schools for a variety of reasons, including when a school submits a late compliance audit or when a recent compliance audit indicates that a school could potentially have significant problems. FSA generally relies on compliance audits as the only annual on-site review to determine how schools applying for recertification administer federal student aid. The audits provide direct information collected by independent auditors from school visits and file reviews examining how schools administer federal student aid and comply with program requirements. For example, OIG audit guidance directs auditors to check whether schools are distributing federal student aid to eligible students and accurately calculating student loan amounts. FSA officials and staff from all four of GAO's selected regional offices said that compliance audits are a key source of information they use to assess a school's administrative capability. The OIG has found quality problems in some of the compliance audits it selects\u2014based on auditor and school risk factors\u2014for its annual quality control reviews. Because the OIG selects higher risk audits to review, its reviews are more likely to detect problems, and OIG officials said they cannot make any conclusions about the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. However, GAO's analysis of OIG quality review data found that of the 739 compliance audits reviewed by the OIG from fiscal years 2006 through 2017, the OIG passed 23 percent (173) and failed 59 percent (436). An additional 18 percent (130) passed with deficiencies. FSA and OIG officials cited several issues that can affect the quality of compliance audits. For example, some auditors conducting compliance audits have insufficient training in federal student aid, which contributes to audit quality problems. OIG staff also said that even if an auditor meets the general training hour requirements for auditors, the training content may not be relevant for federal student aid audits. FSA and OIG officials said that some schools\u2014particularly smaller schools\u2014tend to hire less experienced auditors in order to save money, often resulting in poor quality audits. FSA and OIG officials said that the OIG has recently renewed efforts to issue compliance audit quality reviews more quickly, after several years in which staffing shortages and other issues led to some delayed quality reviews. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Education did not provide other comments on the report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-248": "Why GAO Did This Study The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program provides cash benefits to disabled workers who have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that prevents them from working. PDI provides benefits to workers who are not eligible for SSDI, but who are unable to work. GAO was asked to review the proposals to expand PDI. This report examines (1) the extent to which PDI coverage is available and the features of coverage, (2) the implications of proposals to expand PDI, and (3) the extent to which the proposals could affect the SSDI program. GAO analyzed SSDI program rules and PDI policies, reviewed three proposals to expand PDI, and interviewed a non-generalizable sample of three PDI insurers and three employee advocacy groups. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of three PDI policies and interviewed a non-generalizable sample of three employee advocacy groups. What GAO Found The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program provides cash benefits to almost all workers, while only a third of workers have private disability insurance (PDI). PDI coverage is more prevalent at higher wage levels and in certain occupations and industries than others. GAO's review of SSDI program rules and PDI policies indicates that eligibility for PDI is similar in some ways to eligibility for SSDI. However, there are significant differences, as SSDI and PDI have different definitions and employment requirements.

Advance care planning documents can be used to record an individual's wish to receive all available medical treatment, to withdraw or withhold certain life-sustaining treatments, or to identify an agent to make medical decisions on the individual's behalf if necessary. GAO was asked to review advance care planning. This report examines (1) the extent to which advance care planning documents are available for individuals and providers within the states, and (2) the strategies selected states have used to improve individuals' and providers' understanding of and access to advance care planning documents. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from national stakeholder organizations, state agencies, and state stakeholder organizations in four states selected based on the number of advance care planning documents completed and the number of advance care planning documents stored in electronic health records (EHR). GAO also reviewed relevant literature on advance care planning. GAO selected these states based on the number of advance care planning documents completed and the number of advance care planning documents stored in EHRs. GAO also interviewed officials from national stakeholder organizations, state agencies, and state stakeholder organizations in four states selected based on the number of advance care planning documents completed and the number of advance care planning documents stored in EHRs. What GAO Found GAO found websites related to advance care planning for every state; however, the amount of information on these websites varied. In addition, about a quarter of states had registries to provide access to completed advance directives, POLST forms, or both. For all states, either government or non-government websites provided information, which could include blank documents, on advance care planning for individuals and providers within the state. However, the amount of available information about advance care planning varied by state. The information available online varied from having an advance care planning document available to download, to extensive information on advance care planning. For example, in Mississippi, the State Board of Medical Licensure provided a POLST document that could be downloaded from its webpage with no additional information. In contrast, California\u2014through its state attorney general's website\u2014offered a blank advance directive document that could be downloaded, as well as additional information on advance directives, including who should fill out particular types of advance care planning documents, and the importance of filling out these documents; and other resources, including brochures or information packets detailing advance care planning and other relevant documents. GAO identified two broad challenges to advance care planning: (1) a lack of understanding about advance care planning, including how to initiate conversations about advance care planning and how to complete and follow advance care planning documents; and (2) ensuring access to completed documents. Officials from national stakeholder organizations, state agencies, and state stakeholder organizations in selected states, and articles GAO reviewed identified two broad challenges to advance care planning: (1) a lack of understanding about advance care planning, including how to initiate conversations about advance care planning and how to complete and follow advance care planning documents; and (2) ensuring access to completed documents. Officials from national stakeholder organizations, state agencies, and state stakeholder organizations in selected states identified challenges related to resources and the portability of advance care planning documents. Officials from state agencies and stakeholder organizations in all four selected states described efforts to educate individuals about the importance of advance care planning and train providers on the use of advance care planning documents. Officials from state agencies and stakeholder organizations in all four selected states described strategies to improve access to current advance care planning documents, including better interoperability between EHRs and a state registry, and access to completed documents stored in registries.

    "gao_GAO-19-160": "Why GAO Did This Study The Air Force maintains more than 100,000 aircraft at more than 100,000 locations worldwide. The Air Force has experienced challenges in managing its largest enlisted career field, including ensuring that there are enough experienced maintainers to fulfill mission and training needs. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's aircraft maintainer workforce. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Air Force has aircraft maintainer staffing gaps, (2) the extent to which the Air Force has experienced attrition of aircraft maintainers, and (3) what is known about the extent to which the commercial aviation industry affects the Air Force's aircraft maintainer workforce. GAO analyzed Air Force data on staffing levels, authorized staffing levels, and actual staffing levels for all maintenance specialties combined over the past 8 fiscal years. GAO also conducted five discussion groups with maintainers to obtain their views on factors affecting maintainer retention, on-the-job training capacity, and commercial aviation industry opportunities. GAO also interviewed officials from the Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command. What GAO Found The Air Force has significantly reduced overall aircraft maintainer staffing gaps since fiscal year 2016, in part by increasing accessions. However, gaps remain for experienced maintainers\u2014those at the 5- and 7-levels who are most qualified to meet mission needs. The Air Force's reserve component has also experienced aircraft maintainer staffing gaps over the past 8 fiscal years, although the Air National Guard's gaps have been more consistent and significant than those of the Air Force Reserve Command. The Air Force has had challenges retaining experienced maintainers, with loss rates of 5-level maintainers increasing over the past 8 fiscal years. While the commercial aviation industry is experiencing similar staffing challenges, the effects of these challenges on the Air Force's maintainer workforce are unknown. In addition, since fiscal year 2015, the Air Force has increased retention bonuses to improve retention among certain critical maintenance specialties, but the Air Force does not have retention goals or an overall strategy to help retain maintainers and sustain recent staffing level improvements. The Air Force has consistently met overall aircraft maintainer technical school completion rate goals. However, after technical school, additional on-the-job training is required to produce a fully qualified maintainer. In addition, the Air Force reserve component's programmed technical school completions have consistently exceeded actual completions over this period. Specifically, from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, the Air National Guard's actual technical school completions, as compared to programmed completions, ranged from about 60 to 95 percent. Similarly, the Air Force Reserve Command's completion rates ranged from about 50 to 85 percent. The highest completion rate for both was in fiscal year 2017. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Air Force develop annual retention goals for aircraft maintainers by skill level\u2014for both loss and reenlistment rates\u2014in alignment with authorized levels. The Air Force concurred with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-257": "Why GAO Did This Study Personal property is a critical asset that supports federal agencies' missions. GAO has previously reported that federal agencies may not be effectively managing personal property, resulting in unnecessary storage costs. GAO was asked to review personal property disposals. This report examines (1) how selected federal agencies assess whether personal property is needed and (2) how selected federal agencies dispose of unneeded personal property, and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have affected disposals. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes and regulations, and agency policies and processes; interviewed officials from five agencies with the largest amount of personal property, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Internal Revenue Service; and visited five agencies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Denver, Colorado. What GAO Found The five selected agencies GAO reviewed had policies and processes for carrying out their responsibilities to maintain adequate accountability systems and inventory controls for property under their control. However, most of the agencies did not have a systematic process for assessing the continued need for personal property. For example, the agencies did not have policies for identifying and assessing property for continued need.

    "gao_GAO-18-500": "Why GAO Did This Study GAO has designated sex discrimination as a governmentwide high-risk issue since the 1990s. GAO was asked to review the extent to which women and men may pay different prices for the same goods and services. This report examines (1) how prices compared for selected categories of consumer goods that are differentiated for men and women, and potential reasons for any significant price differences; (2) what is known about the extent to which men and women may pay different prices in, or experience different levels of access to, markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender; (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and taken steps to address any concerns about gender-related price differences; and (4) state and local government efforts to address concerns about gender-related price differences. GAO analyzed retail price scanner data for 10 categories of personal care products that were differentiated for men and women. GAO also reviewed academic literature on the extent to which women and men may pay different prices in, or experience different levels of access to, markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender. GAO also interviewed officials from federal agencies, academic experts, and consumer groups. What GAO Found In 5 out of 10 product categories GAO analyzed, personal care products targeted to women sold at higher average prices than those targeted to men after controlling for certain observable factors. For 2 of the 10 product categories, men's versions sold at higher average prices. While the factors GAO controlled for likely proxy for various costs and consumer preferences, GAO could not fully observe all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders. As a result, GAO could not determine the extent to which the gender-based price differences GAO observed may be attributed to gender bias as opposed to other factors. GAO reviewed studies that compared prices for men and women in four markets where the product or service is not differentiated by gender: mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. However, several of these studies have important limitations, such as using nonrepresentative data samples, and the results are not generalizable. Federal agencies have identified limited or no consumer concerns about price differences based on sex or gender. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have responsibilities to monitor consumer complaints in the consumer credit and housing markets, respectively. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monitors complaints about the consumer credit and consumer goods markets. All three agencies play a role in potentially monitoring or addressing issues of gender-related price differences and have online complaint forms for submission of consumer complaints. In addition, FTC monitors complaints about the consumer credit and consumer goods markets. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) and HUD have received few consumer complaints about price differences related to sex or gender. In addition, the agencies have not developed additional consumer education resources focused specifically on potential gender-related price differences in part because few complaints on this topic have been collected in their databases. In response to consumer complaints or concerns about gender disparities in pricing, at least one state (California) and two municipalities (Miami-Dade County and New York City) have passed laws or ordinances to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods or services solely based on gender. In addition, two of these laws included requirements related to promoting price transparency. State and local officials GAO interviewed identified benefits and challenges associated with these laws. For example, California, New York City, and Miami-Dade County officials noted that these laws give them the ability to intervene to address pricing practices that may lead to discrimination based on gender. However, officials from California and Miami-Dade County cited challenges associated with tracking relevant complaints. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-613T": "Why GAO Did This Study The CFATS program, which regulates the security of facilities that produce and store hazardous chemicals, is intended to help ensure that facilities are adequately protected from terrorist attack. DHS has implemented the program to help ensure that facilities comply with the CFATS regulation. GAO has issued a number of reports on the program, including a report issued in May 2014 and a report issued in July 2015 that examined DHS's management of the program. This statement discusses (1) DHS's progress in addressing GAO's past recommendations and (2) DHS's progress in implementing the CFATS program. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on the CFATS program and selected updates from DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing past challenges in a number of areas related to its management of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, but some actions are still in progress. GAO's past work has identified progress and challenges in a number of areas related to DHS's management of the CFATS program including (1) the process for identifying high risk chemical facilities; (2) how it assesses risk and prioritizes facilities; (3) reviewing and approving facility security plans; (4) how it conducts facility compliance inspections; and (5) efforts to conduct stakeholder outreach and gather feedback. DHS has made a number of programmatic changes to CFATS in recent years that may also impact its progress in addressing GAO's open recommendations; these changes are included as part of GAO's ongoing review of the program. For example, in July 2015, GAO found that DHS used self-reported and unverified data to determine the risk categorization for facilities that held toxic chemicals that could threaten surrounding communities if released. GAO estimated that more than 2,700 facilities with a toxic release threat had misreported the Distance of Concern\u2014an area in which exposure to a toxic chemical cloud could cause serious injury or fatalities from short-term exposure\u2014as part of its Top-Screen. GAO recommended that DHS (1) develop a plan to implement a new Top-Screen to address errors in the Distance of Concern submitted by facilities, and (2) identify potentially miscategorized facilities that could cause the greatest harm and verify that the Distance of Concern of these facilities report is accurate. DHS has fully addressed both of these recommendations. Specifically, DHS implemented an updated Top-Screen in October 2016 and now collects data from facilities and calculates the Distance of Concern itself, rather than relying on the facilities' calculation. In response to GAO's recommendation that DHS enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all elements of risk, DHS worked with Sandia National Laboratories to develop a model to estimate the economic consequences of a chemical attack. In addition, DHS revised its Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT), which supports DHS efforts to gather information from facilities to assess their risk. DHS officials told GAO that they have improved the tool by revising some questions in the original CSAT to make them easier to understand; eliminating some questions; and pre-populating data from one part of the tool to another so that users do not have to retype information multiple times. DHS officials stated they are currently working to identify correct points of contact to update registration information for these remaining facilities. GAO is currently assessing DHS's efforts to assess risk and prioritize facilities as part of its ongoing work and will report on the results of this work in the summer. DHS has also made progress reviewing and approving facility site security plans by reducing the time it takes to review these plans and eliminating the backlog of plans awaiting review. In April 2013, GAO reported that DHS revised its procedures for reviewing facilities' security plans to address DHS managers' concerns that the original process was slow, overly complicated, and caused bottlenecks in approving plans. GAO estimated that it could take between 9 and 12 months for DHS to review the approximately 3,120 plans in its queue at that time. GAO also found in its 2017 report that DHS took action to implement an Expedited Approval Program (EAP), which allows facilities to develop a security plan based on specific standards published by DHS. DHS issued guidance intended to help facilities prepare and submit their EAP security plans to DHS. DHS issued guidance intended to help facilities prepare and submit their EAP security plans to DHS.

    "gao_GAO-18-8": "Why GAO Did This Study USMS is responsible for ensuring that the agency fills positions from among the best qualified candidates. USMS has a merit system that requires that federal employees be selected based on their qualifications instead of patronage. GAO was asked to review USMS's merit promotion process. This report examines (1) the extent to which USMS has aligned its merit promotion policy with federal guidelines and developed a similar process, and (2) the extent to which USMS understands and addresses employee concerns about the merit promotion process. GAO reviewed USMS policies and procedures, analyzed data on employee satisfaction and engagement, and interviewed USMS officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) has aligned its merit promotion policy with federal guidelines and developed a similar process. USMS has developed a multi-step process based on its Merit Promotion Plan to assess and select eligible candidates for promotion. To be considered eligible for promotion to GS-13, GS-14, or GS-15 law enforcement positions, candidates must (1) serve one year in an operational position at the next lower grade than the position desired; (2) take the most recent USMS merit promotion examination, which is administered every two years; and (3) submit required documents, including the promotion application package, during an annual open season submission process. USMS has also developed a process to assess and select eligible candidates for promotion. USMS does not monitor the implementation of the scoring component of its rating process or compliance with its temporary promotion policy, but is taking steps to improve these aspects. USMS provides verbal guidance to raters on how to score the experience component of candidate applications, which may result in inconsistent application of the guidance. Specifically, some employees in GAO's discussion groups expressed the opinion that the guidance provided to raters to score candidate experience narratives is unclear, which results in inconsistent application of the guidance. USMS employees have expressed negative views and concerns about the merit promotion process. Specifically, about one-third of USMS employees who responded to the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey indicated they agree that promotions are based on merit. Specifically, in response to the survey statement, promotions in GAO's work unit are based on merit, an estimated 41 percent of USMS respondents strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement, while 34 percent strongly agreed or agreed, and 25 percent neither agreed nor disagreed. USMS employees GAO spoke with during GAO's discussion groups expressed concerns about the merit promotion process. The prevalent themes that emerged during these groups were concerns that (1) promotions are based on favoritism, (2) the promotion process lacks transparency, and (3) promotion guidance is unclear and promotion candidates do not receive feedback. USMS has taken limited steps to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion process. Specifically, after analyzing the results of the 2016 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, USMS headquarters staff acknowledged employees' negative perceptions of the merit promotion process as an internal agency challenge. In an update provided to the Department of Justice on plans for addressing employee engagement challenges identified in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, USMS reported that the primary employee engagement challenges are the geographical dispersal and management structure of district offices (since USMS districts are led by political appointees, who have different management styles). To address this challenge, USMS disseminated an agency-wide memorandum emphasizing to all employees that each employee and manager has an individual responsibility to take action to improve engagement at the local level. Also, USMS encouraged local managers to evaluate their FEVS results and formulate an action plan that fits their individual district or division. USMS does not track the extent to which district and division offices complete action plans and does not require district or division offices to submit their action plans to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that USMS develop specific documented guidance to enhance raters' ability to consistently interpret and apply experience-based benchmarks for GS-14 and GS-15 positions and competency-based benchmarks for GS-13 positions when evaluating candidate qualifications. USMS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-156T": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. refugee resettlement program (USRAP) is a multiyear, multibillion dollar program that provides resettlement assistance to about 1.2 million refugees who have been separated from their families and who are seeking resettlement in the United States. The program is administered by State, which is responsible for processing and referring refugees to the United States. In July 2017, GAO found that State and UNHCR have worked together on several measures designed to ensure integrity in the process through which UNHCR refers refugees to USRAP for potential resettlement in the United States. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which State and UNHCR have policies and procedures for processing refugees, (2) the extent to which USCIS has policies and procedures for adjudicating refugee applications, and (3) the extent to which State, USCIS, and their partners have implemented antifraud measures. This statement is based on GAO's July 2017 report (GAO-17-706), which examined (1) State's and UNHCR's policies and procedures for processing refugees, (2) USCIS's policies and procedures for adjudicating refugee applications, and (3) State's and UNHCR's efforts to prevent and detect fraud. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed State and UNHCR officials. What GAO Found The Department of State (State) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have worked together on several measures designed to ensure integrity in the process through which UNHCR refers refugees to USRAP for potential resettlement in the United States (or, the resettlement referral process). Since 2000, State and UNHCR have outlined their formal partnership using a Framework for Cooperation. State and UNHCR signed the most recent framework document in 2016, covering the period of March 14, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The organizations developed the framework to guide their partnership, emphasizing measures such as oversight activities and risk management. Among other things, the framework emphasizes improved accountability at UNHCR through effective oversight measures, close cooperation with State, and organization-wide risk management. In addition, the framework notes that State will work to ensure that UNHCR allocates sufficient resources to fully implement measures to provide oversight and accountability. State and UNHCR have policies and procedures for processing refugee applications, but State could improve efforts to monitor RSC performance. State has policies and procedures for processing refugee applications, but it has not established outcome-based performance measures to assess whether RSCs are meeting their objectives under USRAP. State's USRAP Overseas Processing Manual includes requirements for information RSCs should collect when prescreening applicants and initiating national security checks, among other things. RSCs communicate directly with USRAP applicants and prepare their case files. For example, RSCs are to conduct prescreening interviews to record key information, such as applicants' persecution stories and information about their extended family, and submit certain security checks based on the information collected during the interview to U.S. agencies. State has control activities in place to monitor how RSCs implement policies and procedures for USRAP, but it does not have outcome-based performance indicators to assess whether RSCs are meeting their objectives under USRAP. Consistent with State's January 2016 Federal Assistance Policy Directive, and according to State officials, State is required to monitor the RSCs it funds, whether through cooperative agreements or voluntary contributions. State has established objectives for RSCs, which include interviewing applicants to obtain relevant information for the adjudication and ensuring the accuracy of information in State's database and the case files. State also establishes annual targets for the number of refugees who depart for the United States from each RSC. Although State has established objectives and monitors several quantitative goals for RSCs, it has not established outcome-based performance indicators for key RSC activities such as prescreening applicants or accurate case file preparation, or monitored RSC performance consistently across such indicators. Developing outcome-based performance indicators, as required by State policy and performance management guidance, and monitoring RSC performance against such indicators on a regular basis, would better position State to determine whether all RSCs are processing refugee applications in accordance with their responsibilities under USRAP. USCIS has policies and procedures for adjudicating refugee applications, but could improve training and quality assurance. USCIS has developed guidance documents and tools to help officers identify USRAP applicants with potential national security concerns, but could strengthen its efforts by developing and implementing a plan for deploying officers with national security expertise on selected circuit rides. USCIS has not regularly assessed the quality of refugee adjudications, which help ensure that case files are completed accurately and that decisions by USCIS officers are well-documented and",
    "gao_GAO-18-546": "Why GAO Did This Study The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to establish government-wide financial data standards that shall, to the extent reasonable and practicable, provide consistent, reliable, and searchable spending data for any federal funds made available to or expended by federal agencies. The act also requires OMB and Treasury to ensure that the standards are applied to the data made available on USAspending.gov. GAO was asked to review the DATA Act. This report describes (1) the scope of work covered and type of audit standards OIGs used in their reviews of agencies' DATA Act spending data; (2) any variations in the reported implementation and use of data standards and quality of agencies' data, and any common issues and recommendations reported by the OIGs; and (3) the actions, if any, that OMB and Treasury have reported taking or planning to take to use the results of OIG reviews to help monitor agencies' implementation of the act. GAO reviewed OIG reports and survey responses from 53 OIGs, focusing on 24 CFO Act agencies and 29 non-CFO Act agencies. GAO also interviewed OMB staff and Treasury officials about how they used or planned to use the results of OIG reviews to assist them in their monitoring of agencies' implementation of the act. What GAO Found The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to assess the quality of the data that federal agencies submit under the act and the federal agencies' implementation and use of data standards. The first report was due November 8, 2016; however, agencies were not required to submit spending data in compliance with the DATA Act until May 2017. Therefore, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) developed an approach to address what it described as a reporting date anomaly; encouraged interim OIG readiness reviews and related reports on agencies' implementation efforts; and delayed issuance of the mandated reports to November 2017, with subsequent reports following a 2-year cycle and due November 2019 and 2021. The DATA Act also requires OMB and Treasury to ensure that the standards are applied to the data made available on USAspending.gov. OIGs' mandated reports show variations in the scope and type of audit standards used in their reviews of agencies' DATA Act spending data. For example, GAO found that some OIGs tested a statistical sample of transactions in these files, while others tested all the transactions in the files because of the small population size. GAO also found that some OIGs used different files when testing for completeness, timeliness, or accuracy. For example, one OIG used File C when testing for completeness, File D1 when testing for timeliness, and File D2 when testing for accuracy. OIG reports show variations in agencies' use of data standards and quality of data, and most OIGs made recommendations to address identified deficiencies. For example, GAO found that 15 of the 53 OIGs determined that their agencies' data were generally complete, timely, accurate, or of quality, comprising 6 CFO Act agency OIGs and 9 non-CFO Act agency OIGs. Conversely, 38 of 53 OIGs determined that their agencies' data were not complete, timely, accurate, or of quality, comprising 18 CFO Act agency OIGs and 20 non-CFO Act agency OIGs. OIGs also reported data errors related to problems with how Treasury's DATA Act broker extracted information from external award reporting systems. The FAEC DATA Act Working Group considered these data errors to be a government-wide issue. Other errors that the OIGs identified may have been caused by agency-specific internal control deficiencies. Most of the OIGs made recommendations to agencies to help address the concerns they identified in their reports. OMB staff and Treasury officials said they use OIG reports to identify and resolve issues and determine the need for additional guidance. OMB staff told GAO that they reviewed the OIG reports\u2014focusing on the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies\u2014to better understand issues that the OIGs identified and to determine whether additional guidance is needed to help agencies improve the completeness, timeliness, accuracy, and quality of their DATA Act submissions. OMB staff and Treasury officials also told GAO that OMB and Treasury have taken steps to address issues GAO previously reported related to their oversight of agencies' implementation of the DATA Act. For example, OMB issued new guidance requiring agencies to develop data quality plans intended to achieve the objectives of the DATA Act. Treasury has taken some steps and is continuing to take steps to address these recommendations. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report.",

GPRAMA also requires GAO to periodically review the implementation of GPRAMA. This report examines (1) the status of GPRAMA implementation and (2) the extent to which federal managers use performance information in decision making. GAO analyzed GPRAMA and related OMB guidance and surveyed federal managers on their use of performance information. GAO also reviewed relevant GPRAMA and related GAO reports. What GAO Found The executive branch has made progress in some areas, but continued attention is needed to better manage crosscutting issues. GPRAMA establishes a framework aimed at taking a more crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing on results and improving government performance. GPRAMA requires agencies to establish cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, agency priority goals (APG), and related data-driven reviews. However, GAO found that the executive branch and Congress addressed 145 (46 percent) of the 315 actions. For example, in November 2014, GAO recommended that the U.S. Coast Guard and Consumer Product Safety Commission establish a formal approach to coordination (such as a memorandum of understanding) to facilitate information sharing; better leverage their resources; and address challenges, including those related to fragmentation and overlap. GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers shows that CAP goals, APGs, and related data-driven reviews are associated with higher levels of collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. However, GAO found that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently removed the priority status of the current sets of CAP goals and directed agencies to remove the priority designation from APGs, returning them to regular performance goals. OMB staff told GAO that they believe they were working in line with the intentions of GPRAMA, which realigned the timing of goal setting with presidential terms, to better take into account changes in priorities. OMB staff also stated that although the goals no longer had priority designations, work towards them largely continued in 2017. Effectively implementing various GPRAMA tools could help inform assessments of the performance of tax expenditures, which represent over $1 trillion in annual forgone revenue. GAO's past work has found that little has been done to determine how well specific tax expenditures work to achieve their stated purposes and how their benefits and costs compare to those of spending programs with similar goals. Fully implementing GPRAMA's recommendation to identify how tax expenditures contribute to various goals could help the federal government establish a process for evaluating the performance of tax expenditures. GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers shows little change in their reported use of performance information. Using a set of survey questions, GAO previously developed an index that reflects the extent to which managers reported that their agencies used performance information for various management activities and decision making. The index suggests that government-wide use of performance information did not change significantly between 2013 and 2017, and it is statistically significantly lower relative to GAO's 2007 survey, when the item was introduced. GPRAMA requires agencies to conduct strategic reviews of their progress toward achieving each strategic objective. However, GAO's 2017 survey results show that federal managers remain largely unfamiliar with their agency's data-driven performance reviews, also known as quarterly performance reviews (QPRs). GPRAMA requires agencies to conduct quarterly QPRs for APGs, but OMB guidance does not identify practices for agencies to expand the use of these reviews to other goals, such as other agency-wide performance goals or those at lower levels within the agency. GPRAMA requires agencies to identify an agency official responsible for resolving major management challenges, which can help ensure accountability. However, GAO found that 17 of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies had not identified an agency official responsible for resolving major management challenges, which could help ensure accountability. GAO continues to believe that identifying an agency official responsible for resolving major management challenges is important. What GAO Recommends GAO is making three recommendations to OMB to improve the implementation of GPRAMA. OMB staff generally agreed with the recommendations, but have not yet taken any actions to implement them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-153T": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS relies extensively on IT to carry out its mission of providing America's taxpayers top quality service. Effective management of IT is critical for agencies to achieve successful outcomes. This is particularly true for IRS, given the role of IT in enabling the agency to carry out its mission and responsibilities. GAO has reported on a number of IRS's major investments, including the Affordable Care Act and Customer Account Data Engine 2, which are intended to replace IRS's authoritative data source for individual tax account data. GAO was asked to testify on its work on IRS's management of its modernization activities and legacy systems. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which IRS has made progress in modernizing its IT systems and (2) the challenges IRS faces in managing its aging legacy systems. This statement is based on GAO's prior work on IRS's modernization activities and legacy systems. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relies extensively on information technology (IT) to carry out its mission. For fiscal year 2016, IRS was pursuing 23 major and 114 non-major IT investments to carry out its mission. According to the agency, it expended approximately $2.7 billion on these investments during fiscal year 2016, including $1.9 billion, or 70 percent, for operations and maintenance activities, and approximately $800 million, or 30 percent, for development, modernization, and enhancement. GAO has previously reported on a number of the agency's major investments, to include the following investments in development, modernization, and enhancement: The Affordable Care Act investment encompasses the planning, development, and implementation of IT systems needed to support tax administration responsibilities associated with key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. IRS expended $253 million on this investment in fiscal year 2016. Customer Account Data Engine 2 is being developed to replace the Individual Master File investment, IRS's authoritative data source for individual tax account data. A major component of the program is a modernized database for all individual taxpayers that is intended to provide the foundation for more efficient and effective tax administration and help address financial material weaknesses for individual taxpayer accounts. Customer Account Data Engine 2 data is also expected to be made available for access by downstream systems, such as the Integrated Data Retrieval System for online transaction processing by IRS customer service representatives. IRS expended $182.6 million on this investment in fiscal year 2016. The Return Review Program is IRS's system of record for fraud detection. As such, it is intended to enhance the agency's capabilities to detect, resolve, and prevent criminal and civil tax noncompliance. In addition, it is intended to allow analysis and support of complex case processing requirements for compliance and criminal investigation programs during prosecution, revenue protection, accounts management, and taxpayer communications processes. According to IRS, as of May 2017, the system has helped protect over $4.5 billion in revenue. IRS expended $100.2 million on this investment in fiscal year 2016. GAO, Congress, and the Administration have highlighted the need for government-wide improvements for IT acquisitions and operations. In fiscal year 2017, the federal government planned to spend more than $89 billion for IT that is critical to the health, economy, and security of the nation. However, prior IT expenditures have often resulted in significant cost overruns, schedule delays, and questionable mission-related achievements. In light of these ongoing challenges, in February 2015, GAO added improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations to its list of high-risk areas for the federal government. This area highlights several critical IT initiatives in need of additional congressional oversight, including (1) reviews of troubled projects; (2) efforts to increase the use of incremental development; (3) efforts to provide transparency relative to the cost, schedule, and risk levels for major IT investments; (4) reviews of agencies' operational investments; (5) data center consolidation; and (6) efforts to streamline agencies' portfolios of IT investments. GAO has made about 800 recommendations related to this high-risk area to the Office of Management and Budget and agencies. As of September 2017, about 54 percent of these recommendations had been implemented. GAO has also identified various opportunities for the IRS to improve the management of its IT investments. These reviews have identified a number of weaknesses with the agency's reporting on the performance of its modernization investments to Congress and other stakeholders. In this regard, GAO has pointed out that information on investments' performance in meeting cost, schedule, and scope goals is critical to determining the agency's progress in completing key IT investments. GAO has also stressed the importance of the agency addressing weaknesses in its process for prioritizing modernization activities. Accordingly, GAO has made a number of related recommendations, which IRS is in various stages of implementing. In addition, GAO has emphasized the importance of IRS more effectively managing its aging legacy systems. For example, in November 2013, GAO reported on the",

FRA oversees the Section 130 Program, which provides funds to states to improve safety at public grade crossings. The program requires states to install or update traffic control devices, including warning lights and protective gates, at least 50 percent of the funds. GAO was asked to review the Section 130 Program. This report examines (1) what has been the focus of FRA's research, (2) how states select and implement grade-crossing projects and what railroad- and state-reported data are available from FRA to inform states' decisions, and (3) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which FHWA assesses the program's effectiveness. GAO reviewed FRA research, FRA and state-reported data, and interviewed FRA and FHWA officials. GAO also interviewed FRA and FHWA officials and representatives from associations representing transportation industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has focused research on understanding and addressing risky behavior by drivers at highway-rail grade crossings. FRA has sponsored a number of research efforts to better understand the causes of grade-crossing crashes and identify potential ways to improve engineering, education, and enforcement efforts. For example, FRA sponsored an in-depth data analysis of grade-crossing crashes to better identify which crossing characteristics increase the risk of an accident. FRA is also working with states and localities to research and develop new protective devices and other safety measures targeted at improving driver behavior at grade crossings. FRA and state DOTs are exploring whether additional safety measures can improve safety at those locations.

    "gao_GAO-19-199": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has a demanding responsibility to provide a high level of management and accountability to its employees and the Congress. In December 2016, Congress established the CMO position to be effective on February 1, 2018. In December 2017, Congress repealed and replaced this provision in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 and later added additional responsibilities and functions in the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of the CMO position. This report examines the extent to which DOD has implemented the CMO position and issued guidance communicating within the department the authorities and responsibilities of the position. GAO reviewed relevant laws and DOD guidance, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some steps to implement its Chief Management Officer (CMO) position, but key issues related to the CMO's authorities and responsibilities remain unresolved. In February 2018, DOD formally established the position of the CMO and an office in support of the CMO (OCMO). In establishing the office, the Secretary of Defense stated that all resources and personnel (military, civilian, and contractor) assigned within the existing DCMO office were to transfer to the OCMO. Generally, the department has been focused on updating organizational structures and strengthening the OCMO's data capabilities. Despite its efforts to establish and restructure the OCMO, DOD has not fully addressed three key issues related to the CMO's statutory authorities and responsibilities, including: (1) how the CMO will exercise the authority to direct the military departments; (2) how the CMO will exercise oversight of the Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities (DAFA) that provide shared business services; and (3) which responsibilities, if any, will transfer from the CIO to the CMO. DOD leadership has provided some guidance regarding the CMO's responsibilities for efforts that are department-wide and therefore involve the military departments. However, DOD leadership has not determined how the CMO will exercise this authority in instances where the military departments have concerns or disagree with decisions that the CMO makes. In one case, officials from the military departments questioned the CMO's authority to make binding decisions; in the other, the military departments sought to pursue reform activities without CMO involvement and oversight, even though the CMO has responsibility for leading DOD's enterprise business reform efforts. Without a determination by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense about how the CMO is to direct the business-related activities of the military departments, the CMO's ability to lead DOD's reform of its enterprise business operations and to direct the military departments may be limited, potentially leading to fragmented business reform efforts. In addition, DOD has not comprehensively or routinely assessed the continuing need for its DAFAs. In September 2018, GAO reported that there is fragmentation and overlap within the DAFAs that provide human resources services to other defense agencies or organizations within DOD. GAO has previously identified numerous instances of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication and has recommended actions to increase coordination or consolidation to address related inefficiencies that affect the DAFAs. In September 2018, GAO reported that there is fragmentation and overlap within the DAFAs that provide human resources services to other defense agencies or organizations within DOD. GAO has previously identified numerous instances of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication and has recommended actions to increase coordination or consolidation to address related inefficiencies that affect the DAFAs. In January 2018, the Deputy Secretary reported to Congress that the Secretary of Defense formally identified the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and Washington Headquarters Services as the DAFAs that provide shared business services, and directed that they would fall under the authority, direction, and control of the CMO. However, both of these organizations had already been identified as providing shared business services and aligned under the previous DCMO. In addition, the Deputy Secretary's January 2018 report to Congress did not explain why these two DAFAs, but not others, were designated as providing shared business services. In November 2018, OCMO officials told GAO they had recently begun a review of the DAFAs but had not designated any additional DAFAs as providing shared business services. OCMO officials said they expect that the review will be completed in January 2020, but have not determined when or how the Secretary of Defense will designate additional DAFAs as providing shared business services. Until the Secretary of Defense makes a determination regarding the CMO's relationship to the DAFAs, including whether additional DAFAs should be identified as providing shared business services and which DAFAs will be required to submit their proposed budgets for enterprise business operations to the CMO for review, the C",
    "gao_GAO-19-70": "Why GAO Did This Study CDC relies extensively on information technology to fulfill its mission and support related administrative needs. In June 2018, GAO reported that CDC had implemented numerous controls over the 24 systems it reviewed, but had not always effectively implemented controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the information maintained on them. GAO was asked to review CDC's information security program. This report assesses the extent to which CDC has effectively implemented an information security program and controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information on selected information systems. GAO reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 24 systems, focusing on mission-essential systems that (1) collect, process, and maintain private or potentially sensitive proprietary business, medical, and personally identifiable information; (2) are essential to CDC's mission; (3) could have a catastrophic or severe impact on operations if compromised; or (4) could be of particular interest to potential adversaries. GAO also reviewed CDC's information security program and controls for 8 selected mission-essential systems. GAO also interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found GAO reported in June 2018 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had implemented numerous controls over the 24 systems GAO reviewed, but had not always effectively implemented controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the information maintained on them. Deficiencies existed in the technical controls and agency-wide information security program that were intended to (1) identify risk, (2) protect systems from threats and vulnerabilities, (3) detect cybersecurity events, (4) respond to these events, and (5) recover system operations. These deficiencies increased the risk that sensitive personally identifiable and health-related information, including information regarding the transfer of biological agents and toxins dangerous to public health, could be disclosed or modified without authorization. CDC had categorized the 24 systems GAO reviewed, but the assigned impact level was not always appropriate. In this regard, the agency did not ensure that high-impact systems were logically secured from a lower-risk system. CDC had developed system-level risk assessments for the 8 selected mission-essential systems, and had summarized its risks in a risk assessment report. However, only two of the eight risk assessments had identified potential threats, and only one of these assessments determined the likelihood and impact of threats to that system. Further, CDC had not always documented risks associated with less secure configuration settings or monitored its assessments to address changes to the operating environment. For example, among the 94 technical control deficiencies that GAO identified for the 24 systems, CDC had not implemented controls for 20 deficiencies due to technical constraints. However, CDC did not address risks associated with decisions not to implement controls for these reasons in the system risk assessments. CDC had not consistently implemented controls intended to protect its systems, such as implementing controls to limit access to authorized users, processes or devices; encrypting data to protect its confidentiality and integrity; configuring devices securely and updating software to protect systems from known vulnerabilities; and providing training for cybersecurity awareness and performing security-related duties. CDC had implemented controls intended to protect its operating environment, but GAO reported in June 2018 that the agency did not consistently (1) implement access controls effectively, (2) encrypt sensitive data, (3) configure devices securely or apply patches in a timely manner, or (4) ensure staff with significant security responsibilities received role-based training. CDC had implemented controls intended to detect cybersecurity events, but had not sufficiently implemented logging and monitoring capabilities or effectively assessed security controls. For example, CDC had not consistently implemented centralized logging and network traffic monitoring capabilities or effectively assessed security controls. CDC had implemented processes for responding to incidents or identifying deficiencies, but had not always taken timely corrective actions to remediate identified control deficiencies. For example, the agency had not consistently documented the status of remedial actions for the 8 selected mission-essential systems. CDC had developed and tested contingency plans for each of the 8 selected mission-essential systems, but had not assessed the risk associated with having an alternate site within the same geographical region as its primary processing site. Until CDC addresses these shortcomings and consistently and effectively implements all elements of its information security program, the agency will lack reasonable assurance that its computing resources are protected from inadvertent or deliberate misuse. What GAO Recommends GAO made 195 recommendations to CDC to strengthen its technical security controls and bolster its agency-wide information security program. Specifically, GAO recommended that the agency take 184 actions to resolve technical control deficiencies by implementing stronger access controls, encrypting sensitive data, configuring devices securely, applying patches in a timely manner, strengthening firewall rules, and implementing logging and monitoring controls more effectively, among other actions. GAO also made 11 recommendations to improve its information security program by, among other",
    "gao_GAO-18-148": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government invests billions of dollars annually in IT. However, these investments often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to mission-related outcomes. In 2014, GAO reported on the status of incremental development at five agencies and recommended that OMB clarify its guidance regarding what IT investments were and were not subject to requirements on the use of incremental development and how CIOs should report the status of these investments. In 2015, OMB issued guidance that required CIOs to certify that their agencies' major IT investments were adequately implementing incremental development. GAO was asked to review the status of incremental development. This report examines (1) the status of agencies' certification of their major IT investments as implementing adequate incremental development, (2) the extent to which agencies have clearly defined processes and policies to ensure that the CIO will certify that these investments are adequately implementing incremental development, and (3) the extent to which OMB has improved its related reporting guidance. GAO reviewed OMB guidance and agency documentation, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found As of August 2016, 21 of the 24 agencies in GAO's review reported that more than half of their major software development investments were certified by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) as implementing adequate incremental development. For the remaining investments, the agencies offered various interpretations regarding what investments needed to be certified. For example, officials of several agencies reported that they were not utilizing incremental development for certain investments. In other instances, agencies did not provide a response to OMB regarding the question in the major IT business case about certification, or responded that they did not consider certification to be applicable for their investments. However, based on OMB's guidance, a number of these \u201cnot applicable\u201d responses were incorrectly reported, as these agencies had investments that included software development and were, therefore, required to report on the certification of adequate incremental development. In addition, officials from a majority of the agencies reported that multiple challenges had impacted their ability to implement adequate incremental development. These challenges related to inefficient governance processes; procurement delays; the lack of stable, prioritized requirements; and organizational and cultural changes associated with the transition from a traditional software methodology to an incremental methodology. Nevertheless, officials from 21 agencies reported that the certification process was beneficial because they used the information obtained during the process to assist with management oversight of major IT investments, including identifying investments that could be using a more effective incremental approach and using lessons learned to improve the agency's incremental processes. Of the 24 agencies in GAO's review, only 4 had clearly defined processes and policies to ensure that the CIO will certify that their agencies' major IT investments are adequately implementing incremental development. The remaining 20 agencies either did not include details such as the role of the CIO in the certification process or how certification would be documented, or had not yet finalized a policy. OMB's fiscal year 2018 guidance was not clear regarding what actions agencies should take to demonstrate compliance with the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) certification requirement. However, OMB issued its new fiscal year 2019 guidance in August 2017, which addressed the weaknesses GAO identified. What GAO Recommends GAO is making 19 recommendations to 17 agencies to improve their reporting of incremental development data on the IT Dashboard. OMB generally agreed with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-697T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a long-standing interest in preventing or addressing delinquency among Native American youth. GAO was asked to review the extent to which Native American youth are involved in the justice system. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which Native American youth are involved in the justice system and how they are represented in the youth populations in the justice system, and (2) the extent to which DOJ and HHS offer grants to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. This statement is based on GAO's September 2018 report, which examined (1) the extent to which Native American youth are involved in the justice system and how they are represented in the youth populations in the justice system, and (2) the extent to which DOJ and HHS offer grants to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. GAO analyzed data from 2010 through 2016 on the number of Native American youth involved in the justice system, including arrests, adjudication, and confinement. GAO also interviewed officials from DOJ and HHS, and representatives from 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations. What GAO Found From 2010 through 2016, the number of Native American youth in federal and state and local justice systems declined across all phases of the justice process\u2014arrest, adjudication, and confinement\u2014according to GAO's analysis of available data. At the federal level, arrests by federal agencies dropped from 60 Native American youth in 2010 to 20 in 2016, and at the state and local level, arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 arrested in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. GAO also found a number of similarities between Native American and non-Native American youth in state and local justice systems. For example, the offenses that Native American youth and non-Native American youth were arrested, adjudicated, and confined for were generally similar. In contrast, the majority of involvement of non-Native American youth in the federal system during the same period was due to public order or drug and alcohol offenses at all three stages, with the top two specific offenses being drug and immigration related. GAO also found that the percent of Native American youth involved in most state and local systems was generally similar to their representation in the youth populations in those states. For example, the majority (about 75 percent) of Native American youth arrested by state and local law enforcement agencies from calendar years 2010 through 2016 were located in 10 states: Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin. In contrast, GAO found that representation of Native American youth arrested, referred for adjudication, and confined at the federal level during the period reviewed was greater (13 to 19 percent) than their representation in the nationwide youth population (1.6 percent). DOJ and HHS offered at least 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) offered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards through the 122 programs over the period, of which the agencies awarded about $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. GAO found that tribal governments and Native American organizations were eligible for almost all of the grant programs GAO identified. Specifically, they were eligible to apply for 70 of 73 DOJ programs and 48 of 49 HHS programs. However, although tribal governments and Native American organizations were eligible to apply for almost all of the programs, GAO found in a non-generalizable sample of applications that they applied primarily for the programs that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. For example, GAO reviewed applications for 18 DOJ grant programs and found that tribal governments and Native American organizations accounted for over 99 percent of the applications for the 5 grant programs within the sample that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. However, tribal governments and Native American organizations accounted for about 1 percent of the applications for the 13 programs in the sample that did not specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. GAO interviewed officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and seven HHS operating divisions to obtain their perspectives on why tribal governments and Native American organizations might not apply for grant programs that do not specify them as a primary beneficiary. They identified various reasons, including that tribal governments and Native American organizations might not be aware that they are eligible to apply for certain grant programs; might believe that their applications to grant programs that do not specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary will not be competitive with other applications; or might prefer to apply for those grant programs",
    "gao_GAO-19-161": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is responsible for ensuring the safety of commercial trucks, including commercial long-haul trucks. DOT is responsible for regulating commercial trucks, including automated commercial trucks. DOT has also begun preparing for the potential workforce effects of automated trucking. GAO was asked to examine (1) what is known about how and when automated vehicle technologies could affect commercial trucks; (2) what is known about how the adoption of automated trucks could affect the commercial trucking workforce; and (3) the extent to which the Departments of Education, Labor, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs are preparing to assist drivers whose jobs may be affected by automated trucking. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and literature; interviewed federal officials, technology developers, and other stakeholders; and analyzed federal data on the current trucking workforce. What GAO Found Automated commercial trucks are being developed, generally for long-haul trucking. Specifically, GAO found there could be various types of automation for long-haul trucks, including platooning, self-driving for part of a route, and self-driving for an entire route. Stakeholders GAO spoke with and literature GAO reviewed identified several technology-related limitations that may affect the timing of automated truck deployment. For example, several stakeholders said that there may be challenges with self-driving trucks with no person inside when responding to a tire blowout or other mechanical problems. Several legal factors may affect the timing of development, testing, and deployment for automated trucks. For example, a truck's reliance on wireless communication and self-driving software may leave automated trucks vulnerable to cyberattacks. Stakeholders and relevant literature identified several other factors, such as public perception and cybersecurity, that could affect timing for the development and deployment of automated trucks. Predicting workforce changes in light of future automated trucking is inherently challenging, as it is based on uncertainties about how the trucking industry will respond to new technologies that face operational, regulatory, and other factors that could affect deployment. Many of the stakeholders GAO spoke with declined to predict various possible workforce effects, because they said to do so was too speculative. However, stakeholders GAO spoke with and literature GAO reviewed presented two main scenarios for the future trucking workforce: one in which trucks would be self-driving for part of a route, without a driver or operator, and the other in which trucks would require a driver or operator in the truck for the entire route. An operator would monitor truck operations and may not always function as a traditional driver. Because most stakeholders agreed that the prospect of using fully self-driving trucks for an entire route is either unlikely or at least several decades into the future\u2014and no developer GAO spoke with was planning to develop a fully self-driving truck\u2014GAO does not discuss the workforce effects of that scenario in this report. DOT and DOL have taken some steps to prepare for the potential workforce effects of automated trucking. DOT has held public listening sessions to solicit stakeholder perspectives on automated vehicles policy, including how it affects commercial long-haul trucks. DOL has taken steps to study how automated trucking may affect the near-term demand for truck drivers as part of its standard, biennial employment projections for all occupations. DOL officials said they consulted experts and economic studies prior to publishing their most recent projections, covering 2016 to 2026, and included information on possible effects of automation in projections for heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers. DOL officials said they expect automation to assist drivers rather than displace them in the near term. Unlike estimates developed by other researchers, these numbers do not include potential job losses after 2026, though DOL officials noted that the agency's next projections, for 2018 to 2028, will incorporate information on how automated trucking technology has evolved since the 2016-2026 projections. DOT officials said they expect to meet this deadline and report on the analysis by that date. DOL and DOT have taken some steps to convene stakeholders to inform DOT's analysis of automated trucking in advance of March 2019, but have not made plans to continue collaborating to convene key groups of stakeholders as the technology evolves. In so doing, DOL and DOT may be unable to fully anticipate the emerging workforce challenges that may result. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOL and DOT continue to convene stakeholders to gather information on potential workforce effects of automated trucking as the technology evolves, including analyzing needed skills and identifying any information or data gaps. DOL and DOT agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-591": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a role in preventing and addressing juvenile delinquency and victimization. GAO was asked to review the federal justice system for youth. This report examines (1) the number of Native American youth involved with the federal justice system and how this participation has changed over time, (2) the extent to which DOJ and HHS have provided grant programs that could be used to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth, and (3) the extent to which tribal governments and Native American organizations applied for grant programs that could help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. GAO analyzed available data on the number of Native American youth involved with the federal justice system from 2010 through 2016; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; and interviewed officials from DOJ, HHS, and five Native American organizations. What GAO Found From 2010 through 2016, the number of Native American youth involved with state and local and federal justice systems declined, according to GAO's analysis of available data. This decline occurred across all phases of the justice process: arrest, adjudication, and confinement in facilities. The involvement of these Native American youth in the state and local and federal justice systems was also concentrated in certain geographic areas. Further, the vast majority of these Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems, not the federal system. Analysis of available data also indicates that the percent of Native American youth involved in the federal justice system during the period reviewed was greater than their representation in the nationwide youth population. In contrast, the percent of Native American youth involved in most state and local justice systems was similar to their representation in youth populations in those states. Moreover, the involvement of Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system showed several differences (in types of offenses, for example), while their involvement in state and local justice systems showed several similarities. DOJ officials and representatives of Native American organizations GAO interviewed attributed the greater percent of Native American youth involved in the federal justice system and the differences shown by GAO's analysis to federal government jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country, as well as the absence of general federal government jurisdiction over non-Native American youth. GAO identified 122 discretionary grant programs across several issue areas such as violence or trauma, justice system reform, and alcohol and substance abuse that DOJ and HHS offered from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that grantees could use to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS awarded approximately $1.2 billion in first year awards during this period, about $207.7 million of which they collectively awarded to tribal governments and Native American organizations. Tribal governments and Native American organizations were eligible for almost all of these grant programs, but GAO found in a sample GAO reviewed that they primarily applied for those that specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary. Additionally, officials from selected tribal governments, Native American organizations, DOJ, and HHS stated that certain factors affect tribal governments and Native American organizations' ability to apply successfully for grant programs that awardees could use to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOJ and HHS (1) consider establishing a mechanism to provide grants to tribes and Native American organizations that could be used to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth, and (2) establish a mechanism to provide grants to tribes and Native American organizations that could be used to help prevent or address delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-544": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS uses pre-refund compliance checks to confirm taxpayers' identities, quickly and efficiently correct some clerical and mathematical errors, and detect possible fraud and noncompliance. IRS's Return Review Program (RRP) is one of the agency's major information technology investments. GAO was asked to review IRS's RRP. This report examines (1) how RRP detects, selects, and prevents invalid refunds and (2) the extent to which IRS has evaluated the costs and benefits of expanding RRP to analyze returns not claiming refunds. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials. GAO also reviewed IRS's RRP data and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Return Review Program (RRP) is one of the agency's major information technology investments. RRP uses advanced analytic techniques and evaluates data from various sources to assign multiple scores to individual returns claiming refunds. The scores are based on characteristics of identity theft (IDT) and other refund fraud known to IRS. Higher fraud scores indicate the return's greater potential for refund fraud. IRS officials told GAO that RRP's design helps IRS identify increasingly sophisticated tax fraud. RRP uses advanced analytic techniques and evaluates data from various sources to assign multiple scores to individual returns claiming refunds. The scores are based on characteristics of IDT and other refund fraud known to IRS. Higher fraud scores indicate the return's greater potential for refund fraud. IRS officials told GAO that RRP's design helps IRS identify increasingly sophisticated tax fraud. RRP monitors RRP's performance and adapts RRP to improve detection and address evolving fraud threats. IRS plans to continue developing RRP to expand its capabilities to detect refund fraud on business and partnership returns, as well as on individual returns that improperly claim nonrefundable tax credits. According to IRS, continued development of RRP will automate previously manual processes, eliminate duplicative efforts, and achieve greater efficiency. IRS has not fully evaluated the costs and benefits of expanding RRP to analyze returns not claiming refunds. For example, IRS does not use RRP to support other enforcement activities that detect misreporting or noncompliance on individual tax returns not claiming refunds, which also contribute to the tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed and what are paid on time. Underreporting of income represents the majority of the tax gap, with the average annual underreporting of individual income tax on both refund and non-refund returns for tax years 2008 to 2010 estimated by IRS to be about $264 billion or 57 percent of the total gross tax gap of $458 billion. Given the large amount of revenue lost each year due to underreporting, it is important that IRS consider opportunities to improve its enforcement efforts and promote compliance. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS (1) increase the frequency at which incoming W-2 information is made available to RRP; (2) update and expand a 2012 analysis of the costs and benefits of digitizing returns filed on paper; (3) evaluate the costs and benefits of expanding RRP to analyze individual returns not claiming refunds to support other enforcement activities; and (4) expand RRP to support identified activities. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-17-801T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars annually to support its programs and activities. GAO has issued a number of reports and testimonies that address a wide range of issues related to the federal government's programs and activities. GAO has made recommendations to EPA to improve its management and operations, water issues, and public health and environmental justice. This testimony addresses the status of GAO's recommendations and the extent to which EPA has implemented them. This statement is based on GAO's reports and testimonies issued from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. GAO also reviewed EPA's management and operations and related work. GAO also interviewed EPA officials. What GAO Found As of August 23, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had implemented 191 of the 318 recommendations GAO made since fiscal year 2007. The recommendations fall into six broad categories that relate to EPA operations and programs. EPA had not yet fully implemented the remaining 127 recommendations. For recommendations that GAO made over 4 years ago (i.e., fiscal years 2007 to 2012), EPA had implemented 77 percent. For recommendations made since fiscal year 2013, EPA had implemented 34 percent. The 318 recommendations GAO made to EPA fall into six broad categories that relate to EPA operations and programs and generally align with many of the goals and strategies identified in EPA's Fiscal Year 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. These six broad categories are: (1) management and operations; (2) water issues, which includes water infrastructure, drinking water, water quality, and ecosystem restoration; (3) environmental contamination and cleanup, which includes environmental cleanup, pollution prevention, hazardous and other waste programs, and emergency management; (4) toxics, chemical safety, and pesticides; (5) public health and environmental justice; and (6) air quality, climate change, and energy efficiency. The percentage of recommendations implemented within each category ranged from 80 percent for the environmental contamination and cleanup category to 48 percent in the management and operations category. Almost three-fourths of the recommendations GAO made since fiscal year 2007 fall into three categories: management and operations, water issues, and environmental contamination and cleanup. The recommendations to EPA relating to management and operations included actions for better managing its grants, better coordinating management of its laboratories, and improving the agency's information security. Recommendations on water issues included actions targeted at improving the regulation of contaminants in drinking water, improving water quality and ecosystem health in regions such as the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay, and better managing water pollution from both point and nonpoint sources. Recommendations related to environmental contamination and cleanup included taking actions for better managing cleanup at hazardous waste sites; enhancing responses to disasters, such as the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina in August 2005; and promoting proper disposal and recycling of electronic waste. The remaining quarter of the recommendations fell into the other three categories of toxics, chemical safety, and pesticides; air quality, climate change, and energy efficiency; and public health and environmental justice. GAO has identified many benefits\u2014process and programmatic improvements and financial benefits\u2014based on EPA taking actions on GAO's recommendations and related work. Since fiscal year 2007, GAO has identified improvements to EPA's operations and programs in categories such as management and operations, water issues, and public health and environmental justice. In addition, GAO has identified financial benefits resulting from the implementation of GAO's recommendations and related work. For example, in fiscal year 2016, GAO recorded a total of 1,234 other benefits from its work that cannot be measured in dollars, but that led to program and operational improvements to the federal government. These benefits are linked to specific recommendations or other work that GAO completed over several years and could include improvements to agency programs, processes, and policies.",
    "gao_GAO-19-132": "Why GAO Did This Study The Army has made substantial changes to how it intends to coordinate and oversee modernization efforts, due at least in part to the lost years and billions of dollars from past efforts to modernize. The Army has taken positive steps to improve its current modernization efforts and has already seen some initial successes. The creation of the new command, the integration of the cross-functional teams to better refine requirements and cultivate technologies, the realignment of several existing organizations, and the shifting of personnel gives the Army a unique opportunity to take advantage of leading practices and its own lessons learned. GAO was asked to review the Army's modernization strategy. This report assesses (1) the status of the Army's efforts to establish new acquisition organizations while balancing near- and long-term modernization; and (2) the extent to which the Army has applied leading practices to do so. GAO reviewed Army directives and directives, Army directives, and Army directives; interviewed Army officials; and analyzed Army documentation and documents related to the cross-functional team pilots. What GAO Found The Army has established eight cross-functional team pilots to pilot its modernization efforts. The cross-functional team pilots were intended to: take steps toward achieving the six modernization priorities; leverage expertise from industry and academia; identify ways to use experimentation, prototyping, and demonstrations; and identify opportunities to improve the efficiency of requirements development and the overall defense systems acquisition process. These cross-functional team pilots are transitioning from independent organizations to organizations within the Army Futures Command, which will also subsume other existing Army organizations tasked with modernization. Army Futures Command is in the process of establishing its policies, processes, and functions as well as its relationships with other Army organizations. It plans to reach full capability by July 2019. The Army has already identified near-term priorities and realigned over $1 billion in science and technology funding for long-term modernization. Army Futures Command will be responsible for continuing this prioritization. The Army has generally applied leading practices for technology development and establishing effective cross-functional teams, and has begun to apply leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations for the Army Futures Command. During the Army's pilot phase for its eight cross-functional team pilots, the teams took actions consistent with leading practices for technology development, such as bringing together requirements developers and warfighters, planning prototype demonstrations, and maturing technology prior to beginning an acquisition program. The Army's pilot teams also applied eight leading practices GAO has identified for establishing effective cross-functional teams to varying degrees. In addition, senior Army leadership has been clear in its support for the new command and has clearly outlined a timeframe for its establishment, actions that are in line with the leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations GAO has identified in prior work. Whether further application of these leading practices will continue under the new command is unclear as the role of the cross-functional teams has not yet been formalized and Army Futures Command has not yet taken all the steps needed to reach full operational capability. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Army ensure that the Commanding General of Army Futures Command applies leading practices as they relate to technology development, particularly that of demonstrating technology in an operational environment prior to starting system development. The Department of Defense concurred with all four recommendations and made certain technical comments which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-229": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have a large presence in the nation's criminal justice system. In recent years, federal law enforcement officers and agents have been involved in a wide variety of incidents involving individuals with mental illness. GAO was asked to review federal law enforcement responses to incidents involving individuals with mental illness. This report addresses the following key questions: (1) What challenges, if any, do federal law enforcement officers at selected DHS and DOJ components face when responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness? (2) What type of training, policies, and guidance, if any, are in place at selected DHS and DOJ components to prepare federal law enforcement officers for responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness? (3) What leading practices or tools have relevant stakeholders cited for effective responses to incidents involving individuals with mental illness, and how have DHS and DOJ components leveraged information from other knowledgeable parties? GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from DHS and DOJ components. GAO also held discussion groups with six to eleven agents or officers at each component in its scope. What GAO Found According to the DHS and DOJ law enforcement officers and agents GAO interviewed, they are not positioned to diagnose any specific mental health condition that an individual might have, as they are not trained mental health professionals. However, responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness can be challenging for multiple reasons, including determining whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or from another issue, such as drug addiction, and communicating with the person, for example, when a person may be suffering from delusions. These officers and agents face these challenges while also being responsible for ensuring their own safety and that of others in the area. The law enforcement components within GAO's scope at DHS and DOJ have policies or guidance in place that addresses responding to incidents involving individuals with mental illness. Some components' policies or guidance specifically addresses mental illness, while others touch on the issue as part of larger policies on other topics (such as use of force). DHS has guidance in place to help ensure that its components have policies and training that align with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and obligations under section 504. In 2013, and 2015, respectively, DHS issued a directive and implementing instruction to its components intended to strengthen compliance with section 504. These documents required DHS components to conduct a self-evaluation and prepare a component plan identifying any policies or practices that may result in a qualified individual with a disability being excluded from participation in, or being denied the benefits of, a program or activity. In addition, in January 2017, DOJ's then-Deputy Attorney General issued a memo with attached guidance directing components to review their policies and training and, where necessary, modify or develop policies and training to implement legal requirements and principles related to section 504. This guidance identified, among other things, DOJ's law enforcement components' legal obligations under section 504.

    "gao_GAO-19-232": "Why GAO Did This Study CDBG-DR funds are used to help states and localities recover from disasters. The 2017 hurricanes triggered a large increase in the amount of CDBG-DR funds available to help states recover from disasters. GAO was asked to review CDBG-DR. This report examines (1) the status of CDBG-DR funds and (2) the challenges that CDBG-DR grantees have faced in implementing CDBG-DR. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed HUD and CDBG-DR grantees; and analyzed HUD data on CDBG-DR funds. What GAO Found As of January 2019, all four CDBG-DR grantees had entered into grant agreements with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for their initial 2017 CDBG-DR funds, but they needed to take additional steps before disbursing funds to individuals affected by the 2017 hurricanes. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocated the majority of the 2017 CDBG-DR funds to four agencies: Puerto Rico's Department of Housing (Departamento de la Vivienda), the Texas General Land Office, the U.S. Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority, and Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity. The four grantees had signed grant agreements with HUD by the end of September 2018. The Federal Register notice allocating the initial $7.4 billion in CDBG-DR funds required grantees to take a number of steps before they could enter into a grant agreement with HUD and begin expending funds. These steps had associated deadlines, which the four grantees generally met. The grant agreements require grantees to expend their entire CDBG-DR allocations on eligible activities within 6 years of signing their grant agreements. HUD officials said that this requirement has been included in grant agreements since 2015 to help speed up the expenditure of funds. As of January 2019, the grantees had generally not drawn down funds for individuals affected by the 2017 hurricanes because they were designing and setting up the activities to assist these individuals. HUD's review of the financial controls, procurement processes, and grant management procedures that grantees develop was limited. For example, HUD's financial certification checklist asks HUD staff to determine whether a grantee has attached its procedures for preventing duplication of benefits and verifying all sources of disaster assistance received. However, the certification checklist does not ask HUD staff to assess the adequacy of the grantee's approach for verifying all sources of disaster assistance. HUD officials said that they have other documentation that supplements the checklists, but GAO found that documentation lacked sufficient information for assessing the submissions. HUD's reviewers did not document their conclusions that grantees' financial controls, procurement processes, and grant management procedures were sufficient. Without additional guidance for HUD staff to use in assessing the quality of grantees' submissions, stakeholders and decision makers lack information on why HUD concluded that grantees' financial processes and procedures and capacity and unmet needs assessments were adequate. HUD did not have a comprehensive plan to monitor the large 2017 CDBG-DR grants and other outstanding grants. HUD officials said that they planned to hire additional staff for the Disaster Recovery and Special Issues Division but that they had not finalized their hiring plans. Without strategic workforce planning that determines if the number of staff HUD plans to hire is sufficient to oversee the growing number of CDBG-DR grants, identifies the critical skills and competencies needed, and includes strategies to address any gaps, HUD will not be able to identify the staffing resources necessary to oversee CDBG-DR grants. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HUD develop additional guidance for staff to use when assessing the adequacy of grantees' financial controls, procurement processes, and grant management procedures and that HUD develop and implement a comprehensive monitoring plan for the 2017 grants. HUD partially agreed with two of GAO's recommendations and generally agreed with the remaining three.",
    "gao_GAO-18-619": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Energy (DOE) provides funding for advanced fossil energy research and development (R&D) to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants from coal-fired power plants, among other things. DOE also provides loan guarantees for advanced fossil energy projects under the Loan Guarantee Program (LGP). EPAct authorizes DOE to provide loan guarantees for projects that avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or man-made emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued. EPAct also includes a provision for GAO to review DOE's loan guarantees. This report describes 1) DOE's funding of advanced fossil energy R&D projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and the types of projects and recipients that received funding, and 2) DOE's loan guarantees, if any, for advanced fossil energy projects from fiscal year 2006 through August 2018. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOE guidance; analyzed DOE advanced fossil energy R&D project data for fiscal years 2010 through 2017; and interviewed DOE officials. What GAO Found DOE provided $2.66 billion in funding for 794 advanced fossil energy R&D projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. These 794 projects included 9 later-stage large demonstration projects and 785 other advanced fossil energy R&D projects. DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding to 9 large demonstration projects aimed at demonstrating the commercial viability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. DOE provided $1.54 billion in funding to 785 other R&D projects for both coal and oil and gas technologies, mostly to universities and industry, located in 46 states and the District of Columbia. For 9 large demonstration projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, DOE provided $1.12 billion in funding. These projects received that funding from appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and supported efforts to reduce the financial and technical risks of commercial CCS, according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service. Six demonstration projects researched CCS technologies using coal, while three used other fuels, namely methane, ethanol, and petcoke. Recipients were generally required to provide a certain percentage of the cost of each R&D project, called cost share. Specifically, to receive funding, recipients of funding for the 9 large demonstration projects agreed to pay at least $610 million in cost share for the demonstration projects. Three of those demonstration projects remained active at the end of fiscal year 2017. Four projects had their support withdrawn by DOE, and two were withdrawn by the recipient. These projects ended due to several factors such as a lack of technical progress, the closure of the Recovery Act appropriations account on September 30, 2015, and changing economic conditions\u2014such as decreased natural gas prices which resulted in changes in the relative prices of coal and natural gas. DOE provided $1.54 billion in funding for 785 other advanced fossil energy R&D projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. For these 785 R&D projects, DOE provided: on average, $2.0 million per project; a median of $0.8 million per project; less than $5 million to 91.8 percent (721) of the 785 projects; and less than $1 million to 58.1 percent (456) of the projects. For projects started from fiscal years 2010 through 2017, total funding for projects by fiscal year started ranged from less than $100 million to more than $300 million. The recipients of the funding for the 785 advanced fossil energy R&D projects were mostly universities and industry groups that were located in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Of these recipients, approximately 51 percent were universities; 43 percent were industry groups; and 5 percent were other entities, including other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey. DOE made no loans for advanced fossil energy from fiscal year 2006 through August 2018. Specifically, the 2006 and 2008 advanced fossil energy solicitations were for projects that involved coal-based power generation and that would incorporate CCS, coal gasification, or other beneficial uses of carbon, among other things. However, neither solicitation resulted in any loan guarantees, in part because during this timeframe of the late 2000s, natural gas prices fell, causing a shift in the market, which led to such coal-related projects no longer being economically competitive. According to DOE officials, five fossil energy applicants were actively moving through the process of review as of August 2018. For example, in January 2018, one applicant issued a press release stating that it was pursuing a $1.9 billion loan guarantee to support the development of infrastructure for a proposed underground storage facility for natural gas liquids and intermediates. Nine fossil energy applicants had been idle or not following up with the Loan Programs Office. Three applicants did not meet certain eligibility requirements. Two companies with",
    "gao_GAO-18-199": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a high concentration of arsenic in drinking water, which may be a significant source of arsenic in the United States. In 2013, NRC reported that long-term ingestion of arsenic from water or dietary sources, such as rice, may be associated with adverse health effects, such as skin lesions and cancer. GAO was asked to review the risk to human health from arsenic in rice. This report examines (1) what NRC and recent key scientific reviews have reported about the effects of ingestion of arsenic on human health, (2) the extent to which FDA and USDA have managed the risk to human health from arsenic in rice, and (3) the extent to which FDA has coordinated with USDA and other federal agencies on actions to manage the risk. GAO analyzed NRC and key scientific reviews; interviewed FDA and USDA officials; and conducted site visits to Arkansas' rice agricultural research and production areas and rice mills. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have taken actions to manage the risk to human health from arsenic in rice, including assessing the type and prevalence of health effects that may result from long-term ingestion. These efforts were generally consistent with the six essential elements for managing risk, which GAO has found could help agencies assess threats that could affect the achievement of their goals. FDA has taken actions that were consistent with five of the six essential elements, including: (1) aligning risk management process with goals and objectives, (2) identifying risks, (3) assessing risks, (4) responding to the risks, and (5) monitoring risks. However, FDA has not fully taken action on the sixth element of communicating and reporting on risks. FDA issued a risk assessment in 2016 for public comment and a draft guidance limiting the levels of arsenic in infant rice cereal, but it has not updated or finalized these key documents. USDA has taken actions consistent with five of the six essential elements but has not taken actions to monitor the risk because of its more limited, nonregulatory role. FDA coordinated with USDA and other federal agencies on the actions to manage the risk of arsenic in rice for which coordination would be expected, to varying extents. FDA coordinated with USDA and several other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Institutes of Health, on the development of the risk assessment and draft guidance on arsenic in infant rice cereal, but USDA raised concerns about the extent of the coordination. FDA and USDA coordinated to a limited extent to develop faster and less expensive methods to detect contaminants in food, including arsenic in rice. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FDA develop a timeline for updating the risk assessment on arsenic in rice, and that USDA work with FDA to develop a mechanism to coordinate the development of methods to detect contaminants in food, including arsenic in rice. HHS generally agreed with GAO's findings and three of the four recommendations directed to it and partially agreed with the other recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-31": "Why GAO Did This Study The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 resulted in the tragic loss of 11 lives and a devastating environmental impact. In April 2016, BP, the federal government, and the five Gulf Coast states reached a settlement resolving multiple claims for federal civil penalties and natural resource damages related to the spill totaling up to $14.9 billion. The settlement includes $1 billion BP previously committed to pay for early restoration projects, and up to $700 million to address injuries that were unknown to the trustees as of July 2, 2015. The settlement also established a new trust fund for programs, projects, and activities that restore and protect the environment and economy of the Gulf Coast region. GAO was asked to review the status of restoration efforts related to the oil spills. This report examines (1) how the trustee councils have used the restoration trust funds for the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills and the status of the restoration efforts; (2) the status of the interagency committee's oil spill research efforts and how coordination of such efforts has changed since GAO last reported on it in March 2011; and (3) what literature suggests about the effectiveness of various oil spill response techniques in the Arctic and the Gulf of Mexico. GAO reviewed the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills and the trustee councils' use of the restoration funds; reviewed relevant literature; and interviewed officials from the trustee councils, the interagency committee, and the Department of the Interior. What GAO Found The Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the trustee councils have used the restoration trust funds to authorize money for activities in accordance with approved restoration plans. The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council has largely completed restoration work and authorized approximately $985 million, roughly 86 percent of the restoration trust fund, primarily on habitat protection and general restoration, research, and monitoring activities. As a result of these restoration activities and natural recovery, the majority of the injured natural resources and human services in the spill area has recovered or is recovering, according to the council's assessment. However, the Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council continues to monitor the lack of recovery of Pacific herring and the presence of lingering oil in the spill area. The Deepwater Horizon Trustee Council is completing early restoration work and initial post-settlement restoration planning. It has authorized approximately $1.1 billion for restoration activities, roughly 13 percent of the restoration trust fund, and spent $368 million, roughly 5 percent of the restoration trust fund, primarily on habitat protection and enhancing recreation, such as building boat ramps and other recreational facilities. Nine of the interagency committee member agencies funded over 100 oil spill research projects per year from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, for a total cost of about $200 million; however, GAO found that the interagency committee did not coordinate its research with some key entities. For example, the interagency committee has not systematically reviewed its membership to determine which offices within current member agencies are the most relevant to its mission and whether adding other federal agencies as members would be beneficial. By systematically reviewing its membership to determine whether any additional agencies should be involved in coordinating oil spill research and that the most appropriate offices within member agencies are represented, the interagency committee could improve its ability to coordinate research among federal agencies. In addition, the interagency committee does not coordinate with the Natural Resource Damage Assessment trustee councils that manage the large restoration funds and monitor the restoration of damaged resources after a specific spill, such as the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills. Coordinating with the NRDA trustee councils could help ensure that the interagency committee's oil spill research program is effectively supporting the damage assessment and restoration efforts of the councils, and better knowledge sharing between groups and leveraging its members' oil spill research resources. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard direct the chair of the interagency committee to systematically review its membership to determine whether any additional agencies should be involved in coordinating oil spill research and that the most appropriate offices within member agencies are represented. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-16": "Why GAO Did This Study The aging population has raised concerns about the sustainability and adequacy of pensions, especially as many workers continue to exit the labor force before the statutory or full retirement age. To address this development, some countries have implemented programs that allow older workers to reduce their working hours to transition into retirement, rather than stopping working abruptly at a given age. GAO was asked to review the U.S. experience with phased retirement. This report examines (1) the extent to which phased retirement exists in other countries with aging populations, (2) the key aspects of phased retirement programs in selected countries, and (3) the experiences that other countries have had in providing phased retirement and how that can inform the U.S. experience. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials and experts in Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (U.K.)\u2014the countries with the highest proportion of the population aged 50 and over\u2014and the experiences of other countries with phased retirement. GAO also reviewed relevant research and interviewed government officials, unions, and employers in selected countries. What GAO Found GAO identified 17 countries with some kind of phased retirement program. Among the 44 countries that met GAO's initial criteria as having a national pension system similar to social security and an aging population, GAO identified 17 with some kind of phased retirement program. Specifically, GAO identified 17 with some kind of phased retirement program. Specifically, GAO identified 17 programs in Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the U.K. based on a review of relevant research, studies, and interviews. The national policies implemented in the selected countries are mainly designed to encourage older workers to remain in the labor force and continue to earn and contribute to their pensions, and often, share their institutional knowledge with younger workers. For example, Canada amended its income tax regulations in 2007 to allow phased retirement under certain defined benefit pension plans. In addition, the four countries reported having made efforts at the national level to encourage phased retirement, including implementing national policies and programs that involve public subsidies, tax incentives, or changing pension rules to allow individuals to receive partial pension benefits while continuing to accrue benefits in the same pension plan. GAO found that the individual programs offered by employers in the selected countries had similarities and differences in how the programs were established, designed, implemented, and funded. For example, most of the programs were established as part of collective bargaining agreements between employers and union-represented workers. However, the specific terms of the programs differed from program to program. For example, a sectoral phased retirement program in Sweden allowed workers to apply for phased retirement at age 60, and draw down 50, 80, or 90 percent of their earned employer-sponsored retirement account while phasing. A public sector employee program in the U.K. provided a phased retirement option at age 55, and workers could draw down from 20 to 80 percent of their employer-sponsored pension while reducing their work hours. In contrast, a public sector employee program in the U.K. provided a phased retirement option at age 55, and workers could draw down from 20 to 80 percent of their employer-sponsored pension while reducing their work hours. In the four countries, the phased retirement programs offered by employers had similarities and differences in how the programs were established, designed, implemented, and funded. Institutional and employer-specific factors in other countries, which shape the design of phased retirement programs, typically differ from the institutional environment experienced by many U.S. private sector employers, although they may be similar to those common in U.S. public sector employment. Some of these institutional factors include the extent to which employers and workers are supported by universal health insurance, whether the programs are structured around employer-sponsored traditional defined benefit (DB) plans\u2014particularly for workers who have worked at their firm long enough to qualify for phased retirement\u2014and whether programs are the result of collective bargaining agreements. In many of the selected countries, phased retirement programs designed to extend labor force participation are fairly recent. While the rate of employment among older workers in the case study countries and the U.S. increased in recent years, data has not been collected in the case study countries to gauge the effects of phased retirement and participation is low. Experiences of the case study countries suggest that, in implementing such programs at the employer or national level, phased retirement programs may be more effective if carefully designed based on the employer's specific industry or production characteristics, and with data collected and analyzed to pinpoint the most successful strategies.

    "gao_GAO-18-37": "Why GAO Did This Study SSA's disability programs provide more than $200 billion in benefits for tens of millions of Americans annually. The hearings and appeals level of the disability decision-making process is particularly important because about one in three people receiving benefits are granted benefits at this level. Given the number of people and the dollars at stake, it is crucial that claimants are treated fairly and their applications are evaluated accurately and consistently across the country, at all levels of the program. GAO was asked to review the variation in allowance rates across judges and associated factors. This report examines (1) the extent to which allowance rates vary across administrative law judges, and any factors that are associated with this variation, and (2) the extent to which SSA has processes to monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions. GAO analyzed SSA data on allowance rates from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, reviewed relevant federal laws and performance management literature, and interviewed SSA officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found Allowance rates varied across administrative law judges from fiscal years 2007 through 2015. GAO's analysis of 3.3 million decisions made by administrative law judges on adult Social Security disability appeals from fiscal years 2007 through 2015 found that the average allowance rate across judges fell 15 percentage points over this period\u2014from a peak of 70 percent in 2008 to 55 percent in 2015. However, the range in allowance rates across judges remained fairly constant, even when GAO used multivariate statistical methods to hold constant a variety of factors related to the disability appeals process. These factors included characteristics of claimants, judges, and hearing offices, as well as other factors such as the unemployment rates in a claimant's state. GAO's multivariate analysis enabled GAO to compare allowance rates across judges and hearing offices for typical claims. In addition, GAO found that many of the factors GAO identified had meaningful associations with the chance that a claimant was allowed benefits. These factors include the claimant's age, impairment, prior work, and education. GAO also identified factors that did not have such associations. For example, certain claimant characteristics\u2014such as older ages or certain impairments\u2014were associated with higher allowance rates. SSA has employed a range of efforts to monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions, but it lacks performance measures to report publicly on these efforts. SSA's current strategic plan includes an objective to \"improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness\" of its disability decisions; however, all of the hearings-level measures supporting this objective are related to timeliness. SSA's current strategic plan includes an objective to \"improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness\" of its disability decisions; however, all of the hearings-level measures supporting this objective are related to timeliness. SSA has employed a range of efforts to monitor the accuracy and consistency of hearings decisions, but it lacks performance measures to report publicly on these efforts. SSA provides training and tools to all administrative law judges and initiates disciplinary actions where needed, as part of its efforts to monitor and improve accuracy and consistency. SSA also conducts multiple quality assurance reviews, but some of these reviews may overlap and SSA has not evaluated them. Federal internal control standards state that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve objectives, including to external stakeholders such as Congress and the public. Given the persistent variation in allowance rates, SSA may be missing an opportunity to provide the public with information on the results of its efforts to improve the accuracy and consistency of disability decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that SSA (1) develop a set of public performance measures for the accuracy and consistency of administrative law judges' decisions, and (2) systematically evaluate its various quality assurance reviews and take steps to reduce or better manage any unnecessary overlap among them. SSA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-183": "Why GAO Did This Study The Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 includes a provision for GAO to assess final significant regulatory actions promulgated by executive departments during specified presidential transition periods and to analyze and compare multiple characteristics of regulations issued during these transition periods to each other and to regulations issued during the same 120-day period (September 23 to January 20) in nontransition years since 1996. The act also includes a provision for GAO to assess final significant regulatory actions promulgated by executive departments during specified presidential transition periods and to analyze and compare multiple characteristics of regulations issued during these transition periods to each other and to regulations issued during the same 120-day period (September 23 to January 20) in nontransition years since 1996. GAO analyzed the number of regulations and other indicators related to the scope and transparency of these regulations; agencies' reported compliance with procedural requirements for promulgating the regulations; and anticipated economic effects agencies reported would result from the regulations. GAO analyzed the universe of all 527 final economically significant regulations published during the specified time periods and a generalizable stratified random sample of 358 final significant regulations from the population of the 1,633 final significant regulations published during those same periods. GAO also reviewed the Congressional Review Act (CRA) noncompliance rates for the agencies publishing the largest number of economically significant regulations. What GAO Found The three administrations published a higher number of economically significant and significant final regulations at the end of each President's second term compared to the nontransition periods. The administrations published on average roughly 2.5 times more economically significant regulations during their transition periods than during nontransition periods. GAO's analysis also showed that within their transition periods (September 23 through January 20), the administrations of Presidents Clinton and Obama increased their rate of economically significant rulemaking following the elections held in 2000 and 2016 (between Election Day in November and January 20), while President Bush's administration decreased the rate of economically significant rulemaking following the 2008 election. GAO found that the majority of economically significant regulations were published by a subset of agencies across the three administrations and between transition and nontransition periods. In particular, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published one-third of the economically significant regulations GAO reviewed across all periods and was the most active agency in both transition and nontransition periods. However, significant rulemaking was less concentrated in a subset of agencies than was economically significant rulemaking. Specifically, five of the agencies that published the largest number of economically significant regulations accounted for between 65 and 70 percent of these regulations during both transition and nontransition periods, while the five agencies that published the largest number of significant regulations accounted for 42 percent of these regulations during both transition and nontransition periods. Nearly all economically significant regulations reported to the public compliance with four procedural requirements, but a quarter did not comply with the Congressional Review Act (CRA) requirements. Specifically, 91 percent of economically significant regulations across all periods reviewed explained to the public the determinations the agencies made regarding these three procedural requirements. Further, there was little difference between transition and nontransition periods in whether agencies provided explanation of these three procedural requirements. For the regulations that did not contain explanation, agencies indicated that more economically significant regulations published during transition periods than in nontransition periods: (1) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (RFA), (2) contained information collection requirements on nonfederal entities (PRA), and (3) generally could impose federal mandates on nonfederal entities (UMRA). For significant regulations, GAO estimates that 64 percent across all periods reviewed provided explanation to the public of the determinations the agencies made regarding these three procedural requirements. For the regulations that did not contain explanation, agencies indicated that more economically significant regulations published during transition periods than in nontransition periods: (1) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (RFA), (2) contained information collection requirements on nonfederal entities (PRA), and (3) generally could impose federal mandates on nonfederal entities (UMRA).

    "gao_GAO-19-220": "Why GAO Did This Study State is the lead agency involved in implementing American foreign policy and representing the United States abroad. State's Foreign Service employees serve in a variety of functions at overseas posts, including generalists and specialists. GAO was asked to review State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. This report examines (1) vacancies in State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts, (2) reported effects of Foreign Service vacancies on diplomatic readiness, and (3) State's efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies. GAO analyzed State's personnel data on Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts from 2008 to 2018, reviewed State's workforce planning documents, and interviewed State officials. What GAO Found According to Department of State (State) data, the number of both staffed and vacant overseas Foreign Service positions increased between 2008 and 2018. Despite the increase in the number of positions staffed, GAO found that 13 percent of State's overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant as of March 31, 2018. This vacancy percentage is similar to the percentages of vacancies in overseas Foreign Service positions that GAO reported in 2012 and 2008. State's data show persistent vacancies in Foreign Service generalist positions responsible for analysis, engagement, and reporting at overseas posts. State officials said that State has had difficulty in recruiting and hiring Foreign Service employees to fill specialist positions in some skill groups at overseas posts. According to State officials, some vacant specialist positions are more difficult to fill than others because candidates for these positions must often possess skills in fields such as medicine or information technology that tend to be highly sought after in the private sector. Vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts present additional challenges because specialized skills and competencies are often required to perform the work of these positions. Vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts have adversely affected State's diplomatic readiness. According to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in Foreign Service generalist positions at overseas posts adversely affect State's diplomatic readiness. Among Foreign Service generalist career tracks, the political and economic career tracks had the two largest percentages of vacant positions--20 percent and 16 percent, respectively. According to staff at overseas posts, vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts may heighten the level of security risk at the posts and disrupt post operations. Among Foreign Service specialist skill groups with the highest number of vacant positions, security officer, office management specialist, and information management had the largest percentages of vacant positions--16 percent, 16 percent, and 14 percent, respectively. State officials described various efforts to address overseas Foreign Service vacancies, but these efforts are not guided by an integrated action plan to reduce persistent vacancies. GAO's 2017 High-Risk Series report calls for agencies to, among other things, design and implement action plan strategies for closing skills gaps. The action plan should (1) define the root cause of all skills gaps within an agency and (2) provide suggested corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions. This report also emphasizes the high risk that mission-critical skills gaps in the federal workforce pose to the nation. While various State offices have implemented the efforts GAO identified, State lacks an action plan that is integrated\u2014or consolidated\u2014across its relevant offices to guide its efforts to address persistent overseas Foreign Service vacancies. Moreover, some staff at overseas posts acknowledged that the efforts State has taken to help address vacancies have not reduced persistent Foreign Service vacancies, notably in specialist positions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions. State concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-447": "Why GAO Did This Study The Army's Patriot system is a mobile surface-to-air missile system designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles; cruise missiles; and other threats such as airplanes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Army's reset process seeks to bring Patriot equipment returning from the Central Command area of responsibility back to Army standards. Recapitalization seeks to add life to the system, and it provides an opportunity for the Army to make incremental modernization upgrades, such as the insertion of new software, technology insertions, or replacing obsolete parts. GAO was asked to review the Army's recapitalization process. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Army's reset process supports the timely delivery of Patriot equipment back to units, and (2) the Army's plans for supporting the long-term viability of the Patriot system through recapitalization and any challenges associated with its plans. GAO analyzed Army documents and interviewed Army officials and stakeholders. GAO also interviewed Army officials and stakeholders from the Army's headquarters and headquarters batteries, as well as two Patriot battalions that recently underwent reset and their brigade headquarters. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2014 through 2017, the Army often did not return reset equipment to units in accordance with the timelines established in Army regulation, which affected unit training. Although the Army has identified several factors that contributed to delays in returning equipment to units and monitors these factors, it has not assessed their relative importance. For example, the unit leadership of some deployed Patriot battalions do not emphasize preventive maintenance, which can create additional work tasks for depot personnel when they receive it, such as conducting additional or more detailed inspections. As a result, equipment may not be properly maintained to Army standards and can create additional work tasks for depot personnel when they receive it, such as conducting additional or more detailed inspections. Also, the Army has not analyzed how much each of the factors affecting timeliness contributes to delays. Unless the Army conducts a comprehensive analysis of the relative importance of the factors affecting Patriot reset timeliness and develops and implements appropriate corrective actions to address the results of the analysis, it will not be positioned to target its efforts most effectively to take corrective actions. The Army has decided to recapitalize each battalion set of Patriot equipment once every 15 years, while recognizing that this approach introduces some challenges to upgrading and supporting the system's readiness to meet its assigned missions through 2048. While the Army would prefer to recapitalize Patriot equipment every 10 years, the Army has reviewed two options for recapitalizing Patriot equipment more frequently and determined that these options are not feasible. For example, the Army could reduce the amount of equipment available for ongoing commitments and recapitalize it at the depot. However, Army officials stated that if the Army decided to adjust the pace to recapitalize more than the current one battalion per year, it would require buying more equipment to ensure that any additional units undergoing recapitalization would not be left without equipment. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Army ensure that the Army conducts a comprehensive analysis of the primary factors affecting timeliness to identify their relative importance in the Army's Patriot reset program and develops and implements appropriate corrective actions. The Department of the Army concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-147T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard and NOAA are investing taxpayer dollars to modernize their fleets. In March 2018, GAO reported that the Coast Guard did not have a long-term fleet modernization plan that identified all acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next two decades within available resources. GAO recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the identified assets. DHS agreed with GAO's recommendation but has not yet approved a 20-year plan. GAO was asked to testify on the Coast Guard's acquisition efforts. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which strategic planning in acquisitions enables better tradeoff decisions, (2) the extent to which successful acquisition programs begin with sound business cases, and (3) the extent to which agencies have assessed the potential savings and requirements stability of contracting mechanisms. This statement is based on GAO's September 2018 report, which examined the Coast Guard's acquisition efforts and the Navy's acquisition efforts. What GAO Found Strategic planning in acquisitions enables better tradeoff decisions. Key elements of strategic planning include establishing long-term goals and strategies for how those goals are to be achieved. Specifically for managing Coast Guard acquisitions, GAO has noted that a long-term plan that includes acquisition implications would enable tradeoffs to be addressed in advance, which leads to better informed choices and makes debate possible before irreversible commitments are made to individual programs. Without this type of plan, decision makers do not have the information they need to better understand and address an agency's long-term outlook. Similarly, according to the Office of Management and Budget's capital planning guidance referenced by the Coast Guard's Major Systems Acquisition Manual, each agency is encouraged to have a plan that justifies its long-term capital asset decisions. This plan should include, among other things, (1) an analysis of the portfolio of assets already owned by the agency and in procurement, (2) the performance gap and capability necessary to bridge the old and new assets, and (3) justification for new acquisitions proposed for funding. GAO recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the identified assets. DHS agreed with GAO's recommendation but has not yet approved a 20-year plan. Further, in July 2018, GAO found the Coast Guard continues to manage its acquisitions through its annual budget process and the 5-year Capital Investment Plan, which is congressionally mandated and submitted to Congress annually. However, the effects of these trade-off decisions, such as which acquisitions would take on more risk so others can be prioritized and adequately funded, are not communicated in the Capital Investment Plan to key decision makers. Over the years, this approach has left the Coast Guard with a bow wave of near-term unfunded acquisitions, negatively affecting recapitalization efforts, and limiting the effectiveness of long-term planning. As a result of this planning process, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability gaps unaddressed that could affect future operations. GAO recommended that the annual Capital Investment Plans reflect acquisition trade-off decisions and their effects. DHS concurred with this recommendation and plans to include additional information in future Capital Investment Plans to address how trade-off decisions could affect other major acquisition programs. GAO's prior work has repeatedly found that successful acquisition programs start with solid, executable business cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. A sound business case requires balance between the concept selected to satisfy operator requirements and the resources\u2014design knowledge, technologies, funding, and time\u2014needed to transform the concept into a product, such as a ship. At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach\u2014a knowledge-based approach\u2014that requires balance between the concept selected to satisfy operator requirements and the resources\u2014design knowledge, technologies, funding, and time\u2014needed to transform the concept into a product, such as a ship. GAO has previously found that key enablers of a good business case include firm, feasible requirements; plans for a stable design; mature technologies; reliable cost estimates; and realistic schedule targets. Without a sound business case, acquisition programs are at risk of experiencing cost growth, schedule delays, and reduced capabilities. Given the Navy's experience in shipbuilding, agencies have partnered with the Navy to take advantage of its expertise. For example, in April and September 2018, GAO found examples of how the Coast Guard had leveraged the Navy's resources and acquisition approaches when acquiring the polar icebreakers, including: Establishing an integrated program office and potentially using",
    "gao_GAO-19-131": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars annually on IT. These investments often suffer from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. As a result of these failures, GAO added Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations to its biennial high-risk list in 2015. The act included specific provisions related to seven areas, including the five areas selected for GAO's review: (1) CIO authority enhancements, (2) enhanced transparency and improved risk management in IT investments, (3) portfolio review, (4) federal data center consolidation initiative, and (5) software purchasing. GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 24 agencies' implementation of FITARA provisions and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed documents from the nine agencies and OMB. What GAO Found The nine selected agencies identified a total of 12 practices that helped them to successfully implement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) provisions considered in this review. Among the practices, a number of the agencies identified four that were overarching\u2014that is, the practices were not unique to a specific provision, but, instead, better positioned agencies to implement the five provisions selected for GAO's review. In addition, agencies identified one practice that helped ensure effective implementation of CIO one practice that helped ensure enhanced transparency and improved one practice that ensured effective portfolio review, four practices that facilitated data center consolidation, and one practice that facilitated software purchasing.

    "gao_GAO-18-123": "Why GAO Did This Study The RAD program provides public housing agencies (PHA) the opportunity to convert units subsidized under HUD's public housing program to properties with long-term (typically, 15\u201320 years) project-based vouchers or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts. The RAD program is intended to preserve the affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improve their physical and financial condition. GAO was asked to review the RAD program. This report examines (1) HUD's assessment of the physical and financial outcomes of RAD conversion to date; (2) how RAD conversions affected residents and what safeguards were in place to protect them, including while temporarily relocated and during conversion; (3) what challenges, if any, public housing agencies (PHA) faced in implementing RAD; and (4) the extent to which RAD provisions are designed to help preserve the long-term affordability of units. GAO analyzed HUD data on RAD conversions since RAD's authorization (from fiscal years 2013 through 2017), reviewed documentation on RAD conversions, and interviewed HUD officials and developers. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program has been implemented and expanded in phases. The RAD program provides PHAs the opportunity to convert units subsidized under HUD's public housing program and owned by the PHAs to properties with long-term (typically, 15\u201320 years) project-based vouchers or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts. These are two forms of Section 8 rental assistance that tie the assistance to the unit to provide subsidized housing to low-income residents. The RAD program is currently fully subscribed with all 225,000 units allocated. As of September 30, 2017, 689 conversions were closed that involved a total of 74,709 units. Additionally, 706 conversions were in the process of structuring conversion plans. The RAD program is currently fully subscribed with all 225,000 units allocated. As of September 30, 2017, 689 conversions were closed that involved a total of 74,709 units. Most RAD conversions involved some type of construction. GAO's analysis of HUD data showed that as of September 30, 2017 417 of 689 closed RAD conversions (61 percent) involved planned rehabilitation to the property, 86 (12 percent) new construction, and 186 (27 percent) no construction; and 361 of 706 active RAD conversions (51 percent) involved planned rehabilitation, 89 (13 percent) new construction, and 256 (36 percent) no construction. HUD officials stated that they approve conversions that involve no immediate planned rehabilitation or new construction as long as the property has no immediate needs to be addressed. Such conversions allow PHAs to better position themselves to access additional capital to address future rehabilitation or construction plans. HUD's RAD leverage ratio\u2014the amount of private capital leveraged as a result of RAD conversions\u2014may not be accurately calculated, partly because final (postcompletion) financial information is not used. HUD's most recent leverage ratio in fiscal year 2017 was 19:1, nearly double what the agency reported the prior year. HUD officials acknowledged that the methodology used to calculate the leverage ratio is not consistent with the statutory requirement that the ratio reflect the amount of private-sector leveraging. HUD officials stated that they disagreed with the methodology used in the RAD authorizing statute and stated that there are various ways to calculate leverage. For the purposes of announcing the most recent leverage ratio in 2017, HUD officials decided that a leverage ratio comparing federally appropriated public housing resources would reflect the amount of financing leveraged had RAD not existed. HUD's leverage ratio, published in May 2017, did not manually adjust funding source data to accurately account for all sources in calculating the leverage ratio. Specifically, HUD did not isolate funding sources that were federally appropriated, contributed by the PHA, or contributed by state or local municipalities to calculate leverage. HUD officials stated that they are reviewing final closing packages to confirm that the data reflect the latest reported information on sources and uses of funds for each conversion at closing. However, sources and uses of funds at the time the RAD conversion is closed may differ from amounts upon completion of construction. In October 2017, HUD implemented procedures to verify completion of planned construction activities and costs, but does not collect final comprehensive financial data. HUD officials told GAO that the agency has not systematically tracked or analyzed household data on residents in RAD-converted units that are available from its public housing or Section 8 databases or from PHAs or other postconversion owners\u2014the main sources of resident data for the RAD program. In addition, HUD has",
    "gao_GAO-18-269": "Why GAO Did This Study The FFE is the federal exchange for health insurance that provides a single point of access for eligible individuals to enroll in qualified health plans. The exchange is operated by CMS, which is responsible for determining an individual's eligibility for coverage and income-based federal subsidies, enrolling the individual, and processing subsequent coverage changes or terminations. Issuers are responsible for collecting premiums from enrollees, arranging for coverage through provider networks, and paying claims. Issuers are also responsible for processing, and notifying CMS of, terminations related to nonpayment of premiums or fraud. GAO was asked to review the extent to which (1) federally facilitated exchange (FFE) enrollees maintained continuous coverage throughout 2015, and (2) CMS's data on terminations of enrollee coverage due to nonpayment of premiums are complete and accurate. GAO analyzed 2015 data on FFE enrollees' coverage and demographics, and interviewed CMS officials and issuers. What GAO Found About 4.9 million FFE enrollees maintained continuous coverage throughout 2015\u2014that is, their coverage began between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and lasted through December 31, 2015. These individuals therefore had 10 or more months of continuous coverage, with an average length of coverage of 11.6 months. Most of these enrollees (83 percent) re-enrolled in coverage by June 2016. The remaining 4.3 million enrollees (47 percent of the FFE enrollees in 2015) did not maintain continuous FFE coverage throughout the year, as defined above. The average length of coverage for these enrollees was about 5.0 months and, for most (72 percent), coverage ended prior to the end of the year. CMS's data on terminations of enrollee coverage due to nonpayment of premiums are not complete and accurate. CMS officials told GAO that they collect some information from issuers on their terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums. When issuers terminate policies, the inbound transaction files they send to CMS must include, among other elements, a revised coverage end date taking the termination into account. CMS uploads these data into its centralized FFE enrollment system. However, while the issuers may also include codes that designate the reasons for the terminations, there is no requirement for them to consistently do so. Data on reasons for termination are not tracked because they are not critical to ensure the accuracy of APTC payments\u2014which is the main function of the reconciliation process. Officials stated that key essential variables that CMS does track are whether coverage is effectuated (that is, whether the first premium payment has been made), whether the enrollee is eligible for APTC payments, and whether coverage was terminated. In addition, when issuers do report termination reason codes, these data are not always accurate. Specifically, CMS officials told GAO that, historically, issuers may have incorrectly used the nonpayment termination code for other types of terminations, and two issuers GAO interviewed acknowledged having done so. GAO compared data on terminations for nonpayment from CMS's centralized enrollment system with data GAO obtained from three issuers for a small selection of enrollees. GAO found that for one large issuer operating in multiple states, the CMS data indicated that coverage for 18 of the 26 enrollees that GAO examined had been terminated for nonpayment of premiums, while the issuer data indicated that coverage had been terminated for other reasons, in most cases because it had expired at the end of the year. The issuer indicated that it likely reported these year-end terminations to CMS incorrectly as terminations for nonpayment of premiums. CMS has recently taken actions that may improve the reliability of data on terminations for nonpayment, but these actions do not ensure the data are consistently reported and recorded by CMS. Specifically, in July 2017, CMS indicated that it would add new codes to the transaction files for issuers to use to help prevent inaccurate reporting of the nonpayment termination code. CMS officials stated that the agency is in the initial stages of exploring whether this would be feasible for CMS and issuers, but that it will require significant resources and time to develop. Although CMS's recent changes may improve its data, they do not ensure the agency will have complete and transparent data on terminations for nonpayment of premiums. According to federal internal control standards, federal agencies should obtain and use relevant, reliable data to achieve their objectives. Without complete and accurate data, CMS may be allowing enrollees who lost exchange coverage for nonpayment of premiums to re-enroll under SEPs although, under federal regulations, these individuals are ineligible to do so. Issuers reported that this had occurred. CMS officials stated",
    "gao_GAO-18-629T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for a wide range of maritime safety and security activities, including icebreakers, patrol boats, and vessels. The Coast Guard has a history of using its annual budgets to plan its acquisition portfolio, which leads to ever changing priorities and creates deferred acquisitions. This bow wave has begun and the Coast Guard will continue to add to it until it begins to have a longer-term focus, such as with the creation of the 20-year Long Term Major Acquisition Plan. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard has effectively managed its acquisition portfolio, (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard has conducted oversight of its acquisition portfolio, and (3) the extent to which the Coast Guard is sustaining its assets. This statement is based on GAO's July 2018 report on the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio and selected updates conducted in July 2018. What GAO Found The Coast Guard faces challenges in effectively managing its acquisition portfolio. GAO found in September 2012, and in its July 2018 review, that the Coast Guard's approach of relying on the annual budget process and the 5-year Capital Investment Plan (CIP) to manage portfolio affordability does not provide the best basis for making decisions to develop a more balanced and affordable portfolio in the long term. Further, in June 2014, GAO found that there is no evidence that short-term budget decisions will result in a good long-term strategy, and the Coast Guard's annual budget-driven trade-off approach creates constant churn as program baselines must continually re-align with budget realities instead of budgets being formulated to support program baselines. This situation results in trade-off decisions between capability and cost being pushed into the future. For example, since 2010, the Coast Guard has a stated requirement for three medium polar icebreakers, but it has only one operational medium icebreaker, the Healy, which has an expected end of service life\u2014the total period for which an asset is designed to operate\u2014in 2029. Despite the requirement for three medium polar icebreakers, Coast Guard officials said they are not currently assessing acquisition of the medium polar icebreakers because they are focusing on the heavy icebreaker acquisition and plan to assess the costs and benefits of acquiring medium polar icebreakers at a later time. The 5-year CIP is the Coast Guard's key acquisition portfolio planning tool. However, in GAO's July 2018 review, GAO found that shortcomings of that plan that limit its effectiveness. Specifically, GAO found that the Coast Guard's 5-year CIPs continue to demonstrate a pattern of certain ineffective planning practices, such as not identifying priorities or trade-offs between acquisition programs and not providing information about the effect of current decisions on the overall affordability of the acquisition portfolio. These shortcomings limit the Coast Guard's ability to manage the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. The Coast Guard has a management body\u2014the Executive Oversight Council\u2014in place to conduct oversight of its major acquisition programs; however, this management body has not conducted oversight across the entire acquisition portfolio using a comprehensive, collective approach. GAO found in July 2018 that the Coast Guard revised the council's charter in June 2017, removing this responsibility. Instead, Executive Oversight Council officials indicated that the council facilitates a balanced and affordable portfolio of acquisition programs through the individual program-level reviews. GAO continues to believe that in addition to long-term planning, the Executive Oversight Council should include the major acquisition portfolio's budget realities faced by the Coast Guard in its reviews, or long-term affordability. The Coast Guard's heavy polar icebreaker program's optimistic schedule is driven by capability gap rather than knowledge-based analysis. GAO found in July 2018 that the Coast Guard's heavy polar icebreaker program is currently either approaching or operating beyond the end of their design service lives. These cutters are in need of major maintenance overhauls\u2014or Service Life Extension Projects (SLEP)\u2014in order to continue providing capabilities to operators. According to Coast Guard officials, SLEPs are necessary because the Coast Guard does not have the funds available to initiate a new major acquisition program to recapitalize these assets in the short term, or because a significant amount of maintenance work is required to keep these assets operational until replacements are fielded. These planned SLEPs involve several risks including scheduling and funding. The Coast Guard operates two fleets of Medium Endurance Cutters (270-foot and 210-foot cutters) and both are either approaching or have exceeded their design service lives. According to Coast Guard officials, there are no plans to extend the service lives of the 210-foot Medium Endurance Cutters due to the age of the vessels",
    "gao_GAO-19-162": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing U.S.-bound air cargo, including passenger and all-cargo air carriers. TSA inspects air carriers and assesses foreign airports to help ensure compliance with TSA security requirements. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo. This report (1) describes steps TSA takes to help ensure that U.S.-bound air cargo is secure, (2) describes the status of TSA's efforts to recognize and monitor foreign governments' air cargo security programs, and (3) analyzes the extent to which TSA measures the effectiveness of its efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo. GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials, air carrier representatives, and foreign government officials. GAO also conducted site visits to two foreign airports that transport U.S.-bound air cargo to the United States. What GAO Found To help ensure compliance with cargo security requirements and international standards, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) inspects air carriers and assesses certain known consignors and regulated agents. TSA also inspects cargo security procedures during foreign airport assessments. Further, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also implemented requirements to obtain advance information on air cargo shipments through ACAS that it uses to perform targeted risk assessments. TSA has recognized the passenger air cargo security programs of the European Union and 12 other countries and monitors their implementation. TSA has also recognized the all-cargo portions of the European Union national cargo security program (NCSP) and has revalidated all recognized NCSPs at least once since fiscal year 2012. TSA has taken steps to broadly measure the effectiveness of its air carrier inspections and foreign airport assessments, but these efforts do not allow TSA to specifically determine the effectiveness of the cargo portions of such inspections or assessments. For example, TSA developed a new performance measure to track the extent to which foreign airports take actions to address noncompliance issues identified by TSA inspectors during foreign airport assessments. However, that performance measure does not allow TSA to determine the effectiveness of the cargo portions of airport assessments because it does not separately account for cargo and noncargo noncompliance issues. Developing and monitoring outcome-based performance measures for the cargo portions of airport assessments and differentiating the extent to which air carriers correct violations related to cargo from those related to passengers as it develops and monitors outcome-based performance measures for its air carrier inspection program could help TSA better assess the effectiveness of these efforts and whether they are improving the security of U.S.-bound air cargo. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that TSA (1) develop and monitor outcome-based performance measures for the cargo portions of foreign airport assessments and (2) differentiate the extent to which air carriers correct violations related to cargo from those related to passengers as it develops and monitors outcome-based performance measures for its air carrier inspection program. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-364": "Why GAO Did This Study The Marine Corps is developing a new ACV, which is intended to replace the AAV. The ACV is a tracked vehicle with capability to launch from ships to reach the shore carrying up to 21 Marines at a speed of up to approximately 6 knots. The Marine Corps is also developing a new ACV increment, which is scheduled to begin in February 2019. The ACV program is a two-phase strategy for selecting a contractor to produce the ACV fleet. In the first phase, the program issued a solicitation for offerors to submit proposals and provided for award of multiple contracts for each contractor to design and develop 16 prototypes for performance assessment. In the second phase, referred to as the down-select process, after testing the prototypes, the Marine Corps intends to select a single contractor to continue into the production phase. The Marine Corps received five initial proposals and ultimately awarded contracts to BAE and SAIC to develop the ACV prototypes. The Marine Corps considered the ACV to be a substantially non-developmental item because both contractors' designs were based on vehicles that were already in production and deployed by other militaries. The Marine Corps has made no major changes to the ACV acquisition schedule since GAO previously reported on the program in April 2017. This report examines (1) the status of the ACV program's development and acquisition, (2) the extent to which the ACV program is on track to meet cost goals, and (3) the extent to which the ACV program is considering entering production without meeting established best practices for manufacturing maturity. GAO reviewed the ACV program's development and acquisition documents and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The Marine Corps' ACV program is on track to meet cost goals established at the start of development, based on a recent Navy estimate, the ACV program office, and reporting from the contractors. In September 2017, the ACV program's Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Report for ACV provided a Navy cost estimate for development of $750.7 million, less than the $810.5 million baseline established at the start of development in November 2015. Program officials also indicated that the ACV program was on track to meet cost goals. They noted that the contractors have not contacted the government to negotiate an increase in billing prices, as of December 2017. Since both of the contractors have delivered all 16 of their required prototypes and the manufacturing of the prototypes is the largest anticipated portion of ACV development contract costs, most of the costs associated with the manufacturing of the prototypes have likely been realized. The Marine Corps has made no major changes to the ACV acquisition schedule since GAO previously reported on the program in April 2017. The ACV program office is in the process of conducting tests and assessments to determine if the program is on track to meet the criteria to enter production, but program officials told GAO the Navy\u2014which has the authority to approve major acquisition milestone decisions for the program\u2014may choose to start low-rate production without meeting established best practices for manufacturing maturity. At the start of development, DOD established criteria for entering production in areas such as capability performance and the status of the contractors' manufacturing readiness to manufacture the ACV vehicles. Leading up to the production decision, the program is engaged in a number of activities such as the operational assessment and production readiness review to inform the decision to enter production. The production readiness review has a critical role in informing the decision to enter production because it represents an opportunity for the program to determine the maturity of the contractor's manufacturing process and assess potential risks related to cost, schedule, or performance. GAO's previous reviews about manufacturing best practices found that identifying manufacturing risks early in the acquisition cycle and assessing those risks prior to key decision points, such as the decision to enter production, reduces the likelihood of cost growth and potential delays. The ACV program has used the DOD Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) Deskbook to identify levels of manufacturing capability and establish targets for minimal levels of manufacturing readiness at specific acquisition milestones. The MRL Deskbook recommends that a program is expected to demonstrate a MRL of 8 by the time of the low-rate production decision. However, GAO's previously identified best practices for managing manufacturing risks recommend programs reach a higher level\u2014MRL-9\u2014for the risk area of process capability and control before entering low-rate production. The program office confirmed that the MRL criterion for entering production is to achieve an MRL-8 but noted that it is possible that the program could choose to enter production without an overall MRL-8. Program officials stated that they will keep the review open until April 2018, at which point the program will make a determination about the contractors' manufacturing readiness levels. The program office confirmed that the MRL criterion for entering production is to achieve an MRL-8 but noted that it is possible that the program could choose to",
    "gao_GAO-18-194": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has historically faced organizational and management challenges that can limit effective and efficient coordination across the department. Congress required DOD to develop an organizational strategy to advance a collaborative culture across the department and create cross-functional teams to address critical objectives and outputs. Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 required GAO to review DOD's efforts to establish cross-functional teams. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's draft organizational strategy addresses statutory elements and (2) the extent to which DOD has developed, but not provided, training for its presidential appointees and cross-functional team members. GAO reviewed DOD's draft organizational strategy and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Office of the Secretary of Defense's (DOD) Chief Management Officer (CMO) developed a draft organizational strategy that addresses the two statutory elements required under section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017\u2014identifying critical objectives and outputs that would benefit from the use of cross-functional teams, and providing for the appropriate use of these teams\u2014but DOD has not issued that strategy as required by September 1, 2017. In addition, while the draft strategy contains the two required elements, it does not outline how DOD will achieve several future outcomes required under section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 that are designed to advance a collaborative culture within the department. Further, ODCMO officials did not coordinate with key stakeholders, such as the Secretary of Defense, military departments, and defense agencies, in developing the organizational strategy. GAO's leading practices for collaboration highlight the value of agencies including stakeholders when defining and articulating a common outcome. DOD has established one Secretary of Defense-empowered cross-functional team, and draft team guidance addresses most statutory elements and leading practices. The draft guidance fully addresses six and partially addresses one of the statutory elements. GAO also found that the draft guidance partially addresses two leading practices, partially addresses two leading practices, and does not address one leading practice for effective cross-functional teams. DOD has developed, but not provided, training for its presidential appointees and cross-functional team members, and it does not address all statutory requirements. As of October 2017, the ODCMO developed a draft training curriculum on cross-functional teams for presidential appointees, but this curriculum does not address all statutory requirements. Furthermore, as of February 2018, 22 individuals have been nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and appointed to positions within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, but none have received training required by section 911. Without the provision of training for top leadership within the Office of the Secretary of Defense that includes the required elements in section 911 or developing criteria for obtaining a waiver from providing the training, DOD may have difficulty implementing its new organizational strategy as top leadership commitment is a key element of an organizational transformation. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) obtain stakeholder input on the development of the draft organizational strategy, (2) provide training for presidential appointees to positions within the Office of the Secretary of Defense that includes the required elements, and (3) develop criteria for obtaining a waiver from providing the training. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",

This report examines (1) the extent to which VAMCs have documented and conducted reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns were raised and (2) the extent to which selected VAMCs reported providers to the NPDB and SLBs in accordance with VHA policy. GAO reviewed VHA policy and guidance, interviewed VAMC officials, and analyzed VHA data on the number of providers reported to the NPDB and SLBs. What GAO Found GAO found that the five selected Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers (VAMC) collectively required reviews of 148 providers' clinical care after concerns were raised from October 2013 through March 2017, but VAMC officials were unable to provide documentation that almost half of these reviews were conducted. GAO found that all five VAMCs lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told GAO they conducted, and in some cases the required reviews were not conducted at all. GAO also found that VHA does not adequately oversee VAMC reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, including ensuring that these reviews are completed and documented in a timely manner. VHA policy requires VAMCs to alert certain entities if there are serious concerns about a provider's clinical performance. VHA policy assigns reporting responsibility and authority to the VAMC director, who generally delegates the task of reporting to other VAMC officials. VHA makes this information available to other health care entities through two distinct reporting processes: the National Provider Data Bank (NPDB) and the Special Litigation Bureau (SLB). Under VHA policy, VAMC directors are required to report to the NPDB any adverse privileging action the facility takes that 1) affects the clinical privileges of a provider for a period longer than 30 days and 2) is related to professional incompetence or professional misconduct. VHA policy requires VAMCs to report providers who so substantially failed to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice as to raise reasonable concern for the safety of patients. VHA policy requires VAMCs to report providers who so substantially failed to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice as to raise reasonable concern for the safety of patients.

VHA policy requires VAMCs to report providers who so substantially failed to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice as to raise reasonable concern for the safety of patients. VHA policy does not require the VISNs to oversee whether VAMCs are reporting providers to the NPDB or SLBs when warranted. As a result, VHA facilitates providers who provide substandard care obtaining privileges at other VAMCs or a hospital outside of VA's health care system without an indication on their record that an adverse privileging action was taken against them or that they resigned or retired while under investigation. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA specify in VHA policy that reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised should be documented, including retrospective and comprehensive reviews; that VISN officials oversee VAMC reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, including retrospective and comprehensive reviews; and that VISN officials oversee VAMCs to ensure that they are reporting providers to the NPDB and SLBs, and are reporting in a timely manner.

In September 2017, GAO reported that the high-risk designation was a symptomatic of systemic management weaknesses. GAO was asked to testify on the status of the high-risk list. This statement addresses (1) the status of the high-risk designation and actions taken to address it, (2) the extent to which the agencies have addressed the management weaknesses that led to the 2017 designation, and (3) the extent to which the agencies have addressed the management weaknesses that led to the 2017 designation. This statement is based on GAO's February 2017 High Risk List update and ongoing work. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and Indian Health Service (IHS) have made some progress in addressing management weaknesses that led to the 2017 High Risk List designation. However, additional progress is needed for the agencies to fully address the criteria and related management weaknesses, particularly in the areas of leadership commitment and capacity. For example, Indian Affairs' leaders have demonstrated commitment to addressing key weaknesses in the management of BIE schools in several ways. For example, the BIE Director formed an internal working group, convened meetings with other senior leaders within Indian Affairs, and publicly stated that his agency is committed to ensuring implementation of GAO's recommendations on Indian education. However, it is important that Indian Affairs leaders be able to sustain this level of commitment to solving problems in Indian education. In addition, Indian Affairs' leaders have demonstrated leadership commitment by regularly meeting with GAO to discuss the agency's progress in addressing GAO's recommendations. However, IHS still does not have permanent leadership\u2014including a Director of IHS\u2014which is necessary for the agency to demonstrate its commitment to improvement. In addition, Indian Affairs has not developed a workforce plan to address staffing and training gaps with key staff. In addition, BIE and other Indian Affairs offices that support BIE schools have not developed a workforce plan to address staffing and training gaps with key staff. In addition, BIE and other Indian Affairs offices that support BIE schools have not developed a workforce plan to address staffing and training gaps with key staff. In addition, BIE and other Indian Affairs offices that support BIE schools have not developed a workforce plan to address staffing and training gaps with key staff.

    "gao_GAO-18-48": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is a large and complex entity with a demanding responsibility to achieve its mission. The federal government has a long history of misconduct, including retaliation for whistleblowing. GAO was asked to examine the process for addressing misconduct and to identify any challenges in removing employees for misconduct. This report examines (1) the process that agencies are generally required to follow in responding to employee misconduct in the federal service; (2) alternative approaches to the formal legal process that agencies can use to respond to misconduct, and assess what factors affect agencies' responses; (3) describe trends in removals and other adverse actions resulting from misconduct; and (4) identify key steps agencies can take to help them better prevent and address misconduct. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and OPM regulations; analyzed OPM data from fiscal years 2006 to 2016; and interviewed OPM, MSPB, and subject-matter experts. What GAO Found Most agencies are required to adhere to formal, statutorily established guidelines under Title 5 of the U.S. Code (herein Chapter 75) when taking adverse actions against an employee for misconduct. Chapter 75 contains two subsections that outline the requirements for (1) non-appealable adverse actions such as suspensions of 14 days or less or (2) appealable adverse actions such as reductions in pay or grade, suspensions of more than 14 days, and removals. Agencies may take an adverse action under Chapter 75 only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. Agencies may also take an adverse action under Chapter 75 only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. Agencies may use progressive discipline to help determine which course of action to take when responding to misconduct. Agencies may choose to offer alternative discipline at any stage of the disciplinary process. According to MSPB, agencies may choose to offer alternative discipline at any stage of the disciplinary process. OPM officials said alternative disciplines tend to be more focused on taking a corrective or remedial response rather than punitive actions against an employee. According to subject-matter experts, alternative discipline approaches are not appropriate for egregious acts of misconduct or when the employee is remorseless but rather lower level offenses where an employee may show remorse for the misconduct and demonstrate that she or she can be rehabilitated. According to MSPB, alternative discipline approaches are not appropriate for egregious acts of misconduct or when the employee is remorseless but rather lower level offenses where an employee may show remorse for the misconduct and demonstrate that she or she can be rehabilitated. According to subject-matter experts, agency managers and supervisors may be able to effectively resolve employee misconduct cases through the use of alternative approaches, which can shorten the timeline and simplify the adverse action process in a manner that has the most potential to prevent additional harm to the workplace and avoid the potentially high costs of litigating a misconduct case. GAO's analysis of Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data from fiscal years 2006 to 2016 shows that, on average, agencies disciplined approximately 17,000 or less than 1 percent of the federal workforce per year under Subchapter II of Chapter 75. The number of employees who separate from the federal workforce for misconduct under alternative means, such as settlements, is not known and would not be recorded as misconduct in OPM's Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) database, according to agency officials and experts. OPM collects data on personnel actions reported by most agencies and stores this information in the EHRI database, but these data could be improved to provide OPM with better information to help agencies address misconduct. Because not all misconduct data are entered into the database, the data presented in this report do not represent the entirety of employee misconduct instances that occur in the federal government. OPM officials said they do not have a sense of how frequently agencies use these (and other non-specific nature of action) codes for misconduct-related actions. Without maintaining comprehensive data regarding the extent and nature of misconduct in the federal government, OPM risks missing opportunities to provide agencies with guidance and other tools, such as targeted training to help agencies better address cases of misconduct. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OPM explore the feasibility of improving the quality of data on employee misconduct by providing additional guidance to agencies on how to record instances of misconduct in OPM's databases. OPM partially concurred with the recommendations, but did not concur with one recommendation. GAO maintains that the recommendations are valid as discussed in the report.",

The Bureau has fundamentally re-examined its approach for conducting the 2020 Census. Specifically, its plan for 2020 includes four broad innovation areas (re-engineering field operations, using administrative records, verifying addresses in-office, and developing an Internet self-response option). GAO was asked to review the Bureau's progress in implementing these innovations. This statement addresses (1) the Bureau's plans for 2020, (2) the challenges the Bureau faces in implementing and managing key IT systems, and (3) the reliability of the Bureau's 2020 Census cost estimate. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on the Bureau's efforts to re-examine its approach for conducting the 2020 Census. GAO reviewed the Bureau's plans for 2020, interviewed Bureau officials, and visited three test sites. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) plans to use four innovation areas for the 2020 Census: re-engineering field operations, using administrative records, verifying addresses in-office, and developing an Internet self-response option. The Bureau has estimated that these innovations could result in savings of over $5 billion (in 2020 dollars) when compared to its estimates of the cost for conducting the census with traditional methods. However, the innovations also introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at all. GAO's prior work has shown the importance of the Bureau conducting a robust testing program, including the 2018 Census Test. However, because of funding uncertainty the Bureau canceled the field components of the 2017 Census Test, including non-response follow-up, a key census operation. In May 2017, the Bureau scaled back the operational scope of the 2018 End-to-End Test and, of the three planned test sites, only the Rhode Island site would fully implement the 2018 End-to-End Test. The Bureau also plans to use administrative records to support quality control during its non-response field enumeration. However, the Bureau has not developed cost and quality information on address canvassing projects, and detailed information on cost tradeoffs was not available when GAO requested it. The Bureau continues to face challenges in managing and overseeing IT programs, systems, and contractors supporting the 2020 Census. Specifically, it has been challenged in managing schedules, costs, contracts, and governance and internal coordination for its IT systems. As a result of these challenges, the Bureau is at risk of being unable to fully implement key IT systems necessary to support the 2020 Census. GAO has previously recommended that the Bureau take action to improve its implementation and management of IT in areas such as governance and internal coordination. GAO also has ongoing work reviewing each of these areas. The Bureau's October 2015 update of its life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census did not conform to the four characteristics that constitute best practices, and, as a result, the estimate was unreliable. Cost estimates that appropriately account for risks facing an agency can help an agency manage large, complex activities like the 2020 Census, as well as help Congress make funding decisions and provide oversight. Cost estimates are also necessary to inform decisions to fund one program over another, to develop annual budget requests, to determine what resources are needed, and to develop baselines for measuring performance. In June 2016, GAO reported that, although the Bureau had taken steps to improve its capacity to carry out an effective cost estimate, its October 2015 update of its life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census did not conform to the four characteristics that constitute best practices, and, as a result, the estimate was unreliable.

From 2014 through 2017, SBA determined that 4 to 7 small businesses did not meet the benchmark each year and placed those businesses on a list of those ineligible to receive certain additional awards. However, GAO found instances in which the data used to generate the list were inaccurate or incomplete. For example, GAO identified more than 2,700 small businesses that had multiple records with different spellings of the same business's name. SBA officials told GAO that the quality of the award information in the database has been an issue, and that accurate information is important because small businesses may avoid being identified as subject to the benchmark if their business names and identification numbers are different across multiple records. SBA and the participating agencies do not know the extent to which small businesses are meeting the Commercialization Benchmark because SBA and the participating agencies have assessed businesses against the benchmark only once, in 2014, when SBA determined that 12 businesses did not meet the benchmark. This is in part because, according to officials from SBA and several agencies, they cannot collect and verify the accuracy of the data needed to implement the benchmark as written. Working together to find a way to implement the benchmark as designed or revise it so that it can be implemented could allow the agencies to fulfill the requirement in the Small Business Act to evaluate whether small businesses have met a minimum performance standard for commercializing their technology. SBA and the participating agencies have provided inconsistent information to small businesses about the consequence of not meeting the benchmarks. SBA officials told GAO that they and the participating agencies sought to change how to implement the consequence because of SBA's and agencies' difficulties in implementing the benchmarks. SBA and the participating agencies agreed to change how the consequence would be implemented, starting in 2017, so that small businesses that do not meet the benchmarks are ineligible to submit proposals, according to SBA officials. As of November 2017, however, the information available about this new way to implement the consequence was inconsistent because some of the agencies had not updated their project solicitations. Specifically, information in the most recent project solicitations available at that time for 2 agencies and one subunit of an agency stated that businesses that do not meet the benchmarks are ineligible to submit certain proposals, consistent with the revised approach for how to implement the consequence. However, the most recent project solicitations available at that time for 7 other agencies and the other subunit of the agency stated that those businesses that do not meet the benchmarks are ineligible to receive certain awards, consistent with the prior approach for how to implement the consequence. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that SBA work with participating agencies to improve the reliability of its SBIR and STTR award data and revise the benchmark so that it can be implemented. SBA agreed with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-211": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for executing the global war on terrorism. DOD's overseas contingency operations (OCO) are the largest and most complex operations in the world. Congress appropriates funds for DOD's OCO and base activities through appropriations. Congress also has the discretion to make available OCO and base funding through OCO appropriations. GAO was asked to review DOD's processes for separating the funding of OCO and base amounts. This report describes (1) selected DOD components' use of internal controls to separately account for OCO and base amounts, and (2) alternatives to the current processes that Congress and DOD use to separate funding for DOD's OCO and base activities. GAO reviewed documentation of DOD components' use of internal controls to separate OCO and base amounts. GAO also interviewed DOD officials and subject matter experts. What GAO Found The DOD components in GAO's review use coding and other internal control activities to separately account for OCO and base amounts in their operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts during budget execution. To record and track OCO and base amounts separately, the DOD components use coding in their financial systems during the allotment, obligation, and disbursement of funds. For example, during the allotment phase, the Army and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency use codes in their financial systems to divide, distribute, and track their appropriated funds into separate categories\u2014including one for OCO and one for base. The Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Navy use specific codes to track OCO transactions within multiple systems they use to allot and obligate OCO and base amounts. GAO identified some internal control activities that the DOD components in GAO's review have put into place to ensure separate accounting of OCO and base amounts, such as controls over information processing. GAO identified at least four alternatives to the current processes that Congress and DOD use to separate funding for DOD's OCO and base activities. Each alternative would require action at different phases of DOD's budget process and entail tradeoffs. For example, adding specific purpose language would better align obligation of OCO amounts with congressional intent; however, doing so could also reduce DOD's financial flexibility and responsiveness to changes in operations. Understanding the implications of each alternative is important to avoid unintended consequences. GAO summarized the positive and negative aspects of the alternatives reported by respondents to a questionnaire that GAO sent to Congress and DOD. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments on the draft report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-557": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars on airlift services, including airlift cargo, military aircraft, and commercial aircraft. The TWCF is a component of the Air Force Working Capital Fund, which is used to provide airlift services to support DOD operations. The TWCF is authorized to establish airlift customer rates to be competitive with commercial air carriers. Due to mobilization requirements, the resulting revenue does not always cover the full costs of airlift operations. GAO was asked to review the ARA. This report examines (1) the extent to which ARA funds were requested, allotted, and expended by the Air Force from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, and the annual amounts expended by the Air Force; (2) the extent to which the Air Force provided ARA information in its budget request to Congress and informed its request with information from TRANSCOM; and (3) the extent to which TRANSCOM has implemented a process to set rates for airlift services and use workload forecasts to estimate the annual ARA funding request. GAO analyzed budget and financial data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and interviewed officials from the Air Force and TRANSCOM. What GAO Found The Air Force requested, allotted, and expended billions of dollars for the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) for fiscal years 2007 through 2017. These amounts varied annually, in some cases, by hundreds of millions of dollars. GAO's analysis of Air Force and TRANSCOM budget and financial information showed that for fiscal years 2007 through 2017, the Air Force requested $2.8 billion from Congress for ARA requirements, as part of its annual Operations and Maintenance appropriation. The Air Force allotted $2.8 billion (i.e., directed the use of the appropriated funds) and expended $2.4 billion of the ARA appropriated funds. During this period, the total allotted amount was about $400 million dollars more than the expended amount. According to Air Force officials, this $400 million was used to pay for other Air Force readiness priorities. The Air Force budget requests include some information on the ARA but omit details provided in budget requests prior to fiscal year 2010. Air Force budget officials stated that the ARA budget information that was included for fiscal years 2007 through 2009 was changed for the fiscal year 2010 budget request as part of a DOD initiative to reduce the overall number of budget line items. For fiscal years 2007 through 2009, the ARA amount was explicitly stated in the budget justification documents as part of a separate subactivity group line item. For fiscal years 2010 through 2017, the ARA amount was bundled with funding requests for other training requirements in the Air Force Operations and Maintenance budget justification documents, thus omitting specific details with respect to the ARA. Without establishing specific requirements to present detailed ARA information in the annual Air Force Operations and Maintenance budget request, DOD and congressional decision-makers do not have sufficient information to make informed decisions about the level of funding necessary to cover airlift costs not recovered by the rates charged by TRANSCOM. TRANSCOM has not provided ARA estimates in time to inform Air Force budget requests. Air Force officials stated that they need to have TRANSCOM's estimates by mid-June to be able to conduct analysis to strengthen confidence in the ARA budget request and obtain senior leadership approval. The Air Force submits its Operations and Maintenance annual budget request to DOD in early July. However, TRANSCOM was not providing its ARA estimate until August. As a result, Air Force officials stated they have been developing their own ARA estimate based on historical average trends because they have not received information from TRANSCOM on time. TRANSCOM has a rate-setting process for airlift services, but producing accurate workload forecasts is challenging. GAO's analysis of TRANSCOM data showed that the airlift forecasting process produced increasingly inaccurate projections of actual workload. Producing accurate forecasts is challenging because TRANSCOM has not fully implemented: (1) an effective process to gather workload projections from its customers (i.e., military services) to inform its forecasts, (2) forecasting goals and metrics and the review of its performance, and (3) an action plan to improve workload forecasting. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense (1) establish requirements to present detailed ARA information in the annual Air Force Operations and Maintenance budget request, (2) finalize the memorandum of understanding to improve the timing and communication of budgetary information from TRANSCOM, and (3) fully implement a process to gather projected workload information from its customers, use forecast accuracy metrics and goals to monitor its performance, and develop a corrective action plan to improve workload forecasting. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-389": "Why GAO Did This Study The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne disease that can cause permanent death and death. The Zika virus is transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or around the time of birth, or from person-to-person through sexual contact or blood transfusion. The Zika virus is primarily transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, but can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or around the time of birth, or from person-to-person through sexual contact or blood transfusion. In April 2016, the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced that they had identified $589 million\u2014$510 million of it from existing Ebola virus disease resources within HHS, the Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2014that could quickly be redirected and spent on immediate efforts to control and respond to the spread of the Zika virus. In September 2016, Congress appropriated $932 million to HHS and its agencies in the Zika Response and Preparedness Act. Of that amount, $394 million was appropriated directly to CDC and $152 million was appropriated directly to NIH. The remainder was appropriated to HHS's PHSSEF, from which HHS allocated $245 million to BARDA within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, $75 million to CMS, and $66 million to HRSA. GAO was asked to review the Zika supplemental funding. This report examines (1) the extent to which HHS agencies have obligated the Zika supplemental funding, and the extent to which the agencies have disbursed the funding; and (2) the types of activities selected awardees have funded using Zika supplemental funding, and the experiences awardees had applying for and managing the funding. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed HHS officials and selected awardees. GAO also interviewed CDC, CMS, HRSA, and NIH officials. What GAO Found The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies have obligated nearly all of the Zika supplemental funding as of September 30, 2017, primarily through cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts. HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) obligated 100 percent of its Zika supplemental funding, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) obligated over 99 percent of their funding. As of December 31, 2017, the HHS agencies had disbursed about 21 percent (approximately $195.5 million of $932 million) of the Zika supplemental funding. According to agency officials and selected awardees GAO spoke with, various factors can affect the disbursement of funding after obligation. These factors include time to draw down funding from the federal agencies, allowing for program implementation and a planning period, and awardees' internal administrative processes and unique characteristics. Selected awardees GAO spoke with used Zika supplemental funding for a variety of activities, and had varying experiences applying for and managing the funding. Collectively, the activities included four primary types: medical surveillance, vector control, laboratory capacity building, and providing health care services. For example, Florida used Zika supplemental funding for laboratory capacity and vector control activities, among other activities. Florida also used Zika supplemental funding for local vector control activities. Health care service activities for those selected awardees that received funding from CMS (Florida and Texas) included increasing access to contraceptive services for men and women; increasing access to and reducing barriers to diagnostic testing, screening, and counseling for pregnant women and newborns; and increasing access to appropriate specialized health care services for pregnant women, children born to mothers with maternal Zika virus infection, and their families. While a majority of the 12 selected awardees GAO spoke with reported positive experiences with the process of applying for and managing the Zika supplemental funding, some awardees cited aspects of the process that were challenging. For example, awardees said that various time frames among multiple awards and restrictions on authorized activities under the awards added administrative burdens that officials had to deal with while responding to the outbreak. In October 2017, CDC issued a new notice of funding opportunity that, according to agency officials, was intended to help minimize the administrative burden on these awardees (e.g., preparing applications and other paperwork) during significant public health emergencies by pre-approving public health departments in these jurisdictions to rapidly receive future awards. This new notice of funding opportunity will be used to establish a list of awardees, with existing emergency prepared",
    "gao_GAO-18-91": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies face mission-critical skills gaps that pose a risk to agencies' ability to cost effectively serve the public and achieve results. CHCO agencies use a range of special payment authorities to help address these challenges. GAO was asked to review the use of special payment authorities. This report (1) describes what is known about how much CHCO agencies used selected special payment authorities in fiscal years 2014-2016; (2) assesses the extent to which CHCO agencies evaluate the effectiveness of these authorities and identifies challenges, if any, the agencies reported facing in using the authorities to address mission-critical skills gap areas; and (3) evaluates how the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has helped agencies address federal recruitment and retention needs. GAO analyzed CHCO agency data for fiscal years 2014-2016, reviewed OPM and CHCO Council documents, and interviewed OPM and CHCO Council officials. What GAO Found Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) Council agencies used a range of special payment authorities to recruit and retain employees. GAO's analysis of CHCO agency data found that for six selected authorities, 20 or more agencies used each between fiscal years 2014-2016, as shown in the figure. Seven agencies reported having used the critical position pay authority. CHCO agencies reported using the special rates authority, recruitment incentives, and student loan repayment authorities to varying degrees. CHCO agencies reported that special payment authorities positively affected areas of operation, but few agencies documented their assessments of the effectiveness of the authorities. CHCO agencies reported that insufficient resources was the most common challenge they experienced in using special payment authorities. CHCO agencies most frequently reported that training for agency managers was a change that would very likely or certainly improve the agency's ability to effectively use special payment authorities. OPM has taken a number of steps to provide agencies with additional guidance and assistance on using special payment authorities, but has not analyzed whether the payment authorities help agencies to improve recruitment and retention government-wide. OPM collects agency data on the use of special payment authorities via annual reporting on certain authorities and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI), but has not analyzed whether the payment authorities help agencies to improve recruitment and retention government-wide. OPM officials said they collect data on the use of special rates, but have not analyzed whether the payment authorities help agencies to improve recruitment and retention government-wide. OPM officials said they have conversations with agency officials about their views on the process, but do not have procedures to systematically monitor or evaluate the process, such as to seek agency feedback on whether the approval processes are burdensome, complex, and a barrier to wider use. OPM officials said they have conversations with agency officials about their views on the process, but do not have procedures to systematically monitor or evaluate the process, such as to seek agency feedback on whether the approval processes are burdensome, complex, and a barrier to wider use. By not tracking and analyzing government-wide data on the use of special payment authorities, OPM and the CHCO Council do not have the information they need to help determine what potential changes may be needed, and have limited assurance that special payment authorities are helping agencies meet their needs and achieve recruitment and retention goals. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OPM track government-wide data to establish a baseline and analyze the extent to which the seven Title 5 special payment authorities are effective in improving employee recruitment and retention, and determine what potential changes may be needed to improve the seven authorities' effectiveness. OPM partially concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred with the second. GAO believes OPM could assist agencies by providing tools or other guidance for the authorities that OPM does not approve\u2014such as on establishing a business case, best practices, answers to frequently asked questions, or lessons learned\u2014to help ensure consistent information is shared with agencies to support effective use of the authorities.",
    "gao_GAO-18-300": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to submit an implementation plan to Congress for the new Joint Trauma System (JTS) in June 2017. The NDAA also required GAO to review DOD's plan. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's implementation plan includes the four elements required by the NDAA, and (2) the extent to which DOD's planning documents incorporate leading practices. GAO reviewed DOD's implementation plan and supplemental planning documents, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) implementation plan for the new JTS includes the four elements required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA). However, neither DOD's supplemental planning documents prepared to date fully incorporate leading practices, which GAO has previously identified. These leading practices, such as the establishment of goals and the identification of strategies to achieve those goals, play an important role in enabling an organization to achieve its objectives. GAO found that DOD's planning documents, prepared to date, incorporate only some of the leading practices. For example, the documents do not yet fully reflect the strategies needed to accomplish these goals, such as the resources and costs needed for implementation. Without including more complete information about plans to serve as a reference body for trauma care, it is unclear how well prepared DOD is to implement this element. The documents also do not yet fully identify risks that could affect the JTS's ability to serve as a trauma reference body, such as potential shortfalls in the DODTR's ability to support an increased number of users. Without planning for assessing and responding to risks, DOD may be unable to determine progress toward the goals it has identified for this element. The documents also do not yet fully incorporate leading practices related to strategies and risks. For example, the documents do not yet fully identify how DOD plans to assess progress made towards the goals for consolidating registries or developing a lexicon of common trauma terms, as would be consistent with leading practices. Without a fully-developed system for assessing the implementation's progress, DOD may be unable to determine progress toward the goals it has identified for this element. The documents also do not yet fully incorporate leading practices related to strategies and risks. For example, the documents do not yet fully identify how DOD plans to coordinate the translation of research from its centers of excellence into standards of clinical trauma care, as would be consistent with leading practices. Without additional planning to improve mechanisms for CPG development and dissemination, DOD faces uncertainty regarding the new JTS's ability to ensure that the CPGs it produces are up to date and effectively disseminated to military trauma care providers, which may ultimately impact the trauma care that it provides. Without additional planning to improve mechanisms for CPG development and dissemination, DOD faces uncertainty regarding the new JTS's ability to ensure that the CPGs it produces are up to date and effectively disseminated to military trauma care providers, which may ultimately impact the trauma care that it provides.

    "gao_GAO-19-54": "Why GAO Did This Study Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 requires DOD to revise the Defense Finance and Accounting Standards Regulation (DFARS) to require that the LPTA process be used in situations where there would not be any value on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. Section 813 also requires GAO to report on DOD's use of the LPTA process. This report examines (1) the number and percentage of contracts and orders competitively awarded by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA valued at $5 million and above in fiscal year 2017 and (2) the reasons contracting officials used the LPTA process. GAO reviewed the 46 contracts and orders for which the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA used the LPTA process and found that 20 were for products and 26 for services. GAO also interviewed DOD contracting officials. What GAO Found Based upon the results of GAO's generalizable sample, GAO estimates that about 26 percent of contracts and orders competitively awarded by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DLA valued at $5 million and above in fiscal year 2017 used the Low Price Tradeoff (LPTA) process. Contracting officials associated with the 14 contracts and orders GAO reviewed used the LPTA process, in part, because they determined there was no tradeoff available or determined that DOD would not derive any benefit from paying a premium for offers that exceeded the minimum capabilities. Contracting officials stated that they generally considered five of the eight criteria in Section 813 when awarding the 14 contracts and orders GAO reviewed. This was done, in part, because according to contracting officials, those criteria are inherently considered by contracting officials when determining which source selection process should be used. Further, based on GAO's analysis, these five criteria are generally reflected in DOD's March 2016 Source Selection Procedures. A Defense Pricing and Contracting official stated that the DFARS is in the process of being updated and will reflect Section 813. A DPC official stated that the DFARS is in the process of being updated and will reflect Section 813. A DPC official, however, could not comment on whether the revisions will provide clarification, beyond what was written in Section 813, on how to apply the two criteria that DOD contracting officials generally found confusing. Without further clarification, such confusion is likely to continue. As a result, contracting officials across DOD may not understand how to consistently apply these criteria when using the LPTA process. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) ensure that contracting officials address how contracting officials using the LPTA process should apply Section 813 criteria regarding procurement for goods that are predominantly expendable in nature, nontechnical, or have a short life expectancy or shelf life as revisions to the DFARS are considered; and (2) ensure that contracting officials address how contracting officials using the LPTA process should apply Section 813 criteria regarding full life-cycle costs, including for operations and support as revisions to the DFARS are considered. DOD concurred with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-209T": "Why GAO Did This Study The SPR stores oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas. The SPR is managed by DOE, which has a target capacity of 500 million barrels. The SPR is expected to hold between 506 and 513 million barrels of oil by 2025. The SPR is also a component of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) regional refined product reserves. GAO was asked to review the SPR. This statement addresses (1) how DOE has used the SPR to address domestic petroleum supply disruptions, (2) the extent to which the SPR is able to respond to domestic disruptions, and (3) the extent to which other IEA member countries structure their reserves differently. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on the SPR and DOE's use of the SPR. GAO reviewed DOE and EIA documents and interviewed DOE officials. What GAO Found The Department of Energy (DOE) has primarily used exchanges from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to private companies to address domestic petroleum supply disruptions. DOE has released oil 24 times from 1985 through September 2017, including 11 releases in response to domestic supply disruptions. Of these 11 releases, 10 were exchanges, including 6 exchanges in response to hurricanes. Of these 11 releases, 10 were exchanges, including 6 exchanges in response to hurricanes. GAO's preliminary analysis of DOE documents and reports also showed that although almost all of DOE's releases in response to domestic supply disruptions have been from the SPR, DOE also used the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve in response to Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The SPR is limited in its ability to respond to domestic petroleum supply disruptions for three main reasons. First, as GAO reported in September 2014, reserves are almost entirely composed of oil and not refined products, which may not be effective in responding to all disruptions that affect the refining sector. Second, as GAO reported in September 2014, reserves are nearly entirely located in one region, the Gulf Coast, which may limit responsiveness to disruptions in other regions. Third, during the course of GAO's ongoing work, GAO reviewed DOE and energy task force reports that found that the statutory authorities governing SPR releases may inhibit their use for regional disruptions. GAO's preliminary observations indicate that DOE has used the SPR in response to domestic supply disruptions, but the effectiveness of these releases is unclear because DOE has not formally assessed all of them. DOE has exchanged about 28 million barrels of oil in response to hurricanes, but GAO found only two reports assessing DOE's response to Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Katrina, and Rita, and it is unclear whether DOE has examined other responses. GAO's preliminary observations indicate that other IEA member countries structure their reserves differently, with some holding industry reserves and refined products, and DOE has taken steps to explore these structures. For example, most IEA members hold some amount of refined petroleum products, and some IEA member countries geographically disperse their reserves of refined petroleum products to be able to respond to domestic disruptions. However, DOE has not formally evaluated other countries' structures in over 35 years and has not finalized its 2015 studies on regional petroleum product reserves. GAO's preliminary review indicates that DOE examined the feasibility of additional regional petroleum product reserves in two 2015 studies, but it did not finalize these studies or expand the SPR to include additional reserves. In September 2014, GAO reported that DOE officials told GAO they were conducting a regional fuel resiliency study that would provide insights into whether there is a need for additional regional product reserves and, if so, where these reserves should be located. The Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015 recommended that DOE analyze the need for additional or expanded regional product reserves by undertaking updated cost-benefit analyses for all of the regions of the United States that have been identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement.",
    "gao_GAO-18-700T": "Why GAO Did This Study EPA has not issued legally enforceable standards for PFAS in drinking water. DOD has taken actions to address PFOS and PFOA contamination at or near its military installations. GAO was asked to review DOD's actions to address PFOS and PFOA contamination. This statement addresses (1) actions DOD has taken to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water and concerns with firefighting foam, and (2) steps DOD has taken to address health and environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report on PFOS and PFOA and a March 2018 report to Congress on DOD's response to PFOS and PFOA contamination. GAO reviewed DOD's actions to address PFOS and PFOA contamination at or near military installations and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has initiated actions to address elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water and concerns with firefighting foam. GAO reported in October 2017 that, following the release of EPA's lifetime health advisory for PFAS in May 2016, each of the military departments directed their installations to identify locations with any known or suspected prior release of PFOS and PFOA and to address any releases that pose a risk to human health\u2014which can include people living outside DOD installations; and test for PFOS and PFOA in their drinking water and address any contamination above EPA's lifetime health advisory level. GAO further reported that, as of December 2016, DOD had identified 393 active or closed military installations with any known or suspected releases of PFOS or PFOA. Since GAO issued its report, DOD has updated that number to 401 active or closed installations, according to August 2017 data provided in a March 2018 report to Congress on the department's response to PFOS and PFOA contamination. DOD's March 2018 report to Congress provided updated information on actions taken (such as providing alternative drinking water or installing treatment systems) to address PFOS and PFOA in drinking water at or near military installations in the United States. Specifically, DOD reported taking action as of August 2017 to address PFOS and PFOA levels exceeding those recommended in EPA's health advisories for drinking water for people (1) on 13 military installations and (2) outside 22 military installations. GAO reported in October 2017 that, in addition to actions initiated by DOD, the department also took action in response to state and federal regulators. DOD responded to four administrative orders requiring that DOD address PFOS and PFOA levels that exceeded EPA's health advisory levels for drinking water. One order was issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, and three orders were issued by EPA at the former Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire; Horsham Air Guard Station in Pennsylvania; and the former Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster in Pennsylvania. In response to the order from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the Air Force closed drinking water wells, installed new monitoring wells, and provided bottled water to vulnerable populations on the installation. In its October 2017 report, GAO found that DOD was taking steps to address health and environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS. These steps included restricting the use of existing foams that contain PFAS, testing DOD's current foams to identify the amount of PFAS they contain, and funding research into the future development of PFAS-free foam that can meet DOD's performance and compatibility requirements. Some of these steps, such as limiting the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS, were in place. Others, such as researching potential PFAS-free firefighting foams, were in progress at the time of GAO's review. DOD's military specification for firefighting foam, which outlines performance and compatibility requirements, also requires that firefighting foam purchased by the department contain PFAS. GAO reported in October 2017 that, according to DOD, there was no PFAS-free firefighting foam that could meet DOD's performance and compatibility requirements. As a result, the Navy\u2014which is the author of the military specification\u2014had no plans to remove the requirement for firefighting foam to contain PFAS. However, Navy officials told GAO during GAO's review that if a PFAS-free foam were to be developed that could meet DOD performance and compatibility requirements the Navy would make any necessary revisions to the military specification at that time. Navy officials also said during GAO's review that they",
    "gao_GAO-18-461": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. pipeline network includes both interstate and intrastate pipelines, the vast majority of which fall into the latter category: Interstate pipelines. Interstate pipelines are primarily large-volume transmission pipelines that carry gas or hazardous liquids to communities and large-volume users (e.g., factories). PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for domestic interstate and intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. PHMSA may permit certified states to participate in interstate pipeline inspections through three types of agreements. GAO was asked to review PHMSA's interstate pipeline inspection activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which state pipeline safety agencies participate in interstate pipeline inspections, and (2) how PHMSA allocates its inspection resources. GAO reviewed PHMSA's interstate pipeline inspection plans and interviewed PHMSA officials. GAO also interviewed state pipeline safety officials in six states that have applied for interstate agent status. What GAO Found Interstate pipeline safety agencies conduct high-quality inspections of interstate pipelines and provide an important supplement to the federal inspection workforce. PHMSA regional officials GAO met with generally agreed that interstate agents have well-trained staff and leverage their local knowledge to enhance interstate pipeline inspections within their state. Additionally, interstate agents, if authorized by PHMSA, may conduct inspections of interstate pipelines within their state more frequently than PHMSA. For instance, in one PHMSA region, PHMSA officials said that an interstate agent in their jurisdiction ensured each interstate operator was inspected once every 2 years, regardless of PHMSA's risk ranking. Similarly, in two of five regions that have interstate agents, PHMSA regional officials stated that they needed interstate agents to supplement their current allocation of federal inspectors. PHMSA officials said that, although the region could absorb the interstate agent workload if needed, doing so would lead to less extensive inspections because there would more pipelines to inspect with fewer federal inspectors. Interstate agents may also enhance pipeline safety oversight within their state by going above and beyond the annual interstate inspection activities required under their agreement with PHMSA. Specifically, as part of the annual inspection planning process, PHMSA's regional offices work with interstate agents to develop an annual inspection plan. While interstate agents must prioritize PHMSA's inspection priorities, such as participation in new construction inspections and PHMSA-led systems inspections, they can also propose additional inspections of interstate pipelines within their state. Officials in half of the nine states with interstate agent agreements stated that they proposed and obtained PHMSA's approval for additional interstate pipeline inspections that would not otherwise have been included in PHMSA's annual inspection plan. PHMSA officials stated that they do not intend to discontinue current interstate agent agreements, but due in part to a recent staff increase the agency has sufficient staff to meet its inspection needs without adding additional interstate agents. PHMSA officials also told GAO that intrastate pipelines pose the highest safety risk to states and, consequently, state pipeline safety agencies should focus their efforts on intrastate pipeline oversight rather than participating in interstate pipeline inspections. PHMSA's other means of state participation in interstate pipeline inspections have not been used extensively. For example, PHMSA's other means of state participation in interstate pipeline inspections have not been used extensively. For example, PHMSA's other means of state participation in interstate pipeline inspections have not been used extensively. For example, PHMSA's other means of state participation in interstate pipeline inspections have not been used extensively. From fiscal year 2012 to 2017, PHMSA's funding increased by nearly 40 percent, allowing the agency to hire additional pipeline inspectors. Specifically, PHMSA's funding increased from $110 million in fiscal year 2012 to $154 million in fiscal year 2017. PHMSA's inspection and enforcement division received the majority of the increased funding, allowing that division to hire additional staff. From fiscal year 2012 through 2017, the number of inspectors hired increased by over 25 percent, from 107 to 147 across the five PHMSA regions. PHMSA officials said the regional workload analysis has resulted in a better match between workforce staffing and needs. However, PHMSA has not developed a workforce plan for interstate pipeline inspections that systematically identifies the anticipated interstate pipeline inspection workload or the number of inspection staff needed to meet that workload. In light of the diminishing role that interstate agents currently provide in bolstering PHMSA's inspection workforce, a plan for conducting future interstate pipeline inspections should also account for the reduction in resources and expertise state inspectors can potentially provide.

The Bank is required to have a \"reasonable assurance\" of repayment when providing financing; it must supplement, and not compete with, private capital; and it must provide terms that are competitive with foreign export credit agencies. The Bank has taken some steps to address fraud that are among leading practices identified in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. GAO was asked to review the Bank's fraud risk management. This report examines the extent to which the Bank has (1) established an organizational culture and structure conducive to planned regular fraud risk assessments and assessed risks to determine a fraud risk profile; (2) designed and implemented a strategy with specific control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks; and (3) evaluated outcomes using a risk-based approach and adapted activities to improve fraud risk management. GAO surveyed all employees of the Bank, and analyzed survey data. GAO also interviewed Bank managers and staff. What GAO Found The Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Bank) has identified a dedicated entity to lead fraud risk management activities, as called for in the first component of GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. In addition, employees generally have a positive view of antifraud efforts across the Bank, according to GAO's employee survey. However, GAO also found that management and staff have differing views on key aspects of the Bank's antifraud culture. For example, GAO found that while the Bank has a clear antifraud tone, it has not established a shared view on key aspects of that culture. The Bank has taken some steps to assess fraud risk, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment, tailored to its operations, or created a fraud risk profile, both as provided in the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO also found that the Bank has not yet completed a fraud risk assessment tailored to its operations. Consequently, the Bank cannot develop an antifraud strategy and associated controls that meet the leading practice until it has completed a fraud risk assessment and documented the results in a fraud risk profile. Until the Bank has completed a fraud risk assessment and corresponding fraud risk profile, and has designed and implemented specific control activities to prevent and detect fraud, it is at risk of failing to address fraud vulnerabilities that could hurt its performance, undermine its reputation, or impair its ability to fulfill its mission. The Bank has taken some steps to share information on fraud risks across the institution, through a variety of mechanisms, but it has opportunities to further improve information sharing to build fraud awareness and use of data analytics. For example, the Bank has taken some steps to share information on fraud risks across the institution, through a variety of mechanisms, but it has opportunities to further improve information sharing to build fraud awareness and use of data analytics.

For example, the Bank has taken some steps to share information on fraud cases, but it does not maintain and share such information with staff. Until the Bank has a feasible and cost-effective means of linking fraud cases to specific transactions, its ability to use data-analytics for antifraud purposes will be limited. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Bank (1) evaluate and implement methods to further promote and sustain an antifraud tone that permeates the organizational culture, (2) develop and implement an antifraud strategy with specific control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks, and (3) evaluate outcomes using a risk-based approach and adapted activities to improve fraud risk management.

    "gao_GAO-18-432T": "Why GAO Did This Study SSA administers three key programs that provide financial benefits to eligible individuals. SSA also provides disability insurance, disability insurance, and Supplemental Security Income. SSA's mission is to provide financial benefits to eligible individuals through three benefit programs: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance (DI), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In support of its mission, SSA maintains workers' earnings information and in fiscal year 2017 posted over 279 million earnings items to workers' records. SSA also determines if claimants are eligible for benefits, completing 10 million claims and more than 680,000 hearings decisions in fiscal year 2017. This statement addresses (1) challenges SSA faces in managing its disability workloads and ensuring program integrity, (2) challenges to modernizing its physical footprint and service delivery, and (3) challenges to modernizing its information technology (IT). This statement is based on GAO's 2017 High Risk Update and selected updates conducted from March 2017 through February 2018. GAO's 2017 work focused on SSA's disability workloads, disability decisions, and fraud risks. GAO also reviewed SSA's plans to reconfigure its physical footprint and expand how it delivers services. What GAO Found Complex eligibility rules and multiple handoffs and potential layers of review make the Social Security Administration's (SSA) disability programs complicated and costly to administer. Program complexity arguably has made it challenging for SSA to make significant advances in efficiently managing high disability workloads, ensuring timely and consistent disability decisions, preventing benefit overpayments, and mitigating fraud risks. GAO's recent work highlighted some of the challenges SSA faces in making disability decisions that are timely, consistent and based on current concepts of disability, while also preventing and deterring fraud and ensuring that only beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits receive them. These findings underscore the need for SSA leadership to approach these challenges strategically and follow through with rigorous plans in order to achieve significant improvements in its disability programs.

The Marine Corps has used virtual training devices to train Marines in a variety of ways, including conducting sea-based operations and conducting amphibious operations from a ship. GAO was asked to review the Marine Corps' efforts to integrate its forces into amphibious operations. This report examines the extent to which (1) the Navy and Marine Corps have completed training for amphibious operations priorities and taken steps to mitigate any training shortfalls, (2) the Navy's and Marine Corps' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations incorporate leading collaborative practices, and (3) the Marine Corps has integrated selected virtual training devices into its operational training. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from the services, including the Marine Corps, and the services' headquarters and headquarters. GAO also visited three Marine Corps installations selected based on geographic dispersion and training needs. What GAO Found The Navy and Marine Corps units that are deploying as part of an Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) completed their required training for amphibious operations, but several factors have limited the ability of Marine Corps units to conduct training for other amphibious operations-related priorities. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken steps to identify and address amphibious training shortfalls, but their efforts to mitigate these shortfalls have not prioritized available training resources, systematically evaluated among potential training resource alternatives to accomplish the services' amphibious operations training priorities, or monitored progress toward achieving the priorities. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services, but the services have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices that would help drive efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations. GAO's prior work on interagency collaboration has found that certain practices can help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies. For example, the services have not defined and articulate common outcomes for naval integration, such as defining and articulating common outcomes for naval integration. The services have not fully established compatible policies and procedures, such as common training tasks and standards and agreed-upon roles and responsibilities, to ensure their efforts to achieve improved naval integration are consistent and sustained. The Marine Corps has taken some steps to integrate virtual training devices into its operational training, but the Marine Corps' process to manage the development and use of its virtual training devices in operational training plans has gaps. For example, the Marine Corps does not (1) include consideration of critical factors for integrating virtual training devices into operational training in its front-end planning to support the acquisition of its virtual training devices, (2) consistently consider expected and actual usage data for virtual training devices to support its investment decisions, or (3) consistently evaluate the effectiveness of its virtual training devices for operational training. The Marine Corps' process to manage the development and use of virtual training devices in operational training plans has gaps due to a lack of guidance. Specifically, the Marine Corps does not (1) include consideration of critical factors for integrating virtual training devices into operational training in its front-end planning to support the acquisition of its virtual training devices, (2) consistently consider expected and actual usage data for virtual training devices to support its investment decisions, or (3) consistently evaluate the effectiveness of its virtual training devices for operational training. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Navy and Marine Corps (1) develop an approach to prioritize available training resources, systematically evaluate among training resource alternatives to achieve amphibious operations priorities, and monitor progress toward achieving them; (2) define and articulate common outcomes for naval integration; (3) more fully establish compatible policies, procedures, and systems; (4) better leverage training resources; and (5) establish mechanisms to monitor results.

    "gao_GAO-19-60": "Why GAO Did This Study The Secret Service is responsible for protecting the nation's financial and information systems. The Secret Service has faced long-standing challenges in managing its IT infrastructure. In 2009, the Secret Service initiated the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment, which is intended to modernize and enhance the component's infrastructure, communications systems, applications, and processes. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's IT portfolio. This report examines the extent to which (1) the Secret Service has implemented selected IT oversight responsibilities, (2) the Secret Service has implemented leading workforce planning and management practices for its IT workforce, and (3) the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have implemented selected performance and progress monitoring practices for the IITT investment. GAO analyzed DHS policies and guidance, and interviewed DHS and Secret Service officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) Chief Information Officer (CIO) fully implemented 11 of 14 selected responsibilities established for component-level CIOs in DHS's IT management policies. The Secret Service CIO fully implemented 11 of the 14 selected responsibilities. For example, the CIO developed an IT strategic plan that outlined the CIO's strategic IT goals and objectives, as well as tasks intended to meet the goals and objectives. The CIO also took steps to implement the tasks identified within the strategic plan, such as working to develop an IT training program. In addition, the CIO had partially implemented three component-level CIO responsibilities. For example, the CIO had managed the component's IT investment portfolio, including establishing a component-level IT acquisition review process that enables component and DHS review of component acquisitions (i.e., contracts) that contain IT. However, the Secret Service's enterprise governance policy did not specify this as the CIO's responsibility. Further compounding the issue of the Secret Service's enterprise governance policy not properly reflecting the CIO's and Deputy CIO's roles and responsibilities on the component's governance boards is that the Secret Service has not developed a charter for its Executive Resources Board. Until the Secret Service updates its enterprise governance policy to specify (1) the CIO's current role and responsibilities on the Executive Resources Board, to include developing and reviewing the IT budget formulation and execution; and (2) the Deputy CIO's role and responsibilities on the Enterprise Governance Council, the CIO's ability to develop and review the component's IT budget may be limited. Further, the Secret Service has not fully implemented the majority of the 15 selected leading planning and management practices for its IT workforce. Of the five selected workforce planning and management areas, the Secret Service had substantially implemented two of the areas and minimally implemented three of the areas for its IT workforce. In addition, of the 15 selected leading practices associated with these areas, the Secret Service had fully implemented 3 practices, partly implemented 8 practices, and did not implement any aspects of 4 practices. Until the Secret Service updates its recruiting and hiring strategies and plans to address all IT competency and staffing gaps identified (after OCIO completes its analysis of the entire IT workforce), the Secret Service will be limited in its ability to effectively recruit and hire staff to fill those gaps. The Secret Service substantially implemented three practices associated with the IT workforce, partly implemented 8 practices, and did not implement any aspects of 4 practices.

    "gao_GAO-18-240": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is an important source of funds for GME training, and through its funding and workforce planning efforts, HHS, as the largest funder of GME training, has an important role in ensuring federal programs are meeting the nation's workforce needs. GAO was asked to review federal funding of GME training. This report examines (1) the amount spent on GME training in 2015, and the amount spent per full-time-equivalent (FTE) resident; (2) the extent to which federal agencies collect information about how federal funding is used to support GME training; and (3) the extent to which HHS collects information about how federal funding is used to support GME training. GAO analyzed federal and state data on GME training spending, reviewed literature and experts, and interviewed federal and state officials and experts from research and industry organizations. What GAO Found Federal agencies and state Medicaid agencies spent over $16.3 billion on graduate medical education (GME) training in 2015, and the amount spent per FTE resident varied across programs. The amount spent per FTE resident varied across programs, and the largest variation across payment recipients and regions was within Medicare due to variation in the values of factors used to calculate Medicare payment amounts. Almost half of participants received payments from more than one program, and the designs of federal programs may reduce the potential for duplicate payments. GME training costs vary by program characteristics, such as size, type, training setting, and age, and some training costs are more prone to variation than others. Challenges exist in measuring and comparing GME training costs due to a lack of standard cost methodologies across teaching sites and some training costs being difficult to measure. Further, little is known about how GME training costs relate to federal GME funding. Agencies generally collect information to manage their respective programs, ensure the accuracy of payments, and reduce the potential for duplicative payments within or across federal programs that fund GME training. However, HHS does not have sufficient information available to comprehensively evaluate the federal programs that fund GME training, identify gaps between federal GME programs' results and physician workforce needs, and make or recommend to Congress changes in order to improve the efficient and effective use of federal funds. For example, HHS does not collect information about the total number and specialty type of residents supported by all of the federal programs that fund GME training. As a result, HHS cannot identify problems and make or recommend changes to Congress in order to improve the efficient and effective use of federal funds. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HHS coordinate with federal agencies, including VA, that fund GME training to identify information needed to evaluate the performance of federal programs that fund GME training, including the extent to which these programs are efficient and cost-effective and are meeting the nation's health care workforce needs. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-291": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid is the nation's largest health care program, with about $1.3 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2017. The Medicaid program is the largest federal program in the United States, with about $1.3 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2017. CMS estimates the national Medicaid improper payment rate through the PERM, which measures the accuracy of the capitated payments state Medicaid agencies make to MCOs. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of Medicaid managed care. This report examines (1) the extent to which CMS's payment error rate measures the accuracy of Medicaid managed care payments, (2) the extent to which CMS and states ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable MCO costs, and (3) the extent to which CMS and states ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable MCO costs. GAO reviewed the PERM and 27 federal and state audits and investigations of Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO) and providers. GAO also interviewed CMS officials and state auditors. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) payment error rate measurement for Medicaid managed care does not account for overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. The PERM does not account for overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. Among the 27 audits and investigations of Medicaid managed care programs GAO reviewed, 10 identified about $68 million in MCO overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for in PERM estimates. In addition, one investigation of an MCO operating in nine states resulted in a $137.5 million settlement to resolve allegations of false claims. However, the full extent of these overpayments and unallowable MCO costs is unknown, because these audits and investigations were conducted over more than 5 years and involved a small fraction of the more than 270 MCOs operating nationwide as of September 2017. Specifically, 24 of the audits and investigations represented reviews in 10 states and, in many cases, focused on individual providers or MCOs; there were about 90 MCOs operating in the 10 states as of September 2017. Among the 27 audits and investigations, 10 identified about $68 million in MCO overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs that were not accounted for in PERM estimates.

Specifically, 24 of the audits and investigations represented reviews in 10 states and, in many cases, focused on individual providers or MCOs; there were about 90 MCOs operating in the 10 states as of September 2017. Unless removed from these cost data, unidentified overpayments and unallowable MCO costs would likely inflate the MCO cost data that states use to set capitation rates. As a result, future capitation rates would also be inflated, resulting in higher state and federal spending. CMS and state oversight of Medicaid managed care do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments and unallowable MCO costs. CMS has taken some steps to strengthen oversight of managed care programs through updated regulations; reviews of states' managed care programs (Focused Program Integrity Reviews) and collaborative audits, which are conducted jointly by federal program integrity contractors and states; and state monitoring of overpayments. However, these efforts fall short of mitigating the limitations of the PERM estimates of improper payments for managed care, because they do not ensure the identification and reporting of overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs.

    "gao_GAO-18-539": "Why GAO Did This Study The growth of shared mobility services\u2014such as mobile applications that allow riders to request a ride or a ride-sharing service\u2014has increased the use of public transit. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for funding and expanding public transportation systems. Local transit agencies nationwide are pursuing partnerships to offer a variety of on-demand services that aim to make access to public transportation more efficient and convenient. GAO was asked to review partnerships. This report examines (1) how local transit agencies are pursuing partnerships, (2) the extent to which these partnerships are meeting federal requirements, and (3) the factors that could affect the future prevalence of such partnerships. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed DOT officials; and analyzed data from FTA and private mobility companies. What GAO Found Local transit agencies nationwide are pursuing partnerships to offer a variety of on-demand services that aim to make access to public transportation more efficient and convenient. The private mobility companies involved in selected partnerships include some well-known companies such as Uber and Lyft, and some lesser-known types of companies such as a bike-share company and technology companies focused on transportation. Selected local transit agencies most frequently partnered with ridesourcing companies (11 projects), while 8 partnership projects included more than one type of private partner. Five of the 22 partnership projects were in FTA's MOD Sandbox program. Most of the selected projects (14 of 22) involved on-demand first- and last-mile transportation connections, through which respective local transit agencies aim to increase ridership on their transit systems. Addressing the first- and last-mile issue has been identified as an ongoing challenge for many local transit agencies seeking to increase their transit ridership. Research suggests that the easier it is to access a transit system, the more likely people are to use it. Connecting on-demand services for the \u201cfirst- and last-mile\u201d\u2014which refers to the distances riders need to travel to or from a public transit station or a stop to arrive at their final destination\u2014could improve transit access by effectively extending service beyond the respective fixed-route buses and commuter trains. To attract riders to use such first- and last-mile services, eight projects provided a discount to pay for a portion of the fare for the ridesourcing ride to access public transit. The second most common type of service provided through selected projects was on-demand paratransit service, which could help the respective transit agencies offer eligible riders more convenient options and also help address the high cost of providing such services. Most of the selected projects (13 of 22) provided on-demand services targeted toward paratransit-eligible riders, either as the primary project goal or to ensure equivalent service for eligible customers. Most of the selected projects (14 of 22) provided on-demand services targeted toward paratransit-eligible riders, either as the primary project goal or to ensure equivalent service for eligible customers. Most of the selected projects (13 of 22) provided on-demand services targeted toward paratransit-eligible riders, either as the primary project goal or to ensure equivalent service for eligible customers. Most of the selected projects (14 of 22) have not yet been evaluated to determine whether they achieved intended outcomes. However, a few transit officials told GAO that their agencies' costs had decreased since initiating the partnerships. For example, an official from one transit agency reported that the on-demand service provided through their partnership had helped them reduce costs for paratransit. Two of the completed partnerships in GAO's review generated insufficient ridership to succeed. The partnerships were widely covered by the press, which transit agency officials believe provides other transit agencies the opportunity to learn from them as well. FTA has facilitated partnerships through the MOD program, which is a key effort under way to encourage and better understand transit partnerships. FTA has provided technical support to participants as the MOD Sandbox projects have progressed, and most (10 of 16) selected local transit agencies in GAO's review expressed positive views on the program. FTA has also gathered information from grantees about federal requirements that may pose challenges to implementing partnerships. For example, FTA has issued documentation clarifying various aspects of transit partnerships, as well as certain federal requirements. FTA officials said that they have sought to clarify how some of these requirements apply to emerging partnerships. However, officials from most (14 of 16) selected local transit agencies told GAO that additional information from FTA would be helpful, especially examples of how local transit agencies are structuring their partnerships to ensure they meet federal requirements. FTA officials said that they are considering issuing more information clarifying required NTD reporting for on-demand services provided through partnerships. However, FTA officials told GAO that they do not track information about partnerships that did not receive funding through the MOD Sandbox program, such",
    "gao_GAO-19-144": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government and private industry face a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT professionals to implement and oversee information security protections to combat cyber threats. The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 required OPM, NIST, and other federal agencies to undertake a number of cybersecurity workforce-planning activities. The act also required GAO to report on the status of these activities. This report (1) determines the extent to which federal agencies have assigned work role codes to positions performing information technology (IT), cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions, and (2) describes the steps federal agencies took to identify work roles of critical need. GAO reviewed the act and OPM guidance and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed a random sample of 2210 IT management positions from six agencies selected based on their total cybersecurity spending for fiscal year 2016. What GAO Found The 24 major departments and agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (the act) generally assigned work role codes to their positions. However, several agencies had not completed assigning codes to their vacant positions. In addition, most agencies had likely miscategorized the work roles of many positions. For example, in these instances, the agencies had assigned a code designated for positions that do not perform IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions to positions that most likely perform these functions. The 24 agencies had taken steps to address the three selected activities required by the act. Specifically, OPM reported on agencies' progress in identifying critical needs and provided agencies with guidance for identifying IT, cybersecurity, and cyber-related work roles of critical need. In addition, the 24 agencies had submitted preliminary reports of their identified critical needs to OPM, but their efforts to identify critical needs were ongoing. The act required OPM to identify critical needs across federal agencies and submit a progress report to Congress on the identification of IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related work roles of critical need by December 2017. The act also required OPM to provide timely guidance for identifying IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related work roles of critical need, including current acute and emerging skill shortages. In addition, the 24 agencies had begun to identify critical needs and submitted a preliminary report of their identified critical needs to OPM. Most agencies' reports included the required critical needs and root causes. Specifically, Twenty-four agencies' reports documented work roles of critical need. Twenty-two agencies' reports included the root cause of the critical needs identified. What GAO Recommends GAO is making 28 recommendations to 22 agencies to complete the appropriate assignment of codes to their positions performing IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions, in accordance with the requirements of the act. Of the 22 agencies to which GAO made recommendations, 20 agencies stated that they agreed with the recommendations directed to them; one agency partially agreed with the recommendation; and one agency agreed with one recommendation but did not agree with one recommendation. In addition, of the two agencies to which GAO did not make recommendations, one agency acknowledged its review of the report but did not otherwise provide comments; the other agency provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated into the report as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-417": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on its workforce to conduct research, development, and engineering. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the defense laboratories' hiring efforts. This report examines (1) the defense laboratories' use of existing hiring authorities and what officials view as the benefits of authorities and incentives and the challenges in hiring; (2) the extent to which the department evaluates the effectiveness of hiring, including hiring authorities, at the defense laboratories; and (3) the extent to which DOD has time frames for approving and implementing new hiring authorities. GAO analyzed DOD hiring data for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 and interviewed officials from the defense laboratories. GAO also surveyed 16 laboratory officials on their perceptions of the various hiring authorities and incentives, and interviewed hiring officials and supervisors from the labs. What GAO Found The defense laboratories have used the defense laboratory-specific direct hire authorities more than any other category of hiring authorities when hiring science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel. Moreover, the use of these direct hire authorities increased each year from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2017. Of the 11,562 STEM hiring actions in fiscal years 2015 through 2017, approximately 46 percent were completed using one of the defense laboratory direct hire authorities. The second and third most used hiring authorities were internal hiring actions and the expedited hiring authority for acquisition personnel, each of which comprised approximately 12 percent of the hiring actions during the time period. The three defense laboratory-specific direct hire authorities were the most helpful to the labs' efforts to hire highly qualified candidates for STEM positions, and also reported that the use of certain incentives had been helpful in this effort. However, even with access to the authorities, these defense laboratory officials identified challenges associated with the hiring process that affected their ability to hire highly qualified candidates. The department and the defense laboratories track hiring data that can be used to evaluate some aspects of the individual labs' hiring efforts, but the Defense Laboratories Office has not routinely obtained or monitored these data or evaluated the effectiveness of hiring, including the use of hiring authorities, across the defense laboratories as a whole. Laboratory hiring data are captured at the department level in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS)\u2014the department's system of record for personnel data. In addition, the individual defense laboratories track hiring data, including the type of hiring authority used and certain milestone dates that can be used to measure the length of the hiring process, known as time to hire. According to Office of Personnel Management guidance and GAO's prior work, time to hire is a measure that may inform about the effectiveness of the hiring process, and federal agencies are required to report time to hire for certain types of hiring actions to OPM. Without routinely obtaining and monitoring defense laboratory hiring data and developing performance measures, the Defense Laboratories Office cannot effectively oversee the effectiveness of hiring, including the use of hiring authorities, at the defense laboratories. Specifically, without performance measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the defense laboratories' hiring, and more specifically the use of hiring authorities, the department lacks reasonable assurance that these authorities\u2014in particular, those granted by Congress to the defense laboratories\u2014are resulting in improved hiring outcomes. Without evaluating the effectiveness of the defense laboratories' hiring efforts, the department cannot understand any challenges experienced by the labs or determine appropriate strategies for mitigating these challenges. As a result, the department and defense laboratories may be unable to demonstrate that they are using their authorities and flexibilities effectively, or that such authorities and flexibilities should be maintained or expanded for future use. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense (1) routinely obtain and monitor defense laboratory hiring data to improve the oversight of the defense laboratories' use of hiring authorities; (2) develop performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the defense laboratories' hiring, including the use of hiring authorities, as part of the labs' overall hiring to better inform future decision making about hiring efforts and policies; and (3) establish and document time frames for its process for departmental coordination efforts related to the approval and implementation of new hiring authorities.

In replacing these components, NNSA seeks approaches that will increase safety, improve security, and address defects in the warhead. In January 2017, while the program was still suspended, NNSA issued a supplemental directive that defines additional activities that NNSA offices should conduct in support of the Phase 6.X process. GAO was asked to review the status of the W78 replacement program. This report examines (1) the steps NNSA has taken to prepare to restart a program to replace the W78 nuclear warhead capability and (2) the extent to which NNSA has identified the facilities and capabilities at the laboratories and production sites that will be needed to provide the nuclear and nonnuclear components for a W78 replacement. GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed NNSA officials. GAO also interviewed contractors and NNSA officials. What GAO Found NNSA has taken steps to prepare to restart a program to replace the W78 nuclear warhead capability. According to NNSA officials, these steps are typically needed to conduct any life extension program (LEP). Therefore, they can be undertaken despite the uncertainty about whether the final program will develop the warhead for the Air Force only or for both the Air Force and the Navy. Specifically, NNSA has (1) taken initial steps to establish the program management functions needed to execute the program and assemble personnel for a program management team; (2) assessed technologies that have been under development while the program was suspended that could potentially be used to support a W78 replacement; and (3) initiated plans for the facilities and capabilities needed to provide the nuclear and nonnuclear components for the warhead. At the time of GAO's review, NNSA and DOD officials stated that, in response to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, they planned to restart a program that would focus on replacing the capabilities of the W78 for the Air Force; however, the extent to which the program would focus on providing a nuclear explosive package for the Navy was uncertain. DOD officials said that the Navy plans to complete a study examining the feasibility of using the nuclear explosive package developed for the W78 replacement warhead in its SLBM system by the end of fiscal year 2019. According to DOD officials, the Nuclear Weapons Council will make a decision about developing an interoperable warhead for the Air Force and the Navy based on the results of the study but, as of August 2018, had not established time frames for making that decision. According to Air Force and NNSA officials, if the Nuclear Weapons Council decided that the Navy should participate in the program, then NNSA would not need to redo the work planned for fiscal year 2019. NNSA has taken initial steps to establish the program management functions needed to execute the program and assemble personnel for a program management team. For example, NNSA assigned a manager for a W78 replacement program who is taking or plans to take steps to implement these functions. In addition, as of July 2018, NNSA had created a preliminary schedule for a W78 replacement program under the Phase 6.X process. According to NNSA's preliminary schedule, the program will restart in Phase 6.2 (Feasibility and Design Options) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. NNSA previously completed Phase 6.1 and was authorized by the Nuclear Weapons Council to start Phase 6.2 in June 2012. During Phase 6.2, NNSA plans to, among other things, select design options and develop cost estimates of the selected design options. Conduct Phase 6.2A (Design Definition and Cost Study) for one year beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. During this phase, NNSA plans to develop a preliminary cost estimate for the program, called a weapons design and cost report, and also produce an independent cost estimate. Start Phase 6.3 (Development Engineering) in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 and transition to Phase 6.4 (Production Engineering) in the mid-2020s. During these phases, NNSA will develop the final design as well as begin producing selected acquisition reports, which detail the total program cost, schedule, and performance, among other things. NNSA officials said they will need to achieve sufficient program management rigor in Phase 6.3 to effectively report to Congress on the status and performance of the program as NNSA develops cost and schedule baselines. NNSA has also taken initial steps to develop technologies that could potentially be used by the W78 replacement program and potentially by other future life extension programs. For example, NNSA supported the development of technologies through ongoing LEPs (",
    "gao_GAO-18-290": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government invests billions of dollars annually in STEM education programs to enhance the nation's economic and educational competitiveness. The federal government has a portfolio of programs that provide similar services to similar groups in similar STEM fields. GAO previously reported that most federal STEM education programs overlapped to some degree with at least one other program, in that they offered similar services to similar groups in similar STEM fields to achieve similar objectives. GAO was asked to review the extent to which federal STEM education programs have evolved since 2010, and the extent to which the federal portfolio has been able to serve similar populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields. This report examines (1) the number of STEM education programs and their spending in fiscal year 2016, (2) the extent to which STEM education programs overlapped with at least one other program, and (3) the extent to which the Committee on STEM Education and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have fulfilled their responsibilities to assess the portfolio. GAO analyzed agency documents and data, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also surveyed 198 federal STEM education programs. What GAO Found From 2010 to 2016, the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs decreased while spending remained stable. Three agencies\u2014the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Science Foundation\u2014administered more than half of all STEM education programs in fiscal years 2010 and 2016. Despite collectively reporting fewer STEM education programs, program officials responding to GAO's questionnaire reported spending about the same amount in fiscal year 2016 as they did in fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2016, program officials reported spending about $2.9 billion on the 163 programs. Spending by individual programs ranged from about $14,000 annually to hundreds of millions of dollars. The National Science Foundation and the Department of Health and Human Services programs account for about 60 percent of this spending. The Committee on STEM Education and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have not fully fulfilled their responsibilities to assess the federal portfolio of STEM education programs. Specifically, the Committee on STEM Education has not reviewed performance assessments of STEM education programs to ensure effectiveness\u2014a primary function of its authorizing charter. Overall, the Committee made limited progress advancing its strategic goal of increasing the use of evidence-based approaches because, according to Committee leadership, they focused on achieving other strategic goals. By reviewing programs' performance assessments, the Committee could leverage existing performance information to identify and share promising practices that agencies could use in designing or revising their programs. Moreover, in doing so, the Committee could further its strategic goal of increasing the use of evidence-based approaches across the portfolio of STEM education programs. The Committee has not reported STEM education programs' participation rates of groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, although broadening participation of those groups is one of the Committee's strategic goals. Moreover, the COMPETES Act requires that the Committee report the participation rates of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons from rural areas in its inventory of federal programs. Committee leadership acknowledged they have not reported these data, and added that such participation data are not fully available across all STEM education programs. However, such participation data were generally available. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the leadership of the Committee on STEM Education review performance assessments of federal STEM education programs and then take appropriate steps to enhance effectiveness of the portfolio, such as by sharing promising practices that agencies could use in designing or revising their programs. The Committee agreed with all four of GAO's recommendations and noted initial strategies for how they would implement three of them. Regarding implementation of the fourth recommendation to report on participation rates of underrepresented groups in federal STEM education programs, they noted plans to examine confounding factors inhibiting the reporting of the information required under the COMPETES Act. Gaining insight on the challenges agencies face collecting this information is an important first step. However, to comply with the requirement of the COMPETES Act and help ensure programs reach populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields, GAO continues to believe that the Committee should report the participation rates of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons from rural areas in federal STEM education programs that collect this information. To do so, the Committee may also need to develop strategies to help agencies overcome some of these confounding factors.",
    "gao_GAO-19-57": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies own billions of dollars in real property assets, including buildings, warehouses, and roads. Effective asset management can help agencies optimize limited funding and make decisions to better target their policy goals and objectives. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to manage their real property assets. This report examines (1) key characteristics of an effective asset management framework, and how selected federal agencies' frameworks reflect these characteristics; (2) views of selected experts and practitioners on challenges and benefits to implementing an asset management framework; and (3) whether government-wide asset management guidance and information reflect standards and key characteristics of an effective asset management framework. GAO reviewed relevant literature, analyzed federal agencies' asset management frameworks, and interviewed experts and practitioners from six selected agencies. GAO selected these agencies based on their size, replacement value, and other characteristics. GAO also interviewed experts and practitioners about their views on challenges and benefits to implementing an asset management framework. What GAO Found Effective asset management frameworks include six key characteristics: (1) establishing formal policies and plans, (2) maximizing an asset portfolio's value, (3) maintaining leadership support, (4) using quality data, (5) promoting a collaborative organizational culture, and (6) evaluating and improving asset management practices. Each of the six agencies GAO reviewed had a real property asset management framework that included some of these key characteristics. However, agencies varied in how they performed activities in these areas. For example, while some agencies' asset management policies applied to large portions of their portfolios, other agencies' policies applied to only certain portions of their portfolios. In addition, two agencies\u2014the Corps and Coast Guard\u2014told GAO they were using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 55000 standards. For example, according to Corps officials, the Corps is in the process of incorporating elements of the ISO 55000 standards into its frameworks. Coast Guard officials told GAO they were using the ISO 55000 standards as a benchmark to compare against their existing framework. Officials from the six agencies GAO reviewed said that more centralized decision-making processes can provide improved standardization and clarity in the prioritization process, particularly for high value projects, and can help ensure that mission-critical projects receive funding. Officials from the six agencies GAO reviewed said that more centralized decision-making processes can provide improved standardization and clarity in the prioritization process, particularly for high value projects, and can help ensure that mission-critical projects receive funding. Officials from the six agencies GAO reviewed said that having staff embrace asset management is a key to successful implementation, for example, Park Service officials told GAO they implemented an organizational change-management process and provided additional training to staff in key asset management areas such as data collection. Officials from five of the six agencies told GAO they are in the process of developing or implementing major changes to their asset management policies, including developing new policies for collecting data, measuring asset criticality, and prioritizing investments. Experts and practitioners GAO interviewed cited challenges to implementing an asset management framework, including organizational culture changes and capacity challenges, such as lack of skills and knowledge of management practices. Experts and practitioners GAO interviewed most often cited the ISO 55000 standards as a useful resource that provided a solid foundation for an asset management framework and could inform federal agencies' asset management efforts. For example, one expert stated that collecting more detailed and quality information about assets has allowed the organization to make better-informed decisions about how to maintain and invest in its assets. However, officials from four agencies raised some concerns about using these standards, such as concerns about upfront costs and resources needed to implement the standards and their applicability to the federal government given the size, scope, and uniqueness of agencies' assets, and the diverse missions of each agency. Officials from five of the six agencies GAO reviewed stated that they were familiar with the ISO 55000 standards, and officials from the Corps stated that they use selected practices from the ISO 55000 standards. However, officials from four agencies raised some concerns about using these standards, such as concerns about upfront costs and resources needed to implement the standards and their applicability to the federal government given the size, scope, and uniqueness of agencies' assets, and the diverse missions of each agency.

    "gao_GAO-18-606": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government provides grants to states, localities, and nonprofit organizations to help prevent and treat substance use and to recover from substance use. GAO was asked to review federal grant programs for substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal grant programs target adolescents and young adults and (2) the extent to which federal grant programs have focused on prevention, treatment, and recovery for these populations. GAO analyzed federal grant programs and interviewed officials from four federal agencies, including the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), and Education (Education). GAO also interviewed officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). HHS, DOJ, and ONDCP provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Education did not have comments on GAO's draft. What GAO Found GAO identified 12 federal grant programs within three of the four agencies in GAO's review that funded substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services in fiscal year 2017 and targeted adolescents' and young adults' use of illicit substances. Eight of these programs focused on prevention, and all 8 remain active in fiscal year 2018. The 8 grant programs have varying purposes and were administered by two entities within HHS\u2014SAMHSA or IHS\u2014or by ONDCP. For example, the Drug-Free Communities Support Program is funded and directed by ONDCP to support community coalitions in preventing and reducing substance abuse among youth aged 18 and younger. The other 7 programs had a combined total of 434 that included states and federally recognized tribes. The total number of active grantees in fiscal year 2017 includes those that received a single- or multi-year award in fiscal year 2017, as well as those that received a multi-year award in fiscal year 2016 for a project that was ongoing in fiscal year 2017. The 4 grant programs that targeted substance use treatment and recovery services had active grantees in fiscal year 2017. Two of the 4 programs ended at the close of fiscal year 2017 and the other 2 remained active in fiscal year 2018. The 4 programs had different purposes and were administered by two entities within HHS\u2014SAMHSA or IHS\u2014or by ONDCP. For example, the Drug-Free Communities Support Program is funded and directed by ONDCP to support community coalitions in preventing and reducing substance abuse among youth aged 18 and younger. The other 7 programs had a combined total of 434 that included states and federally recognized tribes. The 4 grant programs had ongoing or planned evaluations to assess the effectiveness of their grantees in accomplishing a variety of program goals, according to agency officials. GAO identified 186 active grant-funded research projects focused on illicit substance use prevention, treatment, or recovery among adolescents and young adults in October and November 2017, and most of these projects addressed substance use prevention. Specifically, 126 research projects, or about 68 percent of NIDA's ongoing research projects for this population, involved research related to preventing the use of illicit substances, such as the use of marijuana or nonmedical use of opioids and other prescription drugs. The remaining 60 projects, or about 32 percent, involved research related to treatment for or recovery from the use of illicit substances among adolescents and young adults, or a combination of categories (e.g., substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery). Among the categories of research projects, the fewest involved research exclusively about recovery (4 out of 186 projects, or about 2 percent), as shown in the table. In fiscal year 2017, NIDA and nine other entities within HHS provided grant funding for a large study\u2014the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study\u2014designed to examine the effects of substance use and other factors on development of the adolescent brain. In fiscal year 2017, NIDA and nine other entities within HHS provided grant funding for a large study\u2014the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study\u2014designed to examine the effects of substance use and other factors on development of the adolescent brain. In fiscal year 2017, 15 federal grants provided funding for this study, of which NIDA contributed $18.1 million. Stakeholders that GAO interviewed identified various gaps in services, and among the most frequently cited were a lack of available recovery services and treatment providers for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders. They also identified gaps in substance use prevention services such as a lack of prevention services tailored for certain subgroups within these ages. In general, officials from the agencies in GAO's review agreed that these gaps exist, and described actions the agencies are taking that may help address them.

    "gao_GAO-18-348": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD requires each Service to establish its own Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) for active duty servicemembers. DOD also requires each Service to provide family support services through the EFMP. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to assess the effectiveness of the EFMP. This report examines (1) the extent to which each Service has provided family support as required by DOD, and (2) the extent to which the Services monitor and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and DOD guidance and documentation; analyzed fiscal year 2016 EFMP data; and interviewed DOD, Service, and nonfederal officials. What GAO Found Key aspects of support for families with special needs vary widely across the Department of Defense's (DOD) four military services. For example, the Marine Corps specifies a minimum level of contact for families with special needs enrolled in the EFMP. The Air Force has each installation obtain a roster of families with special needs enrolled in the EFMP on a monthly basis, but it does not require family support providers to, for example, use this information to regularly contact these families. The Navy assigns one of three service levels to each family member enrolled in the EFMP. These service levels are based on the needs of each family with special needs; family support providers are responsible for assigning a \u201cservice level\u201d that directs the frequency with which the family must be contacted. The Army has no requirements for how often families with special needs should be contacted. The Services also vary as to whether they offer legal assistance to families with special needs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires DOD to identify and report annually to the congressional defense committees on gaps in services for military families with special needs and to develop plans to address these gaps. However, DOD's most recent reports to the congressional defense committees did not address the relatively few SPs being created for families with special needs, or whether the Services are providing sufficient resources to ensure an appropriate number of family support providers. Without fully identifying and addressing potential gaps in family support across these programs, some families with special needs may not get the assistance they require, particularly when they relocate. Each Service monitors EFMP assignment coordination and family support activities, but DOD lacks common performance measures and a process to fully evaluate these activities. DOD requires each Service to monitor implementation of its EFMP, including procedures for assignment coordination and family support. To comply with this requirement, each Service has developed guidance that establishes monitoring protocols and assigns oversight responsibilities. Officials from each Service told GAO they use internal data reports from each installation to monitor assignment coordination and family support. However, DOD has not yet established common performance measures to track the Services' progress in implementing its standard procedures over time or developed a process to evaluate the overall effectiveness of each Service's assignment coordination and family support procedures. Federal internal control standards emphasize the importance of assessing performance over time and evaluating the results of monitoring activities. DOD requires each Service to monitor its own family readiness programs, including procedures for assignment coordination and family support through the EFMP, but lacks a systematic process to evaluate the results of these monitoring activities. To monitor family readiness services, as required by DOD, each Service must accredit or certify its family support services, including the EFMP, using standards developed by a national accrediting body not less than once every 4 years. In addition, personnel from each Service's headquarters are required to periodically visit installations as a part of their monitoring activities for assignment coordination, among other things. The Services initially had the Council on Accreditation accredit family support services provided through their installations' EFMPs using national standards developed for military and family readiness programs, according to the officials with whom GAO spoke. However, by 2016, each Service was certifying installations' family support services using standards that meet those of a national accrediting body, Service-specific standards, and best practices. According to officials from each Service with whom GAO spoke, this occurred due to changes in the funding levels allocated to this activity. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD assess the extent to which each Service is providing sufficient resources for an appropriate number of family support providers, develop services plans for each family with special needs, and implement a systematic process for evaluating the results of monitoring activities conducted by each Service's EFMP. DOD agreed with all three recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-449": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has used the Global Train and Equip program to provide training, equipment, and small-scale military construction activities intended to build the capacity of partner nations' military forces to conduct counterterrorism operations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for GAO to conduct biennial audits of such programs. This report examines (1) the status of funding that DOD allocated for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009 through 2017; (2) the extent to which DOD addressed security assistance planning elements in project proposals in 2016 and 2017; and (3) DOD's reporting on the achievement of Global Train and Equip project objectives and any factors affecting its ability to achieve those objectives. GAO analyzed funding data, program guidelines, project proposal documents, and congressional notifications; reviewed DOD's 2016 and 2017 project proposals; and interviewed DOD and State officials. What GAO Found Of the $4.1 billion allocated for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009 through 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) has obligated approximately $3.7 billion and disbursed $2.5 billion. Of the $4.1 billion allocated for Global Train and Equip projects in 2009 through 2017, DOD has obligated approximately $3.7 billion and disbursed $2.5 billion. DOD's 2016 and 2017 proposals for Global Train and Equip projects consistently addressed only one of the four security assistance planning elements called for by DOD guidance, but agency officials reported implementing an informal process to improve coverage of these planning elements in 2018 proposals. DOD's 2016 and 2017 guidance for Global Train and Equip project proposals called for proposal packages to address (1) project objectives, (2) partner nation absorptive capacity, (3) baseline assessments of partner nation capabilities, and (4) project sustainment needs. All 72 proposal packages GAO reviewed for 2016 and 2017 included project objectives. Slightly more than 30 percent of proposal packages in 2016 and over 80 percent in 2017 included information about partner nations' absorptive capacity, compared with 19 percent in 2015. More than 90 percent of 2016 and 2017 proposal packages included baseline assessments, in contrast to 63 percent in 2015. However, less than three-quarters of proposal packages in 2016 and 2017 included complete sustainment plans, with the percentage that did so declining from 73 percent in 2016 to 68 percent in 2017. Although DOD's 2016 and 2017 guidance called for proposals to address sustainment planning, it did not provide instructions for doing so when sustainment was not anticipated. According to DOD officials, the department has hired additional staff and developed an informal quality review process to better ensure that proposal packages include all key elements but, as of February 2018, had not documented this process as written policy. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for documenting internal control activities aimed at ensuring effective use of resources and documenting in policies an organization's internal control responsibilities. Updating its guidance to include such instructions would help ensure decision makers' access to complete information on annual sustainment costs, even costs anticipated to be negligible. Moreover, although officials reported having recently developed an informal quality review process designed to ensure that proposal packages address all required planning elements, DOD has not formalized this process as written policy. Formalizing as written policy its informal process to ensure that proposals address all four required planning elements would enable DOD to provide consistent oversight of Global Train and Equip project development and ensure decision makers have access to complete information about each element. Such information would, in turn, help DOD and State decision makers ensure the efficient use of funding under the new Section 333 authority to build partner capacity. DOD reporting on the achievement of Global Train and Equip project objectives in 2016 and 2017 indicated progress in building partner capacity to combat terrorism and conduct stability operations as well as factors that affected the progress achieved. According to DOD assessment reports and supporting documents, partner nation recipient units' overall capabilities were greater after implementation of 8 of 21 Global Train and Equip projects, and some of the remaining 13 projects produced some positive results. DOD officials said that they are in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of the assessment process conducted in 2016 and 2017 and described a variety of changes they are making to improve assessments of Global Train and Equip projects. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD update guidance for project proposal packages to require an explanation when sustainment plans are not documented for projects for which sustainment is not intended or anticipated. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-44": "Why GAO Did This Study The Judgment Fund is a permanent, indefinite appropriation, statutorily created in 1956, available to pay many types of eligible monetary claims that may be judicially or administratively ordered against the U.S. government. The Fund is also available to pay interest and costs on claims in certain circumstances. In connection with its oversight efforts, the Committee requested certain information from Treasury about Judgment Fund balances, activities, and other information. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the extent to which the information the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) provided to the Committee responds to the Committee's May 2017 request for information about Judgment Fund balances and activities and reconciles to financial information included in annual, audited financial reports and other selected reports and (2) describe the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's (Fiscal Service) documented procedures and related control activities for processing agency requests for payments from the Judgment Fund, including how Fiscal Service ensures that appropriate agency official approve claims and what reviews are required, if any, to ensure receipt of required documentation. GAO reviewed Treasury's documentation and interviewed Treasury officials. What GAO Found In response to the House Committee on the Judiciary (Committee) request for Schedules of the Judgment Fund Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs, and Custodial Revenues prepared in accordance with U.S. Government Accounting Policy (GAAP) and related information, Treasury provided to the Committee nine \"exhibits\" that contained selected information on Judgment Fund payments and other related information to answer nine questions in the Committee's request. GAO reviewed the Treasury-provided information and found that it did not provide the Schedules of Judgment Fund Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs, and Custodial Revenues for fiscal years 2010 through 2016, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and appropriate note disclosures or MD&A to the Committee, as requested. In addition, GAO identified numerous differences between amounts included in the exhibits provided to the Committee and those reported in Treasury's (1) unaudited transparency reports, (2) audited Schedules, or (3) audited Financial Statements. For example, GAO identified differences between administrative and litigative payments for fiscal years 2010 through 2016 reported on Exhibits 1 and 2 - Judgment Fund Administrative and Litigative Payments by Defendant Agency and Fiscal Year and those reported in Treasury's (1) unaudited transparency reports, (2) audited Schedules, or (3) audited Financial Statements, for all years presented. Further, GAO identified numerous differences between financial and nonfinancial information in Treasury's exhibits and comparable information contained only in the transparency reports. For example, the Committee asked Treasury to disclose the amount of Judgment Fund payments for attorneys' fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. In response, Treasury provided Exhibit 8 - Amounts Paid from the Judgment Fund for EAJA Claims by Fiscal Year. GAO compared total payments for each fiscal year reported in Exhibit 8 with those reported in the transparency reports for the same years and identified differences in payments for principal, attorneys' fees, and costs. GAO provided Treasury the results of its comparisons and requested explanations for the differences GAO identified, and Treasury provided explanations for some of them. Subsequently, Treasury officials informed GAO that they discovered that the exhibits were created in a faulty manner, and rather than expending resources to reconcile and explain the numerous differences GAO identified, they indicated that Fiscal Service staff would submit new exhibits to the Committee; however, they did not provide a date by which they would do so. Judgment Fund Branch staff further explained that the Committee's request was a unique request for information that could not be fulfilled with existing standard reports and queries. To respond to the request, Fiscal Service created ad hoc queries of the Judgment Fund Internet Claims System (JFICS) database using different instructions for extracting data for the exhibits than those used for creating the transparency reports. The Judgment Fund Branch relied on these ad hoc queries, primarily from JFICS, to prepare the exhibits answering the nine questions included in the Committee's request. However, according to Judgment Fund Branch officials, the Judgment Fund Branch does not prepare financial statements, such as the Schedules of Non-Entity Assets, Non-Entity Costs, and Custodial Revenues.",
    "gao_GAO-18-356": "Why GAO Did This Study VAMCs play a critical role in providing veterans with timely and quality health care. GAO was asked to review the patient advocacy program. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA has provided guidance to VAMCs on the governance of the patient advocacy program, (2) the extent to which VHA has trained patient advocates, and (3) the extent to which VHA has monitored patient advocacy data-entry practices and reviewed patient advocacy data to assess program performance and identify system-wide improvements. GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed VHA officials. GAO also visited eight VAMCs selected based on the number of veterans who received veterans' feedback and the number of complaints they received. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has provided limited guidance to medical centers (VAMC) on the governance of the patient advocacy program. Specifically, VHA provided limited guidance on how to meet the program's expectations that veterans have easy access to a patient advocate who will hear their complaints and address them in a timely manner. While VHA's handbook for the program provides general information on the responsibilities of patient advocacy program staff, it does not specify the VAMC department to which patient advocates should report to help ensure VAMCs meet these expectations. According to VHA officials, the lack of specific guidance was intentional and due in part to VHA officials' view that leadership at each VAMC is in the best position to understand the needs of veterans at their facilities, and therefore should have flexibility to make decisions about governance in response to those needs. In addition, VHA's patient advocacy program handbook is out of date and does not incorporate recent agency-wide changes, such as those made in response to VHA Strategic Plan FY 2013 \u2013 2018 which identifies the goal of providing proactive, patient-driven health care. The handbook for the program was issued in 2005, expired in 2010, and as of January 2018, no updates had been released. In the absence of an updated document, VAMCs are still expected to follow the outdated handbook. However, the handbook does not identify the responsibilities of the current VHA office responsible for overseeing the program. Instead, it identifies the responsibilities of the VHA office that oversaw the program before OPCC&CT began overseeing the program in 2011. In recent years, OPCC&CT reviewed the implementation of the patient advocacy program at some VAMCs and provided specific recommendations on how to change program governance to better reflect a more proactive patient advocacy program model. However, the recommendations from these reviews were provided only to some VAMCs; guidance that could be applicable to all VAMCs was not added to the handbook. Until actions to address the weaknesses GAO found are completed, guidance on the governance of the program will continue to be lacking. VHA has recommended training for patient advocates, but has not developed an approach to routinely assess their training needs or monitor the completion of training. Specifically, VHA officials stated that they relied on VAMC and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) staff to conduct these assessments. However, VHA's handbook for the program does not specify that VAMC or VISN officials are responsible for conducting routine assessments of patient advocates' training needs. Until actions to address the weaknesses GAO found are completed, the lack of routine assessments of training needs will continue to put the patient advocacy program at risk of not meeting its goals. VHA has not monitored patient advocacy data-entry practices or reviewed patient advocacy data to assess program performance and identify system-wide improvements. Specifically, VHA officials have not monitored the data-entry practices of patient advocacy program staff to ensure that all complaints were entered into the Patient Advocate Tracking System (PATS) and issue codes were assigned consistently to ROCs. Rather, they relied on VISN and VAMC officials to ensure that program staff entered all complaints into PATS. OPCC&CT officials stated that they relied on VISN and VAMC officials to ensure that program staff entered all complaints into PATS. However, GAO found inconsistencies in the extent to which VAMC officials entered complaints into PATS, with complaints always entered into PATS at one of GAO's selected VAMCs, while at other VAMCs some complaints were left unrecorded, according to officials. Until these actions are completed, however, the gaps in monitoring of PATS data-entry practices that GAO identified will continue to exist, putting the program at risk of incomplete or unreliable data that may not allow an accurate understanding of veterans' complaints, critical to making system-wide improvements. VHA officials have not systematically reviewed PATS data to assess program performance and identify potential system-wide improvements, goals of the patient advocacy program. Specifically, OPCC",
    "gao_GAO-19-93": "Why GAO Did This Study FEMA and USACE are responsible for coordinating federal disaster response efforts. FEMA and USACE obligated about $4.5 billion in advance contracts in response to the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires. GAO was asked to review FEMA's use of advance contracts. This report addresses the extent to which (1) FEMA and USACE used advance contracts, (2) the planning, management, and reporting of selected FEMA and USACE advance contracts met certain contracting requirements, and (3) FEMA and USACE identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of these contracts. GAO reviewed FEMA and USACE advance contract obligations and contract documentation, and interviewed FEMA and USACE officials. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) obligated about $4.5 billion in advance contracts in response to the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, but FEMA lacks an updated strategy and guidance on the use of advance contracts. FEMA and USACE obligated about $3.8 billion in advance contract obligations as of May 31, 2018. FEMA and USACE obligated about $4.5 billion in advance contract obligations for the three hurricanes and more than three quarters of the contract obligations identified by those agencies for the California wildfires. However, an outdated strategy and lack of guidance to contracting officers resulted in confusion about whether and how to prioritize and use advance contracts to quickly mobilize resources in response to the 2017 disasters. FEMA's 2007 strategy does not provide direction on the objectives of advance contracts or how they should be prioritized in relation to new post-disaster contract awards. FEMA officials acknowledged that additional guidance regarding advance contracts, including their availability and use during a disaster, could be useful. Without an updated strategy and guidance on the use of advance contracts and how they should be prioritized and used in relation to new post-disaster contract awards, FEMA lacks reasonable assurance that it is maximizing the use of advance contracts to quickly and cost-effectively provide goods and services following a disaster. FEMA and USACE used a variety of advance contracts to respond to the 2017 disasters, but GAO found weaknesses in the process of awarding and overseeing selected advance contracts in its review. These weaknesses were: (1) challenges in FEMA's acquisition planning; (2) limited record keeping or management of certain FEMA contracts; and (3) incomplete reporting on FEMA's advance contract actions to certain congressional committees. Related to USACE, GAO did not identify any planning or management challenges based on its review of its four selected contracts, and USACE is not required to report on its advance contract actions to the congressional committees. FEMA and USACE have processes for identifying and assessing lessons learned from the 2017 disasters, but challenges remain in coordinating with and providing information to state and local governments on the use of advance contracts. FEMA and USACE have processes for identifying and assessing lessons learned from the 2017 disasters, but contracting officials from these agencies identified several lessons learned from the 2017 disasters that directly affected their use of advance contracts. These include the need for: (1) additional advance contracts for certain goods and services; (2) flexibility to increase contract ceilings; (3) use of USACE's debris removal advance contracts to respond to the California wildfires; and (4) federal coordination and information sharing with state and local governments on advance contracts. While officials identified some lessons learned, they also identified challenges related to FEMA's outreach with state and local governments on advance contracting efforts. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FEMA update its strategy and guidance on advance contract use, and improve its planning, management, and reporting of advance contracts. FEMA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-56": "Why GAO Did This Study The Forest Service is responsible for managing the nation's forests and grasslands, managing the productivity of those lands for the benefit of citizens, conserving open space, and conducting research and development in the biological, physical, and social sciences. The Forest Service's budgetary resources are primarily appropriations. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which (1) the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's processes and control activities, policies and procedures, and other documentation related to its budget authority processes, reimbursable agreements, and unliquidated obligations. GAO also interviewed key Forest Service officials. What GAO Found The Forest Service did not properly design control activities for its allotments process, administrative control of funds, and fund transfers. While the Forest Service had documented processes for allotting its budgetary resources, it did not have an adequate process and related control activities for reasonably assuring that (1) amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated and (2) unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need. In addition, the Forest Service did not have a properly designed and documented system for administrative control of funds. The Forest Service issued guidance related to administrative control of funds in manuals and handbooks, which USDA did not review and approve prior to their issuance. GAO found that the processes and related control activities over the administrative control of funds were dispersed in numerous manuals and handbooks, which may hamper a clear understanding of the overall system. Further, the Forest Service did not have a properly designed and documented system for administrative control of funds. The Forest Service entered into various reimbursable agreements with agencies within the Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities to carry out its mission for public benefit. The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations. In addition, processes and related control activities applicable to reimbursable agreements were not adequately described in applicable manuals and handbooks in its Directive System, to reasonably assure that control activities could be performed consistently and effectively. Further, certain RACA processes in the Directive System had not been timely reviewed by management and did not reflect current processes. Moreover, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks related to the review of unliquidated obligations did not clearly describe control activities and were not timely reviewed by management. The Forest Service reported unliquidated obligations of approximately $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in its financial statements as of September 30, 2015, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, the Forest Service deobligated about $319 million of its unliquidated obligations from prior years. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Forest Service (1) revise its process and design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that appropriated amounts are used for the purposes designated; (2) design, document, and implement a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds; and (3) design, document, and implement a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unliquidated obligations are reviewed timely and appropriate actions are taken. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report's findings.",
    "gao_GAO-19-67": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2018, PAMA required CMS to phase in payment rates for laboratory tests that are performed individually or in a group. PAMA also required GAO to review the implementation of PAMA. This report examines (1) the extent to which CMS collected private-payer data from laboratories required to report private-payer data and (2) the extent to which CMS implemented PAMA's provisions and CMS's actions to address challenges related to private-payer data. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed private-payer data from CMS; and interviewed CMS officials and laboratory industry representatives. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) collected private-payer data from about 2,000 laboratories to develop new payment rates for individual laboratory tests on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS). CMS used these data to calculate a median, private-payer rate, weighted by volume and phased in this change by limiting payment-rate reductions to 10 percent per year. Beginning in 2018, these new payment rates served as the single, national payment rate for individual laboratory tests. These payment rates were lower than the corresponding 2017 CLFS national limitation amounts (the maximum that CMS would pay for laboratory tests) for approximately 88 percent of tests. CMS analyzed private-payer data it collected from about 2,000 laboratories to develop new payment rates for individual laboratory tests on the CLFS. CMS emphasized the importance of collecting complete data on private-payer rates in order to set accurate Medicare rates. However, CMS did not collect complete data from all laboratories required to report. Specifically, CMS estimated that laboratories subject to reporting requirements would receive more than 90 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office laboratories and independent laboratories. However, the laboratories that reported private-payer data received less than 70 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. CMS concluded that it collected sufficient private-payer data to set Medicare payment rates and that collecting more data from additional laboratories that were required to report would not significantly affect Medicare expenditures. GAO estimated that if CMS needed to collect 20 percent more data for its collection to be complete, doing so could increase Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by as much as 3 percent or reduce them by as much as 3 percent depending on the payment rates in these additional data. However, if annual limits to Medicare payment-rate reductions were not applied, collecting these additional data could increase CLFS expenditures by as much as 9 percent or reduce them by as much as 9 percent depending on the payment rates in these additional data. GAO found that CMS mitigated challenges to setting accurate Medicare payment rates by identifying and excluding potentially inaccurate private-payer data that could have led to paying more than necessary. CMS addressed potentially inaccurate private-payer data by identifying and excluding potentially inaccurate data. CMS removed or replaced data from four reporting entities that appeared to have or confirmed having reported revenue\u2014which is the payment rate multiplied by the volume of tests paid at that rate\u2014instead of payment rates. GAO estimated that if CMS had included these data, CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 would have increased by 7 percent. CMS's implementation of PAMA's provisions and CMS's actions to address challenges related to private-payer data could lead to Medicare paying more than necessary for some tests. CMS eliminated bundled payment rates for panel tests that lack billing codes and started paying separately for each component test instead. CMS also implemented the 2018 CLFS in a manner that could lead to unbundling payment rates for panel tests with billing codes. If payment rates for all panel tests were unbundled, GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures could increase by $218 million for panel tests that lack billing codes and by as much as $10.1 billion for panel tests with billing codes from 2018 through 2020. CMS also estimated that there could be significant risks of paying more than necessary associated with unbundling and has taken initial steps to monitor these risks and explore possible responses, but had not yet responded to these risks as of July 2018. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS (1) collect all data from all laboratories required to report, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests, consistent with its practice prior to 2018, rather than paying for them individually. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-61": "Why GAO Did This Study The most common kind of skin cancer is associated with exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. FDA regulates sunscreens as OTC drugs, which are drugs considered to be safe for use by consumers without the intervention of a health care professional. FDA also regulates sunscreen active ingredients, which are ingredients that are added to an OTC monograph to protect against UVA rays. SIA required FDA to review applications for sunscreen active ingredients within the time frames required by SIA. GAO was asked to review FDA's review of applications for active ingredients. This report examines (1) the steps FDA has taken to review applications for active ingredients, and (2) the steps FDA has taken to review applications for sunscreen active ingredients. GAO reviewed FDA's review of applications for active ingredients, and interviewed FDA officials and representatives of the sponsors of the eight sunscreen active ingredient applications that were submitted prior to SIA. GAO also interviewed FDA officials and representatives of the sponsors of the six non-sunscreen active ingredient applications that were submitted prior to SIA. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented requirements for reviewing applications for sunscreen active ingredients within the time frames required by the Sunscreen Innovation Act (SIA). FDA issued final guidance for applications for sunscreen active ingredients, and issued its first required report to Congress on specific performance metrics, such as the number of sunscreen applications with pending GRASE determinations. In May 2016, FDA also issued its first required report to Congress on specific performance metrics, such as the number of sunscreen applications with pending GRASE determinations. In addition, SIA requires FDA to finalize the sunscreen monograph by November 26, 2019. FDA completed its review of the safety and effectiveness data for each of the eight sunscreen active ingredient applications that it received prior to the enactment of SIA. The agency concluded that the ingredients were not GRASE because the data were insufficient to make a determination, and that additional data are needed to determine otherwise. Sponsors questioned FDA's request for additional data and no data have been provided. FDA officials said that the agency has not received any of the additional safety and effectiveness data requested for the eight sunscreen active ingredient applications seeking a GRASE determination. Sponsor representatives and stakeholders questioned FDA's request for additional data and no data have been provided. FDA officials said that the agency has not received any of the additional safety and effectiveness data requested for the eight sunscreen active ingredient applications seeking a GRASE determination. Some stakeholders said that they agree with FDA on the need for testing to ensure the safety and effectiveness of sunscreen ingredients, but some of them said the agency should also consider the potential benefit of preventing skin cancer if new ingredients\u2014which could offer better protection against UVA rays\u2014become available for the U.S. market. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-279": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has emphasized strengthening law enforcement efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, and using financial rewards to obtain information on illegal activities is one tool that some federal agencies have used. However, to date, FWS and NOAA have not prioritized the use of rewards and were unable to provide sufficient assurance that the 27 rewards they paid during fiscal years 2007 through 2017 represented all of the rewards they provided during that period. GAO was asked to review the use of financial rewards. This report (1) identifies laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which these agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) evaluates FWS's and NOAA's policies on financial rewards, (3) evaluates the information available to the public on financial rewards, and (4) determines the extent to which FWS and NOAA reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking. GAO analyzed FWS and NOAA data on financial rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Department of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported paying few financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. FWS and NOAA officials identified multiple laws that authorize the payment of financial rewards to people who provide information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards under these laws from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. However, agency officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the reward information they provided to GAO represented all of the rewards they paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. FWS and NOAA officials said they tracked all their expenditures, including reward payments, in their financial databases, but they are not able to readily identify reward payments because their financial systems do not include a unique identifier for such payments and their reward information is located in multiple databases and formats. As a result, FWS and NOAA officials said they manually reviewed their financial and law enforcement records to identify instances when the agency paid rewards and then retrieved additional information from their financial and law enforcement databases, such as final payment amounts. By tracking reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, FWS and NOAA can better ensure that they have complete information on the rewards they have paid to help manage their use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. FWS and NOAA have policies outlining the processes their law enforcement agents are to use in making reward payments, and NOAA's policy specifies factors for its agents to consider in developing proposed reward amounts, such as the risk the individual took in collecting the information. FWS's policy does not specify such factors that could inform agents in achieving the agency's objectives, which is not consistent with federal internal control standards. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare defensible reward proposals. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards or considered whether any changes might improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. FWS officials said their agency has not reviewed or considered changes to its use of rewards because the agency has not prioritized the use of rewards. NOAA officials said their agency has not focused on using rewards or identified the need to review its use of this tool, particularly in light of other, higher mission priorities. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FWS and NOAA track reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, augment their policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, and develop and implement plans to do so. The Departments of Commerce and the Interior concurred with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-323": "Why GAO Did This Study The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers the national railroad retirement system, which provides retirement, disability, and survivors benefits to about 400,000 rail workers and their dependents. RRB calculates the amount that the Social Security Administration (SSA) would have collected in taxes from rail workers and their employers, and what SSA would have paid in benefits if rail workers had been covered under Social Security. The interchange also serves as a vehicle to fund Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) benefits for rail workers. GAO was asked to review the financial interchange. This report examines (1) how RRB calculates the amount of the financial interchange and how it compares with the amount that SSA and HHS would have paid to rail workers and their beneficiaries, (2) the factors that have contributed to the financial interchange, and (3) the extent to which RRB oversees the process. GAO reviewed RRB and SSA documents and data, and interviewed RRB, SSA, and HHS officials. What GAO Found RRB calculates the amount of the financial interchange each year by calculating key flows in and out of SSA and HHS trust funds. RRB calculates the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. RRB calculates the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. By law, the agencies must complete their determination by June of each year. RRB calculates the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. By law, the agencies must complete their determination by June of each year. RRB calculates the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. RRB calculates the administrative costs involved with paying benefits, and interest for the time between the determination of the interchange amount and its actual transfer. SSA is credited for the amount of payroll and income taxes it would have collected from rail workers and for income taxes that would have been paid by RRB beneficiaries on Social Security equivalent benefits. The net of the five amounts is the amount that is transferred. RRB calculates the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year.

RRB calculates the financial interchange amount each year, which is done on a retrospective basis, i.e., the amount is determined for the previous fiscal year. By law, the agencies must complete their determination by June of each year. RRB calculates the Medicare payroll taxes and income taxes paid by rail workers and transfers this amount, less administrative expenses, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Overall, the procedures GAO observed, and which RRB explained and demonstrated, for calculating the financial interchange are consistent with the methodology agreed to by RRB, SSA, and HHS. RRB has collected payroll taxes for HHS since 1966. From 1966 through 2016, RRB reported that it transferred a total of $30 billion in 2016 dollars through the financial interchange to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. RRB takes a number of steps to oversee the financial interchange calculation, but shortcomings in its controls increase the risk of errors. For example, RRB has limited documentation and does not have formal policies to guide several key aspects of the financial interchange calculation. While GAO did not identify any actual errors in its calculations, these shortcomings in its controls increase the risk of calculations being carried out inconsistently or incorrectly. For example, RRB does not have current or complete documentation related to the computer system it uses to compute the financial interchange. Federal internal control standards state that effective documentation assists in management's design of internal controls and can mitigate the risk that knowledge is limited to a few staff. Without such documentation, RRB puts itself at risk of staff carrying out actions inconsistently, losing operational knowledge when staff leave or retire, and complicating oversight of its operations. Lastly, SSA and HHS increase the risk of errors by not performing case-level reviews of financial interchange calculations. This is especially true for the SSA portion of the interchange, which involves complex calculations performed according to SSA rules. In its role as the administrator of the Office of the Administrative Supplemental Insurance and Disability Insurance programs, SSA is best positioned to determine",
    "gao_GAO-19-25": "Why GAO Did This Study DOE and NNSA have faced recurring project management problems, including cost and schedule problems at the MOX project. In October 2018, NNSA terminated the project. GAO was asked to review project management issues at the MOX project. This report examines (1) when NNSA's project management oversight processes recognized cost and schedule problems at the MOX project and the actions the agency took to address them and (2) the extent to which DOE requires that project management lessons learned from MOX and other projects be documented and shared. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DOE, NNSA, and MOX Services, the contractor constructing the MOX project. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) recognized indicators of cost and schedule problems at the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project after strengthening its project management oversight in 2010 and 2011, but did not fully resolve four key problems. First, information about the contractor's use of inaccurate rates to estimate the time needed to complete certain construction activities\u2014 commonly referred to as unit rates or planned production rates\u2014indicated that the project would not be completed within its approved cost estimate. Second, the MOX contractor's annual forecasted estimates for the project consistently increased from 2008 through 2011, and the level of confidence in those estimates decreased, indicating that the project would not be completed within its approved cost estimate. Third, information about the use of management reserve funds early in the project indicated that the project would not be completed within its approved baseline. Fourth, information about the use of management reserve funds early in the project indicated that the project would not be completed within its approved baseline. To address cost increases experienced early in the project, the MOX contractor began to use the project's management reserve funds. In response to the significant cost increases, schedule delays, and project risks captured in the MOX contractor's updated cost and schedule estimate, NNSA proposed a slowdown of MOX project construction activities in its fiscal year 2014 budget request to begin assessing alternative plutonium disposition strategies. DOE has requirements for documenting and sharing project management lessons learned, but they do not ensure consistent or timely documentation or the evaluation of corrective actions. DOE Order 413.3B requires project management staff to document and share project management lessons learned on capital asset projects like MOX but does not require that all project management lessons learned from capital asset projects be documented consistently or shared in a timely manner. Moreover, DOE Order 413.3B does not require the evaluation of the results of corrective actions taken in response to lessons learned that are identified during the course of capital asset projects such as the MOX project. By developing requirements for sharing project management lessons learned from the beginning of a project routinely and in a timely manner to improve DOE's ability to identify and evaluate problematic practices and positive experiences, DOE\u2014including NNSA\u2014could help improve the success of future capital asset projects and avoid the problems encountered on the MOX project. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOE develop requirements for sharing project management lessons learned from the beginning of a project routinely and in a timely manner to improve DOE's ability to identify and evaluate problematic practices and positive experiences. DOE concurred with the recommendations and described actions it intends to take in response.",

The watershed is a complex system of dams, pumps, reservoirs, and other facilities that have diverted water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to agricultural, industrial, and urban consumers in the Bay area and southern parts of California. The watershed is also the largest estuary in North America, containing more than 700,000 acres of farmland and more than 700,000 acres of farmland. The watershed is also the largest estuary in North America, containing more than 700,000 acres of farmland and more than 700,000 acres of farmland. GAO was asked to review the watershed. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal and nonfederal entities coordinate comprehensive restoration efforts in the watershed, (2) the status of all restoration efforts across the watershed, and (3) the extent to which federal and nonfederal entities identify factors that may limit or pose a risk to restoration efforts. GAO reviewed federal and nonfederal documents and interviewed federal and nonfederal officials. GAO also surveyed 48 federal and nonfederal entities, selected based on geographic location, water quality, and other factors. What GAO Found Federal and nonfederal entities, including state agencies and nongovernmental organizations, carry out and coordinate a wide range of restoration efforts in the San Francisco Bay Delta watershed. These entities coordinate comprehensive restoration efforts in the Bay and Delta primarily through two coordinating bodies\u2014the San Francisco Estuary Partnership and the Delta Plan Interagency Implementation Committee, respectively. In the upper watershed, federal and nonfederal entities do not have a coordinating body for comprehensive restoration efforts, but they coordinate restoration efforts through plans specific to entities, projects, or restoration topics. In 2009, federal entities first developed an Interim Federal Action Plan for coordinating federal restoration efforts across the entire watershed, but not all of the entities are using the plan. By updating or revising the plan to outline and reflect entities' roles and responsibilities in light of the changes in the state's role and other relevant developments since 2009, and notifying all participating entities to ensure they are aware of the plan and their role in it, Interior and the California Delta Stewardship Council could help clarify the federal government's role in supporting restoration efforts in the watershed and help ensure the effective use of federal resources in these efforts. Information on the status of all restoration efforts across the watershed, including their accomplishments, is unknown because, while the information is being developed, complete and current information is not being fully collected or reported. Total expenditures for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 are unknown, in part because federal reports do not include complete or reliable expenditure data. Federal and nonfederal entities identified several factors that may limit or pose a risk to restoration efforts in the watershed, such as competing interests, coordination, and climate change. For example, one nonfederal entity said that the distribution of water and other natural resources among competing interests is not clearly defined or not distributed in a method that satisfies all parties. By directing staff to update its written guidance for federal and state agencies on submitting data for its budget crosscut reports, OMB would have more reasonable assurance that it is helping those agencies provide current, complete, and accurate data to help decision makers achieve restoration objectives. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (1) update or revise the Interim Federal Action Plan to outline and reflect entities' roles and responsibilities in light of changes in the state's role and other relevant developments since 2009, and (2) coordinate with the appropriate state entities to obtain and report the information available to meet the CALFED Act's requirements. Interior partially concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-452T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to government information. The act also requires agencies to report annually to Justice on their FOIA implementation. GAO was asked to review the implementation of FOIA. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which selected agencies have implemented FOIA requirements, (2) the size of their FOIA request backlogs, and (3) the extent to which agencies have used statutory exemptions to withhold information from the public. GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed the 18 agencies selected for review, based on the number of FOIA requests received and processed. GAO also interviewed officials from Justice, NARA, and the Department of State. What GAO Found The 18 selected agencies GAO reviewed fully implemented half of the six FOIA requirements evaluated and the vast majority of agencies implemented two additional requirements. Specifically, 18 agencies updated response letters, implemented tracking systems, 15 agencies provided required records online, and 12 designated chief FOIA officers. However, only 5 of the agencies published and updated their FOIA regulations in a timely and comprehensive manner. Until these agencies publish updated regulations that address the necessary requirements, as called for in FOIA and Office of Information Policy guidance, they likely will be unable to provide the public with required regulatory and procedural information to ensure transparency and accountability in the government. The 18 selected agencies in GAO's review had FOIA request backlogs of varying sizes, ranging from no backlogged requests at some agencies to 45,000 or more requests at other agencies. Generally, the agencies with the largest backlogs had received the most requests. In an effort to aid agencies in reducing their backlogs, Justice's Office of Information Policy (OIP) identified key practices that agencies can use. However, while the agencies reported using these practices and other methods, few of them managed to reduce their backlogs during the period from fiscal year 2012 through 2016. In particular, of the four agencies with the largest backlogs, only one\u2014NARA\u2014reduced its backlog. Agencies attributed their inability to decrease backlogs to the number and complexity of requests, among other factors. However, agencies also lack comprehensive plans to implement practices on an ongoing basis. During fiscal years 2010 to 2016, agencies claimed 237 statutes as the basis for withholding information. Of these statutes, 75 were included on Justice's list of qualifying statutes under the statutory (b)(3) exemption. Further, of the 237 statutes claimed by agencies, 103 were enacted or amended after 2009 and, thus, were subject to the requirement of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, which requires that any statute enacted after 2009 specifically cite paragraph (b)(3) of FOIA to qualify as a withholding statute. What GAO Recommends GAO is making 23 recommendations to selected agencies to address posting records online, designating chief FOIA officers, updating regulations consistent with requirements, and developing plans to reduce backlogs. The recommendations address posting records online, designating chief FOIA officers, updating regulations consistent with requirements, and developing plans to reduce backlogs.",

The Sound is a national priority for restoring and protecting the Sound. In 1994, the Long Island Sound Study, a partnership of federal and state agencies, nonprofit and public organizations, and individuals, developed a comprehensive conservation and management plan to restore and protect the Sound. The act required the Study to report biennially on progress made in implementing the plan. GAO was asked to review progress made toward achieving the goals of the plan. This report examines (1) what is known about the progress made toward achieving the 1994 plan; (2) the goals of the 2015 plan and factors that may hinder progress according to Study members; (3) how Study members plan to measure and report on progress toward the goals of the 2015 plan; and (4) what Study members expended on restoration activities in fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and cost estimates for future activities. GAO analyzed the plan and interviewed Study members, EPA officials, and subject matter experts. What GAO Found The Long Island Sound Study (the Study) has collected a wide range of data to measure the health of Long Island Sound and has issued periodic progress reports since 2001, but these progress reports have not contained a comprehensive assessment of progress toward the goals of the 1994 plan. In the absence of a comprehensive assessment of progress, Study members GAO interviewed said that they believe that moderate progress has been made toward goals associated with five of the six priority problems identified in the 1994 plan. The Study has collected a wide range of data to measure the health of Long Island Sound and has issued periodic progress reports since 2001. However, these progress reports have not contained a comprehensive assessment of progress toward the goals of the 1994 plan. In the absence of a comprehensive assessment of progress, Study members said that they believe that moderate progress has been made toward goals associated with five of the six priority problems identified in the 1994 plan. The 2015 plan has four goals to improve water quality and restore and protect ecosystem functions, among others. Each goal is associated with one of four broad themes: clean water and healthy watersheds, thriving habitats and wildlife, sustainable and resilient communities, and sound science and inclusive management. To achieve the goals, the Study developed specific outcomes, objectives, strategies, and action plans but stated that factors such as insufficient funding and climate change may hinder restoration efforts. In addition, most Study members stated that even if the goals of the 2015 plan are met, new and emerging challenges will require restoration efforts to continue, at a minimum, to monitor the Sound. Study members said that they plan to use 20 long-term targets with associated indicators to measure progress toward the goals associated with the four themes of the 2015 plan. While 18 of the long-term targets currently have numerical goals, they do not yet have associated intermediate targets that can be used to monitor progress; but EPA officials said that the Study is working to establish them. In March 2018, the Study issued web pages for each of the 20 targets to report on such progress, but, as of June 2018, these pages do not yet fully incorporate leading practices of performance reporting. By working with the Study as it finalizes its reporting format to incorporate leading practices of performance reporting, EPA could help ensure that the Study provides the public and Congress with the information they need to determine whether the Study is making progress toward achieving the long-term targets associated with the goals of the 2015 plan, or whether the Study should take additional action to meet the targets. Seven Study members expended at least $466 million on restoration activities in the Sound from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, although the total expenditures by all Study members over this period are unknown. In the 2015 plan, the Study estimated that future activities will cost at least $18.9 billion over 20 years, but these estimates may not reflect all future restoration costs because they address only some of the plan's long-term targets. By working with the Study to develop cost estimates that include analyses of uncertainties for each of the targets in the plan, EPA and the Study could better estimate the comprehensive costs for Long Island Sound restoration and ensure better resource allocation decisions for the Sound. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Director of the Long Island Sound Study, working with the Study, develop cost estimates that include analyses of uncertainties for each of the targets in the 2015 plan. EPA agreed with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-103": "Why GAO Did This Study FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that causes fever and painful lesions on cloven-hoofed animals' hooves, mouths, and udders. FMD can spread from one animal species to another. The United States is vulnerable to FMD transmission, given the large size and mobility of the U.S. livestock sector. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the lead agency for responding to outbreaks of foreign animal diseases, including FMD. GAO was asked to review USDA's FMD response efforts. This report (1) describes USDA's planned approach for responding to FMD outbreaks; (2) identifies what challenges, if any, USDA would face in pursuing its FMD response goals; and (3) examines how USDA identifies, prioritizes, and monitors corrective actions to mitigate these challenges. GAO reviewed USDA documents and FMD response plans and FMD preparedness exercises; interviewed USDA officials and others with expertise with FMD; and analyzed USDA data on FMD outbreaks. What GAO Found The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed several different, but not mutually exclusive, FMD response strategies that the agency will consider to control and eradicate FMD in an outbreak as part of its planned approach. These strategies rely on stamping out\u2014killing and disposing of\u2014infected and susceptible animals, vaccination of uninfected animals, or both. For strategies involving vaccination, options include killing and disposing of vaccinated animals (vaccinate-to-kill), allowing the animals to be slaughtered and their meat processed (vaccinate-to-slaughter), or allowing the animals to live out their useful lifespan (vaccinate-to-live). Response strategies would likely change as an outbreak unfolds, and might also vary by region or type of animal affected. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has developed overarching guidance for responding to animal disease outbreaks and detailed procedures for many response activities. A majority of respondents to GAO's questionnaire indicated that in 10 of the 11 areas USDA would face challenges that are significant\u2014that is, important enough to be worthy of USDA action. For the 11th area, which is communication and coordination, opinions were split on whether the area would present significant challenges. The 11th area, which is communication and coordination, was not a challenge. To mitigate challenges in responding to potential FMD outbreaks, USDA's APHIS has identified corrective actions through preparedness exercises, surveys, and lessons learned in other outbreaks, as called for in its FMD preparedness procedures. However, APHIS has not consistently followed its procedures for prioritizing or monitoring the completion of these actions. For example, APHIS has not developed a process for prioritizing and allocating its supply of FMD vaccine. Without following its procedures for prioritizing and monitoring corrective actions, APHIS cannot ensure that it is allocating its limited resources to the most beneficial actions to prepare for a possible FMD outbreak. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that USDA follow its procedures for prioritizing and monitoring corrective actions for FMD preparedness. USDA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-494": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for reviewing and investigating transactions involving foreign companies and U.S. businesses. CFIUS is a committee that reviews and investigates transactions that may pose national security risks. GAO was asked to review DOD's CFIUS process. This report assesses (1) factors, if any, that affect DOD's ability to (1) identify and address national security concerns through the CFIUS process, and (2) develop and monitor mitigation agreements through the CFIUS process. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed DOD and Treasury officials. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of seven transactions involving foreign acquisitions and U.S. businesses. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) faces challenges identifying and addressing national security concerns through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the Unites States (CFIUS) process. DOD has reviewed hundreds of transactions involving foreign acquirers and U.S. businesses since 2012, but faces several challenges in identifying and addressing national security concerns through the CFIUS process. These challenges are: (1) resources not aligned with an increasing workload; (2) some national security concerns not defined or addressed in DOD's Instruction; (3) some investments that pose national security concerns not always able to be addressed through the CFIUS process; and (4) current component reviewer responsibilities and CFIUS processes not reflected in DOD's Instruction. DOD is responsible for most of the CFIUS mitigation agreements, but faces a variety of challenges when taking action to mitigate national security concerns and ensure the effectiveness of the agreements. These challenges relate to insufficient personnel resources compared to the Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy's (MIBP) workload, and unclear communication about the delineation of responsibilities between MIBP and the DOD components. Moreover, DOD has not reported to Congress on its responsibilities for monitoring and enforcing mitigation agreements. A 2013 House Report asked the Secretary of Defense to review the role of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of MIBP in monitoring CFIUS mitigation agreements in which DOD was the lead or co-lead and determine if the Defense Security Service is suited to perform these functions, and report the findings. DOD was to report on the findings in 2013, but it has been delayed because disagreement exists within DOD regarding where responsibility for monitoring mitigation agreements should reside. As of January 2018, MIBP officials said that while they recognize the need to complete the response, DOD has not committed to a specific time frame for the response. Reporting the findings to the congressional defense committees will facilitate the identification of current challenges related to CFIUS mitigation agreement oversight, and could address questions about the capabilities and responsibilities necessary to effectively monitor and enforce mitigation agreements. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD assess CFIUS resource requirements, prioritize personnel and funding resources accordingly to review, mitigate, and monitor transactions that are of concern to the department, and update its guidance to reflect current requirements and reporting on reviews requested by a committee of Congress on the department's responsibilities for monitoring mitigation agreements. DOD and Treasury concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-406": "Why GAO Did This Study The Judicial Conference of the United States is the national policy-making body of the federal courts. The Judicial Conference delegated authority to redact information from financial disclosure reports to the Committee on Financial Disclosure. Upon request from a judicial official, the committee, in consultation with the USMS, redacts the information when it decides that revealing such personal or sensitive information could endanger the judicial official or a member of his or her family. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, requires specified judicial, legislative, and executive branch officials to file annual financial disclosure reports in the spring of each year. GAO was asked to review the judiciary's redaction authority. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Judicial Conference has developed procedures to ensure judicial officials file financial disclosure reports, and the number of reports released annually, and (2) the extent to which the Judicial Conference has submitted required annual redaction reports to Congress in a timely manner. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed AOUSC data on redaction requests; and interviewed AOUSC officials. What GAO Found The Judicial Conference of the United States has developed procedures to help ensure judicial officials file their financial disclosure reports. Specifically, the Judicial Conference has developed an electronic report filing system, written guidance, and a compliance process to help ensure judicial officials file their financial disclosure reports. The Judicial Conference also provides guidance to judicial officials to ensure that financial disclosure reports are filed correctly. The number of financial disclosure reports released each year varied from 2012 through 2016. The number of judicial officials who requested redactions represents a small percentage of the total number of financial disclosure reports filed in recent years. The number of redaction requests ranged from a low of 112 in 2014 to a high of 162 in 2012 and 2015. For calendar years 2012 through 2016, there were a total of 716 requests for redaction of information from judicial officials' financial disclosure reports\u2014711 from judges and 5 from judicial employees\u2014with a yearly average of about 143 redaction requests. In particular, for calendar years 2012 through 2016, judicial officials' redaction requests accounted for, on average, 3.2 percent of the total financial disclosure reports filed during this time period. GAO requested copies of the annual redaction reports submitted to Congress for calendar years 2012 through 2016 and determined that AOUSC had not submitted the annual redaction reports to congressional committees of jurisdiction in a timely manner. Specifically, GAO found that AOUSC submitted the annual report covering 2012 in May 2014 and submitted four annual reports (for calendar years 2013 through 2016) in February and August of 2017, as shown in the table. For the 2013 and 2014 annual reports, AOUSC prepared and submitted them to the congressional committees of jurisdiction after GAO asked for them. AOUSC officials stated that they could not find evidence that they had submitted the annual reports for calendar years 2013 and 2014 to the committees of jurisdiction in a timely manner. However, AOUSC staff sent a 5-year report to congressional committees of jurisdiction in March 2017 that included information on redaction requests and results for calendar years 2012 through 2016. Thus, the congressional committees of jurisdiction had received no reports from AOUSC on redaction requests and results from May 2014 to February 2017. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Director of AOUSC develop and implement a formal process, with specified steps and associated time frames, to better ensure that required annual redaction reports are completed and submitted to Congress within the following year. AOUSC concurred with the recommendation and will determine how best to implement a more formalized process to better ensure it can submit annual redaction reports to Congress in a timely manner.",
    "gao_GAO-18-158": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy plans to spend over $267 billion (then-year dollars) to design and construct 12 submarines, including the Columbia class. The Columbia class class is comprised of several major lines of effort\u2014hull and supporting systems, the strategic weapons system, and the nuclear reactor-based propulsion plant\u2014which are managed by different program offices. The Navy expects to require over $267 billion (then-year dollars) in total life-cycle costs for the Columbia class program. GAO was asked to review the Columbia class program. This report examines (1) the status of key Columbia class technologies and congressional reporting requirements on this status, (2) risks, if any, with the Navy's planned approach for design and construction, and (3) whether expected funding levels for the Columbia class will be adequate moving forward. GAO reviewed program documentation and interviewed relevant officials. GAO also compared the Navy's current technology development plan and the planned technical approach with GAO's best practices for shipbuilding. What GAO Found The Navy's Columbia class program has not fully matured several key technical efforts as the Columbia class program moves into its design phase\u2014a practice counter to best practices GAO has previously identified. These efforts include the integrated power system, nuclear reactor, propulsor/coordinated stern, stern area system, and common missile compartment. While the Navy made progress in some areas\u2014such as prototyping efforts for the missile compartment and nuclear reactor\u2014all of these systems continue to require development and testing to mature them to the point at which GAO's technology readiness guide considers a technology mature. Any challenges in development could put the program at risk of costing more, taking longer to develop, or jeopardizing the program's ability to meet its expected performance requirements. However, the Navy identified only two of the submarine's technologies as \u201ccritical\u201d in the program's 2015 Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA), thereby underrepresenting the technology risk in the program. Underreporting technical risks can hinder Congress' and other decision makers' full understanding of the program's progress. This is especially important because the Navy has already requested $1.6 billion for advanced procurement and recently awarded the detail design contract. Moreover, there is no requirement that the Navy report to Congress on its progress in developing and testing the technologies until after the program completes its production readiness review in May 2020 after the Navy requests another $8.7 billion in funding for the construction of the lead submarine. The Navy is prioritizing design completion before starting construction, which is a good practice that is in accordance with GAO's work on best practices because it helps reduce cost and schedule challenges in construction. However, since some of the key technologies are not fully matured, detail design work is proceeding with notional or placeholder data representing these key systems. As a result, the design will likely remain immature once construction starts in fiscal year 2021. GAO has previously reported that concurrency of technology development and design increases the risk of design rework\u2014or having to make modifications to design drawings to accommodate any changes needed as a result of technologies changing size, shape, or weight as they mature\u2014and potentially can result in negative cost and schedule impacts. Further, the Navy faces an aggressive production schedule in order to deliver the lead submarine by fiscal year 2031, which will be required to prevent a gap in U.S. nuclear deterrent capabilities. The program office intends to mitigate this schedule challenge, in part, by starting construction of portions of the submarine earlier than initially planned. If this early construction occurs and the Navy does not alter design plans, construction of some parts of the lead submarine could outpace a finalized design for developing other components, which increases the risk of rework during construction and could further delay completion. GAO's analysis determined that it is more likely than not that the Columbia class program will exceed the Navy's $128 billion (then-year dollars) estimate of total acquisition cost to which the program will be funded. Specifically, the program's 2017 Milestone B cost estimates are optimistic because they do not account for a sufficient amount of program risk due to ongoing technology development, as well as the likely costs to design and construct the submarines. In addition, the Navy has budgeted the program to a confidence level for the program that is lower than what experts recommend, with a particularly optimistic estimate for the lead ship. While there may be situations when this would be appropriate, this is not the case for the Columbia class program due to the technical and design risks that GAO identified above. As a result, program costs will more likely than not exceed requested funding, particularly for lead ship construction. Due to the significant level of funding required for this program, even a small percentage of cost growth could have far-reaching consequences on the Navy'",
    "gao_GAO-18-137": "Why GAO Did This Study VA is responsible for addressing misconduct in its health care system, which includes about 316,800 employees. GAO was asked to review VA's disciplinary actions. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA collects misconduct and associated disciplinary-action data department-wide, and (2) the extent to which VA has procedures for investigating whistleblowers who have reported misconduct. GAO analyzed VA's misconduct and disciplinary-action data from calendar years 2010 through 2014, reviewed relevant VA policies and procedures, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found GAO identified 12 fragmented information systems that VA has used, or continues to use, to collect employee misconduct and associated disciplinary actions. Although VA has made efforts to develop repositories to collect information pertaining to misconduct and disciplinary actions, none of the 12 information systems contain complete information. Six of these systems collect partial misconduct and disciplinary action information and contain fields that could potentially be shared with other systems to obtain additional information, while the other six systems are intended for internal office use only, each containing their own unique fields and values tailored to the needs of that particular office, which are not shared. Therefore, the number of eligible fields for each information system was also limited to those not specifically designated for internal use. GAO's analysis of a generalizable sample of 544 misconduct case files (from a universe of 23,622 files) associated with disciplinary actions that affect pay from October 2009 through May 2015 revealed that VA officials did not consistently adhere to VA's policy for retaining files containing evidence of misconduct. Specifically, VA was unable to provide the files for 10 percent (55 of 544) of the files GAO requested. In addition, VA officials did not consistently adhere to VA's policy for documenting that procedures were followed in the adjudication of misconduct cases. GAO's review of 23 cases involving senior officials found that VA facility and program offices did not consistently follow policies and procedures established by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for investigating such allegations. In several instances, VA facility and program offices did not include one or more of the six elements required in their investigative response to allegations of misconduct. In addition, GAO's review of 23 cases found instances in which VA facility and program offices did not include sufficient documentation for their findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. In addition, GAO's review of the 23 cases found instances in which VA facility and program offices did not always provide supporting documentation for their findings, or provide a timely response to the OIG. GAO's review of VA's information systems that track misconduct involving senior officials department-wide indicates that they may not always be held accountable for misconduct. Specifically, (1) misconduct was sometimes substantiated, but the proposed disciplinary action was not taken; (2) misconduct was sometimes substantiated, but no disciplinary action was recommended; (3) previous penalties did not have the corrective effect for officials found to have engaged in repeated acts of misconduct and who have remained in VA management positions; and (4) senior officials violated separation-of-duty policy when taking disciplinary action. VA has procedures in place to ensure that allegations of misconduct are investigated, but these procedures allow VA program offices or facilities where a whistle-blower has reported misconduct to conduct the investigation. GAO's analysis of VA data shows that individuals who filed a disclosure of misconduct with the Office of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (OSC) received disciplinary action, and left the agency, at a higher rate than the peer average for the rest of VA. GAO's analysis of the 135 disclosure cases that were received by the OSC between calendar years 2010 and 2014 showed that 129 employees made a total of 130 disclosures nonanonymously. GAO's analysis did not confirm the reasons for disciplinary action or attrition involving any of the 129 employees who made nonanonymous disclosures to the OSC. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA develop and implement guidance to collect complete and reliable misconduct and associated disciplinary-action data department-wide, whether through a single information system, or multiple interoperable systems. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-46": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has a long-standing interest in developing innovative solutions to address global development challenges. In 2014, USAID established the Global Development Lab (the Lab) to provide technical assistance and support to USAID missions and bureaus. The Lab is headed by an Executive Director and includes five centers, offices, and Lab-Wide Priorities. GAO was asked to review the Lab. This report examines (1) the Lab's programs, funding, and staffing resources, (2) the extent to which the Lab has documented its oversight of awards with non-USAID contributions and clearly reported these contributions, and (3) the tools that the Lab uses to assess its performance as well as results that such assessments have shown. GAO reviewed relevant USAID guidance and documents, and interviewed USAID officials. GAO also reviewed 24 awards with non-USAID contributions from fiscal years 2014 through 2017 and reviewed the Lab's internal guidance for accounting for non-USAID contributions. What GAO Found The Global Development Lab (the Lab) aligns its programs with its strategic objectives, funding, and staffing. The Lab manages more than 25 programs and portfolios, which encompass projects and activities under a specific issue, aligned with the Lab's five strategic objectives. The programs focus on development research (science objective), digital development (technology objective), innovation ventures (innovation objective), and private-sector engagement (partnerships objective). The Lab's obligations of program funds have decreased over the past few fiscal years, from $170.7 million in fiscal year 2015 to $77 million in fiscal year 2017. Similarly, the Lab's obligations of program funds have also decreased since fiscal year 2015, according to Lab data. The number of staff in the Lab has decreased by over 30 percent from fiscal years 2015 through 2018, dropping from 224 in fiscal year 2015 to 155 in fiscal year 2018. The Lab consistently documented its oversight of awards with non-USAID contributions, but some data are outdated and public reporting lacks transparency. GAO's review of 24 awards with non-USAID contributions showed that the Lab consistently documented certain oversight requirements for non-USAID contributions (i.e., committed, rather than actual, contributions from the private sector, the public sector, and other U.S. government agencies). For all 24 awards, the Lab documented its compliance with key oversight requirements, such as reporting funding amounts committed from non-USAID sources; conducting valuations of in-kind contributions, as applicable; documenting partners met cost-share or matching funds, if required; and maintaining copies of the award agreement and any modifications. The Lab's internal guide to accounting for non-USAID contributions does not require its public reporting of data on non-USAID contributions to disclose the types of contributions represented. The Lab uses various tools to assess its performance, such as its results framework, portfolio reviews, strategic learning reviews, and evaluations. Because the Lab has existed only since 2014 and has had a strategy only since 2016, it has been able to collect a limited amount of data with which to assess its performance to show any trends in achieving results. However, the performance assessment tools that the Lab uses have identified both positive results and some weaknesses or challenges. For example, for one indicator\u2014the number of program or policy changes made by public sector, private sector, or other development actors that are influenced by Lab-funded research results or related scientific activities\u2014the Lab reported that it exceeded its target for both fiscal years. The Lab's portfolio reviews, strategic learning reviews, and evaluations, established by USAID policy or Lab-specific practices to assess its performance, have identified both positive results and some weaknesses or challenges. For example, for one indicator\u2014the number of program or policy changes made by public sector, private sector, or other development actors that are influenced by Lab-funded research results or related scientific activities\u2014the Lab reported that it exceeded its target for both fiscal years. The Lab's portfolio reviews also highlight, among other things, lessons learned and achievements made for particular projects and toward the Lab's overall strategic objectives and targets. The Lab's strategic learning reviews also note challenges faced Lab-wide as well as planned adjustments to address these challenges. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the USAID Administrator ensure that the Lab's internal guidance for accounting for non-USAID contributions includes instructions to update all non-USAID contributions data in the Lab's management information system at least annually. The USAID Administrator concurred with, and indicated that it is already addressing, both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-627": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars annually to acquire goods and services. In 2007, the Section 809 Panel\u2014a panel of federal acquisition officials\u2014issued a report that identified challenges facing the federal government in acquiring goods and services. The Panel recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) better align its acquisition, requirements, and budget processes. In addition, the Panel recommended that the General Services Administration (GSA) improve how agencies define requirements for service acquisitions. GAO was asked to review the Section 809 Panel's report. This report identifies actions the federal government has taken to address the key issues the Panel identified in its 2007 report, and some of the acquisition challenges that remain. GAO reviewed relevant acquisition guidance, analyzed federal procurement data, and interviewed officials from OMB, DOD, GSA, and the Small Business Administration (SBA). What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has struggled to adequately define requirements for its largest acquisition programs. For example, in 2014, GAO found that cost and schedule growth in major acquisition programs can, in part, be traced to a culture in which the military services begin programs with unrealistic requirements. This cost and schedule growth decreases DOD's buying power, reducing the aggregate military capability the department can deliver over time. In 2017, GAO found that the Army's requirements development workforce had decreased by 22 percent since 2008. GAO recommended that the Secretary of the Army conduct a comprehensive assessment to better understand the resources necessary for the requirements development process and determine the extent to which the shortfalls can be addressed given other funding priorities. While the Army agreed with the recommendation, it remains unaddressed. Several agencies have taken steps to improve how they define requirements for service acquisitions, and to focus more on contractors' deliverables than on how the contractors perform the work. However, some acquisition officials are reluctant to cede control of the acquisition to contractors. GAO has found that federal agencies have not consistently complied with requirements relating to key provisions from an information technology (IT) acquisition reform law. For example, GAO found that agencies have not consistently complied with requirements relating to requirements definition. In addition, GAO found that some agencies have not fully implemented certain requirements definition requirements as implemented by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). GAO has also found that agencies have not consistently complied with requirements relating to competition and pricing. For example, GAO found that some agencies did not leverage market research techniques on lower dollar contracts, and, as a result, may have missed opportunities to promote competition. GAO recommended that DOD take steps to amend acquisition regulations to incorporate a definition of bridge contracts, and, in the interim, provide guidance for agencies to track and manage their use. DOD agreed with the recommendation. GSA has developed new pricing tools, but is not collecting pricing data as it had planned. GSA officials told GAO that pricing data helps contracting officers conduct market research and negotiate prices. OFPP has promoted consolidated purchasing approaches to improve pricing, but low adoption rates diminish potential savings. The federal government has made significant progress addressing challenges related to interagency contracting, where one agency uses another's contract or contracting support to obtain goods or services. GAO has found that agencies' adoption of consolidated purchasing approaches has historically been low, and that tiered price discounts negotiated with vendors were not reached in most instances. GAO has found that agencies' adoption of strategic sourcing has historically been low, and that tiered price discounts negotiated with vendors were not reached in most instances.

    "gao_GAO-18-617": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a long-standing interest in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The Administration issued a plan for verification and monitoring in October 2015, and a plan for the 2017 update in October 2017. The NDAA required the President to include in the plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the verification and monitoring efforts. The NDAA also required GAO to review the plan. This report examines (1) the extent to which the plan addresses the reporting requirements and (2) the extent to which the plan addresses the reporting requirements. GAO reviewed the plan and interviewed NNSA officials. GAO also reviewed the plan and interviewed other agencies. What GAO Found The Administration's fiscal year 2018 plan for verification and monitoring described ongoing interagency efforts to support nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and includes information about relevant national priorities, capability gaps, research and development (R&D) initiatives, and roles and responsibilities. The 2018 plan (40 pages) is longer and more detailed than the 2015 plan (2 pages) or the 2017 update (4 pages). The bulk of the 2018 plan is contained in two chapters\u2014one chapter broadly describes U.S. and international efforts and roles and responsibilities, and the other chapter describes ongoing U.S. R&D efforts. The 2018 plan provided details on each of the four major reporting requirements called for in the fiscal year 2018 NDAA with the exception of future costs and funding needs. GAO found that the plan provided detail on verification, detection, and monitoring requirements and roles and responsibilities, but did not provide details on future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. For example, the plan identified requirements for verification, detection, and monitoring as required. The plan also described dozens of examples of R&D efforts and non-technical activities to address those technical gaps. GAO found that the plan did not identify costs and funding needs over a 10-year period. NNSA officials stated that they believed providing funding information over a 10-year period is unrealistic for several reasons. First, according to NNSA officials, it is not feasible to achieve agreement on actual or implied budgets outside of the existing President's budget process. Second, according to NNSA officials, long-term funding estimates are infeasible because the President's budget only identifies funding levels five years into the future. However, the 2018 NDAA did not ask for budget information. Instead, the NDAA reporting requirement called for long-term costs and funding information necessary to support the verification and monitoring activities in the plan.

    "gao_GAO-18-376": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2017, nearly 1.2 million children were placed in foster care. In fiscal year 2017, the number of children in foster care increased by over 10 percent. In fiscal year 2017, the number of children in foster care increased by over 10 percent. GAO was asked to review the recruitment and retention of foster families. This report examines (1) how state child welfare agencies recruit foster families, including those who provide therapeutic foster care services, (2) challenges, if any, to recruiting and retaining families, and (3) the extent to which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) supports child welfare agencies in their efforts to recruit and retain foster families. GAO surveyed state child welfare agencies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and interviewed officials from child welfare agencies, private providers, and foster parents in three selected states (California, Georgia, and Indiana). GAO also interviewed experts with a range of related research, policy, and direct service experience. What GAO Found States rely on a range of strategies to recruit foster families, including those who provide therapeutic foster care services. For example, child welfare officials in California said they contracted with a private provider who they also use to recruit and retain foster families to conduct these searches. In addition, child welfare officials and 14 private providers in the three selected states said they use community outreach, targeting certain populations, and obtaining referrals from current foster families. Nearly all states reported using private providers to recruit foster families, particularly those who can provide therapeutic foster care services. In the three selected states, child welfare officials said they initially developed agreements with private providers to recruit families who can provide therapeutic foster care services. However, as state caseloads have risen, these officials said they have also referred children who do not need therapeutic foster care services to private providers. In response to GAO's survey, 34 states reported that limited resources to focus on foster family recruitment made recruitment efforts moderately or very challenging. In the three selected states, child welfare officials raised concerns about their ability to prioritize recruitment efforts, given large increases in their foster care caseloads and other demands for resources. In addition, child welfare officials and 14 private providers in the three selected states said they have difficulty finding families who can meet the needs of children, particularly for therapeutic foster care services. In response to GAO's survey, 29 states reported that inadequate support for foster families from the child welfare agency made it moderately or very challenging to retain these families. In the three selected states, child welfare officials, private providers, and foster parents in all eight of the foster parent groups GAO spoke with emphasized the importance of supporting families in order to retain them. All 14 private providers GAO interviewed and foster parents in all eight of the foster parent groups GAO spoke with emphasized the importance of supporting families in order to retain them. All 14 private providers discussed concerns about communication with child welfare agencies, which they said can affect the quality of services they provide to foster families. In response to GAO's survey, 31 states reported that inadequate access to services, such as child care and transportation, made it moderately or very challenging to retain these families. In response to GAO's survey, many states reported that they found these federal supports helpful to their recruitment and retention efforts. For example, guidance and information, such as the electronic newsletters, publications, and webinars provided by the National Resource Center for Diligent Recruitment, were cited most often by states as being moderately or very helpful (31 states). However, similar to concerns raised by all 14 private providers in the three selected states about communication issues with child welfare agencies, several private providers told GAO they have not received guidance or information from these agencies about recruiting and retaining foster families, and most were unaware of some of the supports provided by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). Given the important role private providers play in recruiting and retaining foster families, state feedback to HHS on whether child welfare agencies could benefit from information on how to work more effectively with private providers could help HHS determine whether it needs to take action to better support states' use of private providers. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of HHS seek feedback from states on whether information on effective ways to work with private providers would be useful and if so, provide such information. HHS agreed with GAO's recommendation and said it will explore with states whether additional materials specific to private providers would be useful.",
    "gao_GAO-19-102": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's MHS provides health care to 9.4 million eligible individuals, including active duty personnel and their dependents. DOD's total workforce comprises three main components: military personnel (including active and reserve personnel), federal civilian personnel, and private sector contractor personnel. GAO was asked to review the MHS workforce. This report addresses the extent to which (1) the military departments' planning process for operational medical personnel requirements have assessed the mix of federal civilian, contractor, active and reserve medical personnel (i.e., workforce mix), and (2) the military departments determine the most appropriate workforce mix at MTFs and any challenges in executing an appropriate workforce mix. GAO analyzed DOD and department-level policies and guidance, and interviewed officials from the military departments, the military departments, and the DHA. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has not assessed the extent to which federal civilians and contractors can be used to meet identified operational medical personnel requirements. Specifically, the military departments generally consider only military personnel when conducting their planning processes to meet these requirements, and have not formally assessed the extent to which federal civilians and contractors could be utilized. Further, the departments do not generally consider the full cost of active and reserve component medical personnel when determining their balance of active and reserve component medical personnel, and they have not developed such information to use in their assessment of active and reserve balance. The military departments have taken actions, such as establishing policies and procedures, to aid the execution of the appropriate workforce mix for providing beneficiary health care within MTFs. However, the military departments face challenges in executing their plans in several areas, including lengthy hiring and contracting processes and uncompetitive salaries and compensation. Further, the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs from the military departments to the DHA may present challenges to the management of the military medical personnel. Specifically, the military departments and the DHA have not determined how military personnel will meet both the operational and beneficiary missions of the MHS after the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs to the DHA. Historically, each military department has been responsible for managing its military personnel to ensure it meets its operational mission and appropriately staffs its MTFs, and the challenge of balancing these missions was the responsibility of each respective military department. However, the transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs to the DHA will separate these missions\u2014the operational mission will be the responsibility of the military departments, and the beneficiary mission will be the responsibility of the DHA, with military personnel used to support both missions. The transfer of administrative responsibility for MTFs to the DHA represents an opportunity to reassess workforce mix at the MTFs. However, long-standing challenges in the management of federal civilian and contractor personnel, coupled with challenges related to the management of medical personnel after the transfer, could overshadow and cast doubt on the success of that reform. Without addressing the concerns GAO has highlighted, DOD may miss the opportunity presented by current transformation efforts in the MHS to ensure it has in place the most cost-effective mix of personnel in its workforce to accomplish its medical mission. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD assess the suitability of federal civilian and contractor personnel to provide operational medical care and incorporate the results of the assessment into relevant policies, if warranted. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-70": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid is the nation's largest health care financing program, with about $1.3 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2017. CMS is responsible for overseeing Medicaid, which includes about 1,400 data files, including an eligibility file and four claims files. T-MSIS is designed to capture significantly more data from states than is the case with MSIS, thereby collecting data not previously reported that should provide CMS and states with information to enhance their oversight efforts. GAO was asked to review the T-MSIS initiative. This report examines (1) the extent to which states are reporting T-MSIS data, and how CMS has supported states' efforts to report these data; and (2) the extent to which T-MSIS data are complete and comparable. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials and officials from eight states that were reporting T-MSIS data as of November 2017. GAO also interviewed officials from CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). What GAO Found Despite challenges converting state data to the Medicaid Management Information System (T-MSIS) format, most states were reporting T-MSIS data as of November 2017, representing significant progress over the past year. With most states reporting, CMS has shifted its efforts to working with states to improve the quality of T-MSIS data. For example, CMS created an online \"operational dashboard\" for each state, which provides specific information on errors in its reported data. CMS has also shifted its efforts to working with states to improve the quality of T-MSIS data. Ongoing data concerns raise questions about how soon\u2014and to what extent\u2014T-MSIS data will be sufficient to achieve the goals of improving CMS's and states' ability to use Medicaid data for oversight. For example, none of the six selected states that were reporting T-MSIS data as of August 2017 were reporting complete data at that time. In reviewing selected states' documentation of unreported data elements, GAO determined that the number of unreported data elements ranged from about 80 elements to 260 elements. Although T-MSIS includes about 1,400 data elements, the number of data elements relevant to each state varies, in part, because certain elements may not be applicable to all states and others may be populated at the state's discretion. In addition, the content of some data elements are present in more than one of the eight T-MSIS files. As a result, the number of unreported elements may overstate the extent of state efforts needed to report complete T-MSIS data. In some cases, data elements important for program oversight were not reported by two or more of the six selected states reporting T-MSIS data, limiting T-MSIS's usefulness for oversight in these areas. CMS has begun to take steps to address the quality of the T-MSIS data; however, its efforts are still evolving. For example, in May 2017, CMS identified 12 data quality priority areas for states to focus on for improving the accuracy and consistency of T-MSIS data, including accurately categorizing beneficiaries into T-MSIS eligibility groups and ensuring consistency related to MCO reporting. However, CMS has not yet fully articulated a plan for how and when it will use T-MSIS data for its own broader oversight efforts of state Medicaid programs. Absent such an effort, CMS is missing an opportunity to help states understand ways they could improve the quality of their T-MSIS data and facilitate states' use of the data for oversight. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS take additional steps to expedite the use of T-MSIS data for program oversight. In its written comments, HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-315": "Why GAO Did This Study Recovery housing\u2014which includes residential treatment centers and other residential treatment centers\u2014is a key step in the recovery process for individuals recovering from substance abuse and other substance use disorders (SUD). Research has shown positive outcomes of recovery housing on long-term sobriety, such as at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow up. GAO was asked to review the prevalence of recovery housing. This report examines (1) the prevalence of recovery housing in the United States and the extent to which states have investigated and overseeed such housing, and (2) the extent to which SAMHSA and state funding can be used for recovery housing. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from five states selected for their geographic diversity and experience with recovery housing. GAO also interviewed officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR)\u2014a national nonprofit organization that promotes standards for recovery housing\u2014and officials from NARR affiliates. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. HHS did not have any comments. What GAO Found The nationwide prevalence of recovery housing is unknown because there are no comprehensive data regarding the number of recovery homes in the United States, although NARR and Oxford House, Inc. collect data on a subset of recovery homes across the United States. Specifically, NARR collects data only on recovery homes that seek certification from one of its 15 state affiliates that certify homes. However, NARR-certified homes may represent only a portion of existing recovery homes, as NARR does not know how many such homes are uncertified. As of January 2018, NARR reported that its affiliates had certified almost 2,000 recovery homes, which had the capacity to provide housing to over 25,000 individuals. As of January 2018, NARR reported that its affiliates had certified almost 2,000 recovery homes, which had the capacity to provide housing to over 25,000 individuals. The five states GAO reviewed have taken actions to investigate and oversee recovery housing. Four of the five states have conducted law enforcement investigations of recovery housing in their states and some of these investigations have resulted in arrests and changes to public and private insurance policies. In addition to actions taken in response to state investigations, three of the five states in GAO's review have also taken steps to formally enhance their oversight of recovery homes, and the other two states have taken other steps intended to increase consistency, accountability, and quality across recovery homes. SAMHSA provides some funding for states to establish recovery housing. Of the five states GAO reviewed, two used SAMHSA funding and four used state funding to help support recovery housing from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. SAMHSA makes funding available to states for recovery housing through certain grant programs for SUD prevention and treatment. Specifically, under its Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant, which totaled approximately $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2017, SAMHSA makes at least $100,000 available annually to each state to provide loans for recovery housing. States that choose to use this funding may provide up to $4,000 in loans to each group that requests to establish alcohol- and drug-free housing for individuals recovering from SUD. The loan can be used for start-up costs such as security deposits and must be repaid within 2 years. SAMHSA has undertaken other initiatives related to recovery housing, including an assessment of needs for certifying recovery housing in the future. SAMHSA contracted with NARR at the end of fiscal year 2017 to provide technical assistance and training to recovery housing organizations, managers, and state officials on NARR's quality standards and certification process, including presentations at three to four national and regional SUD conferences, such as those held by the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors and other associations. SAMHSA officials told GAO that this is the agency's first contract with NARR, and SAMHSA plans to conduct an internal assessment at the end of fiscal year 2018 to determine next steps. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. HHS did not have any comments.",
    "gao_GAO-18-530": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for acquiring commercial items, such as aircraft, helicopters, and other items. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. This report examines (1) factors that influence DOD's commercial item and price reasonableness determinations and (2) the extent to which DOD has taken steps to make information available to help make these determinations. GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and DOD guidance; analyzed a non-generalizable sample of contracts awarded between 2010 and 2018 that met various criteria as case studies; and interviewed DOD officials and contractors. What GAO Found GAO found four interrelated factors that influenced how the Department of Defense (DOD) determines if an item is commercial and whether the price is fair and reasonable, and that each factor had its own set of challenges. For example, limited market information can complicate contracting officers' commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. For example, the Army was working with a contractor to acquire repair and upgrade services for navigation systems. The contractor said the services were commercial, but when the contracting officer conducted market research to determine the commerciality of the services, she found no similar services available in the commercial market. In contrast, for a previous report on commercial item acquisitions, GAO reviewed selected Air Force contracts for information technology services and video teleconferencing design and installation. Because these items and services are available in the commercial marketplace, the availability of information helped the contracting officers efficiently determine that the items were commercial and that the prices were fair and reasonable. Obtaining information from contractors and subcontractors can be challenging. For example, some contractors were unwilling to provide information, such as unredacted invoices, to them and therefore prime contractors cannot provide this information to the government. Despite these challenges, contract award was not typically delayed. In other cases where DOD was not able to obtain the information or data it needed to make a determination, the department's options, such as not awarding the contract or exploring other suppliers, were often not feasible because DOD was working in a sole-source environment and not procuring the item was not an option. DOD has taken steps to share more information across the department to inform commercial item and price reasonableness determinations, but efforts to date are in early stages of development or happening informally across the department. Despite these efforts, contracting officers still face challenges in obtaining adequate information to make informed commercial item and price reasonableness determinations, in part because no comprehensive information sharing strategy exists to outline responsibilities and funding of these efforts. DOD officials told GAO they plan to explore other options for the sharing of commercial item information, such as communities of practice, but have not made any formal plans. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD work with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) to develop a strategy for sharing information related to commerciality and price reasonableness determinations across DOD, including a plan to increase the information available in the Commercial Item alternative mechanisms to share information, either formal or informal; and assignments of roles and responsibilities with regard to sharing commercial item information, including how the database should be funded, supported, and maintained. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-151SP": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is a large and complex entity, with a wide range of policy objectives, programs, and activities. The federal government has a long history of analyzing the economic effects of its actions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued guidance on economic analysis, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued handbooks and guidance on economic analysis. GAO was asked to identify, for the purpose of developing GAO's assessment methodology for the review of an economic analysis, key methodological elements to the structure of an economic analysis that is intended to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of a public action. This report addresses the following objectives: (1) identifying, for the purpose of developing GAO's assessment methodology for the review of an economic analysis, key methodological elements to the structure of an economic analysis that is intended to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of a public action; and (2) identifying, for the purpose of developing GAO's assessment methodology for the review of an economic analysis, key methodological elements to the structure of an economic analysis that is intended to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about the economic effects of a public action. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed existing Circulars issued by the Office of Management and Budget, handbooks for economic analysis issued by federal agencies, international government agencies and institutions, and established textbooks on economic theory and benefit-cost analysis. GAO also solicited feedback from economics experts (in academia and public policy) and international audit agencies. GAO categorized these economic concepts across the key elements that GAO identified. GAO's assessment methodology for an economic analysis is based on the assessment of the individual key elements. GAO's assessment methodology has two steps: (1) an assessment of each individual key element and (2) an overall assessment based on the assessment of the individual key elements. GAO's assessment methodology typically considers all five key elements, but there may be cases, for example depending on the scope of an engagement, where it may consider only certain key elements. In those cases, GAO may not be able to make an overall assessment.

    "gao_GAO-18-363T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard has a demanding responsibility enforcing the Antideficiency Act, which requires the agency to implement a system to ensure that its health care services are provided to its nearly 50,000 military members. The Coast Guard has a long-standing interest in acquiring a new EHR system. The Coast Guard has begun to acquire a new EHR system, referred to as the Electronic Health Record Acquisition (eHRa). This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard has effectively managed and oversaw the IHiS project, (2) the challenges the Coast Guard has faced managing and maintaining paper health records, and (3) the extent to which the Coast Guard has begun to acquire a new EHR system. This statement is based on GAO's report being released today, which is being released today. What GAO Found The Coast Guard terminated the IHiS project in October 2015, after spending approximately $60 million on the project. The Coast Guard's Executive Oversight Council attributed IHiS termination to financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks. The Coast Guard ordered project management and contractor staff to cease work on IHiS until a determination was made regarding the antideficiency violation. The Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it effectively managed and oversaw the IHiS project prior to its discontinuance, and did not document and share valuable lessons learned from the failed project. Specifically, although the Coast Guard was to follow its System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Practice Manual to guide its management and oversight of the project, the agency could not provide complete evidence that it had addressed 15 of the 30 SDLC practices GAO selected for evaluation. For example, the Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it had conducted IHiS system testing, although the agency granted an authority to operate (ATO) and indicated in the ATO memorandum that the system had undergone some form of testing. The absence of the various documents and other artifacts that would support the required SDLC activities raises doubts that the Coast Guard took the necessary and appropriate steps to ensure effective management of the IHiS project. Further, although the Coast Guard developed charters for various governance boards to provide project oversight and direction, the boards were not active and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) was not included as a member as a member of the boards. Taking steps to fully implement governance boards that include the CIO will be important to the Coast Guard's oversight efforts in implementing a future EHR system and may decrease the risk of IT project failure. Lastly, although Coast Guard officials stated that lessons learned had been identified throughout the process of developing IHiS, as of 2 years after its cancelation, the agency had not documented and shared any lessons learned from the project and did not have established plans for doing so. Until the Coast Guard takes steps to document and share identified lessons learned with individuals charged with developing and acquiring its IT systems, opportunities to protect future systems against the recurrence of mistakes that contributed to the failure of IHiS will likely be missed. The Coast Guard is relying on a predominately paper health record management process to document health care services for its nearly 50,000 military members. Currently, clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. For example, clinical staff schedule appointments for patients using Microsoft Outlook's calendar feature and provide the patient with paper forms for completion upon his or her arrival. In addition, clinical staff must handwrite clinical notes in the paper health record during the appointment, as well as handwrite prescriptions, among other manual processes. In response to GAO's survey, the 12 HSWL Regional Managers identified a number of challenges that clinics and sick bays in their regions had experienced in managing and maintaining paper health records. These challenges were grouped into 16 categories. Further, the 120 clinic and sick bay administrators that subsequently responded to a separate survey reported varying degrees to which they viewed each category as challenging. With regard to these top four challenges to managing and maintaining paper health records, clinic and sick bay administrators described a range of alternative work-around processes that they have developed to help alleviate several of the challenges. However, these alternative processes may not provide sustained solutions to overcoming these challenges. Until Coast Guard implements a new EHR solution, the challenges inherent in a predominantly paper process will likely remain. The Coast Guard has begun taking steps to acquire a new EHR system, but has not yet Chosen a Solution. The Coast Guard formally identified the need for a new EHR system on February 1, 2016, and obtained approval for the first of three ADE's on February 13, 2016. It subsequently initiated market research activities by collecting cost, schedule, and capabilities information from commercial and government solution providers, including the",
    "gao_GAO-18-366": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government provides disaster assistance to help states and tribes recover from disasters. The President makes a declaration request for IA if the state or tribe has not implemented an emergency plan. FEMA's regional offices evaluate the request and make a regional recommendation through the Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR). GAO was asked to review the IA process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests made, declared, and denied by FEMA regions and the types of disasters for which IA declaration requests were received, and (2) the extent to which FEMA regions consider the six IA regulatory factors when evaluating states' and tribes' IA declaration requests. GAO analyzed FEMA's IA regulatory factors from calendar years 2008 through 2016 and interviewed FEMA officials in 10 FEMA regions and 11 states selected based on the number of IA declaration requests and the types of disasters for which declaration requests were received. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 IA declaration requests from calendar years 2008 through 2016. Of these, the President declared 168 requests (57 percent), and 51 percent of these declarations were from Regions IV and VI, as shown in the table below. Additionally, of the 126 IA declaration requests denied by the President, Regions X and IX had the highest percentage of denials, at 71 percent (10 out of 14) and 67 percent (12 out of 18), respectively, and Region I had the lowest percentage of denials at 13 percent (2 out of 15). FEMA obligated a total of approximately $8.6 billion in Individual Assistance (IA) for disaster declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016. These actual obligations were provided to 46 states and they ranged from less than $1 million to more than $1 billion. FEMA regions varied in how they considered the six IA regulatory factors when evaluating states' or tribes' IA declaration requests. FEMA's regional offices used the Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation to evaluate states' or tribes' IA declaration requests. Officials from the other 4 regions reported using five of the six factors, with the exception being the average amount of individual assistance by state factor. These officials noted that they do not use this factor because FEMA considers the factor to be outdated or they consider all of the factors holistically. Officials from FEMA's regional offices also generally reported that the extent to which they consider the six IA regulatory factors equally in all cases varies, depending on the circumstances of the related disaster. FEMA's regional offices did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the six IA regulatory factors. For example, all 81 RVARs developed by the 10 FEMA regions from July 2012 through December 2016 had at least some elements documented but not all for each of the six regulatory factors. For example, 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all of the six factors, 37 documented some but not all of the factors, and 51 documented some but not all of the factors. FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged that information related to all the elements for each of the six regulatory factors were missing from the RVARs. However, they also indicated that they do not fully know and have not evaluated all of the reasons why a region may have omitted information on an element of a factor. FEMA headquarters officials agreed that having complete information on all elements of the regulatory factors in the RVARs would assist in their recommendation process. Because it is unclear why regions are not completely documenting all elements related to the current six regulatory factors, such an evaluation could help FEMA identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Doing so could help FEMA ensure it is achieving its stated goals in providing consistency in the evaluation process and in the types of factors it considers. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendations for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. DHS concurred with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-143": "Why GAO Did This Study FEMA is responsible for assisting states in rebuilding after disasters. FEMA's PA program provides grants to states to help them rebuild after disasters. GAO has previously reported on challenges in processing PA appeals. GAO was asked to review FEMA's management of the PA appeals process. This report examines (1) the extent to which FEMA ensures quality in its data on appeals and what FEMA data show about its appeals inventory and timeliness for appeals decisions; (2) what steps FEMA has taken to improve its management of the appeals process and what challenges, if any, remain; and (3) the extent to which FEMA has developed goals and measures to assess the performance of the PA appeals program. GAO analyzed FEMA data on all first- and second-level appeals that FEMA received between January 2014 and July 2017, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed FEMA officials. What GAO Found GAO's review of FEMA data that track first- and second-level appeals showed weaknesses in the agency's data quality practices that affect program oversight. For example, GAO found that FEMA regional offices do not consistently or update first-level appeals data consistently or update this data regularly, resulting in missing data entries. Further, GAO found that FEMA's appeal tracking process does not ensure data quality, limiting FEMA's ability to use the data for making decisions on and improvements to the PA appeals process. During GAO's review, FEMA officials acknowledged the discrepancies GAO found with these appeals data. FEMA officials acknowledged these data quality issues and provided GAO with corrected data to address these discrepancies for GAO's analysis in this report. GAO's analysis of the corrected FEMA data showed that, between January 2014 and July 2017, FEMA received over 1,400 first- and second-level appeals with amounts in dispute totaling about $1.5 billion. Across all years, first-level appeals accounted for the majority of appeals, though the number of appeals fluctuated widely each year. Over the same period, only a small percentage of first- and second-level appeals were processed within the 90-day statutory time frame. FEMA has taken a number of steps to improve its management of the PA appeals process and respond to issues raised by GAO and the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General (OIG) related to processing delays, staff independence, and communications with applicants. For example, FEMA created the PA appeals board within the Recovery Directorate at FEMA headquarters in 2013. FEMA also took steps to increase its staffing levels. For example, FEMA took nearly 2 years to fill the additional appeals analyst positions across its 10 regional offices. However, FEMA has not developed a workforce staffing plan to identify hiring, training, and retention needs of appeals staff across PAAB and the regional offices. FEMA officials told GAO that they are still working to achieve the staffing levels developed in 2015 and are taking steps to address staffing challenges related to retention through more targeted hiring and use of career ladder positions. In the absence of a workforce plan for the PA appeals staff, FEMA will likely continue to experience workforce challenges including vacancies in key appeals analyst positions, appeals staff turnover, training delays, and understaffing due to disaster deployment. These challenges will likely continue to contribute to delays in FEMA's processing and issuing first- and second-level PA appeals decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FEMA (1) design and implement the necessary processes and procedures to ensure a uniform and consistent approach for tracking first-level appeals data; (2) develop a detailed workforce plan for hiring, training, and retaining key appeals staff; and (3) work with regional administrators to establish and use performance goals and measures for processing first-level PA appeals to monitor performance and report on progress. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-105": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies rely extensively on information systems to carry out their missions. In addition, the federal government has a long-standing interest in securing federal information systems. In 2015, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 included a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the federal government's approach and strategy for securing agency information systems, including intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. This report assesses (1) the reported effectiveness of selected agencies' implementation of the federal government's approach and strategy to securing agency information systems; (2) the extent to which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency information systems; and (3) the extent to which selected agencies reported implementing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also interviewed DHS and OMB officials. What GAO Found According to inspectors general, agency chief information officers (CIO), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports on federal information security practices, many agencies were not effectively implementing the federal government's approach and strategy to securing information systems as of fiscal year 2017. For example, the inspectors general for 17 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported that their agencies had not effectively implemented their information security programs and had significant information security deficiencies associated with internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the CIOs demonstrated that, during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, most agencies had not met all targets for the cybersecurity cross-agency priority goal for improving cybersecurity performance. Further, based on FISMA metrics reported for fiscal year 2017, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing risks to their enterprise, while the other 10 agencies were at risk of ineffectively identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and if necessary, recovering from cyber intrusions. DHS and OMB, as required by law and policy, have taken various actions to facilitate the agencies' use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency systems. For example, DHS has developed an intrusion assessment plan, deployed the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) to offer intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to agencies, and is providing tools and services to agencies to monitor their networks through its Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. However, NCPS still had limitations in detecting certain types of traffic and agencies were not sending all appropriate traffic through the system. Further, CDM was behind at meeting planned implementation dates, and agencies have requested additional training and guidance for these services. OMB has taken steps to improve upon agencies' capabilities, but has not completed a policy and strategy to do so, or fully reported on its assessment of agencies' capabilities. OMB has taken steps to improve upon agencies' capabilities, but has not completed a policy and strategy to do so, or fully reported on its assessment of agencies' capabilities. Until OMB completes a policy and strategy to do so, it will continue to be remiss in providing timely and sufficiently detailed information to congressional stakeholders to support their oversight responsibilities. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB (1) complete a policy and strategy to do so, and (2) work with DHS to follow up with agencies to identify obstacles and impediments affecting their abilities to implement intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. OMB and DHS concurred with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-162": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's unmanned systems are critical to the Navy's and Marine Corps' ability to conduct a wide range of military operations. The Navy and Marine Corps are in the process of rapidly growing their portfolios of unmanned systems, but have not evaluated the use of alternative workforces\u2014specifically the use of federal civilian employees and private sector contractors as unmanned system operators. GAO was asked to review the Navy's and Marine Corps' workforce planning. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Navy and Marine Corps have developed personnel requirements for selected unmanned systems and (2) the extent to which the services have developed staffing approaches for unmanned system operators. GAO reviewed Navy and Marine Corps workforce planning documents and interviewed Navy and Marine Corps officials. GAO also held eight case studies of eight selected unmanned systems. What GAO Found The Navy and the Marine Corps are in the process of rapidly growing their portfolios of unmanned systems, but have not evaluated the use of alternative workforces\u2014specifically the use of federal civilian employees and private sector contractors as unmanned system operators. The Navy and the Marine Corps have not evaluated the use of alternative workforces\u2014specifically the use of federal civilian employees and private sector contractors\u2014for unmanned system operators. The Navy and the Marine Corps have identified personnel requirements for three systems, but the sufficiency of requirements for four other systems is yet undetermined. The Navy and the Marine Corps have not updated personnel requirements and the related cost estimate for the RQ-21 Blackjack Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) based on deployment data. Without updating the cost estimate as appropriate after updating personnel requirements, the Navy and the Marine Corps may not have current information about the Marine Corps' RQ-21 Blackjack UAS lifecycle cost and affordability. The Department of the Navy has made some positive steps but has not fully evaluated and updated its aviation policies for operation and maintenance of certain UAS to inform the development of future personnel requirements. For example, the Navy has taken a preliminary step to further evaluate what policy changes may be needed to support unmanned systems by establishing an advisor position for this purpose within the Naval Innovation Advisory Council. However, the time frames for making such policy changes have not been identified. Unless the Navy and the Marine Corps prioritize updating policies for operating and maintaining UAS of different sizes and capabilities they may miss opportunities to effectively and efficiently use personnel resources as system inventories grow. The Navy and the Marine Corps have developed staffing approaches to select, train, and track unmanned systems operators and to retain some UAS operators by offering special and incentive pays. However, both services face challenges in ensuring that there are sufficient UAS operators to meet personnel requirements. For example, the Marine Corps has experienced past shortfalls of UAS operators through fiscal year 2017. The Marine Corps has leveraged lateral personnel transfers from other occupations to meet approximately 33 to 89 percent of its yearly retention quotas for first-term UAS operator reenlistments since fiscal year 2010. However, the Marine Corps has not fully explored the use of human capital flexibilities to address these workforce challenges. Without exploring these or other human capital flexibilities to improve morale and career satisfaction and maximize operators' availability to squadrons, the Marine Corps may continue to face challenges in meeting requirements and growing operational demands. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Navy and Marine Corps (1) clarify workforce planning policies to identify circumstances in which federal civilian employees and private sector contractors may serve in operational roles and (2) apply the revised policies to evaluate the use of all personnel resources available to them for future unmanned systems. DOD concurred with eight of GAO's recommendations and partially concurred with two recommendations.",

Reclamation has awarded grants to help build, construct, and use water reuse facilities, such as pipelines and treatment plants. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) authorized an additional $50 million to be appropriated for water reuse projects. GAO was asked to review the Title XVI program. This report examines (1) the amount of funding Reclamation has awarded under the Title XVI program and the status of projects and studies, and (2) the extent to which Reclamation's process for selecting projects and studies to award grants under the Title XVI program is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials and project sponsors. GAO also reviewed federal grant regulations and interviewed project sponsors and representatives from nongovernmental water reuse organizations. What GAO Found From fiscal years 1992 through 2017, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) awarded about $715 million for 46 construction projects and 71 studies under the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program (Title XVI). Most of this funding\u2014about $703 million\u2014went toward construction projects, while the remaining awards were for feasibility and research studies. Some construction projects remain eligible for Title XVI grants. Specifically, about $464 million in grant funding not yet awarded up to the federal ceiling remains for individually congressionally authorized Title XVI construction projects, and about $513 million remains in total estimated projects eligible for Title XVI grants under the WIIN Act, as of August 2018. Title XVI projects and studies for fiscal years 1992 through 2017 cover various uses for reused water and include both urban and rural areas throughout the West, based on GAO's review of agency data as well as documents from and interviews with project sponsors. For example, Title XVI construction projects produce both nonpotable and potable reused water for a variety of purposes, such as landscape irrigation, agricultural irrigation, commercial and industrial use, and habitat restoration. Reclamation's process for selecting projects and studies to award grants under the Title XVI program involves announcing the funding opportunity, establishing criteria to evaluate potential projects, and reviewing applications to make award decisions. GAO found that this process is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations outlined in Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Guidance, based on GAO's review of agency documents and federal grant regulations. Reclamation's process for monitoring Title XVI grants is consistent with relevant federal grant regulations, based on GAO's review of agency documents and federal grant regulations. Reclamation reviews financial and performance reports submitted by project sponsors, regularly communicates and visits with project sponsors to obtain information on the status of the projects, and collects information on the amount of water Title XVI projects deliver each year, which is included in Interior's annual performance report. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-17-783T": "Why GAO Did This Study The FBI operates in an array of buildings, including the Hoover Building, which was designed at a time when the FBI operated differently, and it cannot be redeveloped to provide the necessary space to consolidate the FBI Headquarters components or to meet the agency's current and projected operational requirements. GAO has previously reported that the FBI's headquarters facilities did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. GAO was asked to testify on its recent report on the FBI's headquarters facilities. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which the FBI's headquarters facilities support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements, and (2) the extent to which the General Services Administration (GSA) has successfully completed recent swap exchanges. This statement is based on GAO's 2014 report, which examined the FBI's headquarters facilities and alternative funding mechanisms. GAO also reviewed GSA's recent swap exchanges. What GAO Found In 2011, GAO reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) headquarters facilities did not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space, and building condition requirements. In 2011, GAO reported that the FBI's original design is inefficient, according to GSA assessments, making it difficult to reconfigure space to promote staff collaboration. In 2011, GAO recommended that GSA evaluate its strategy to minimize major repair and recapitalization investments and take action to address any facility condition issues that could put FBI operations at risk and lead to further deterioration of the building. In July 2017, GSA and FBI officials stated that they cancelled the procurement for the new FBI headquarters consolidation project, noting that the there was a lack of funding necessary to complete the procurement. GSA officials stated that the swap exchange approach can help GSA address the challenges of disposing of unneeded property and modernizing or replacing federal buildings. GSA officials stated that swap exchanges can help GSA facilitate construction projects given a growing need to modernize and replace federal properties, shrinking federal budgets, and challenges obtaining funding. Specifically, GSA officials noted that swap exchanges allow GSA to immediately apply the value of a federal property to be used in the exchange to construction needs, rather than attempting to obtain funds through the appropriations process. In 2014, GAO reported that GSA had only completed transactions using the swap exchange authority for two small (under $10-million each) swap exchanges completed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2001 and in San Antonio, Texas, in 2012. Furthermore, GSA has faced a number of obstacles in its use of this authority. For example, for GAO's 2014 report, GSA solicited market interest in exchanging almost 8-million square feet in federal property for construction services or newly constructed assets. However, GSA chose not to pursue swap exchanges in all five of these projects, including the proposed FBI headquarters consolidation project. GSA officials stated they planned to improve the swap exchange process, including the property appraisal process, outreach to stakeholders to identify potential project risks for future projects, and to the extent possible, mitigate such risks. However, GAO also reported that several factors may continue to limit the applicability of the agency's approach. Specifically, the viability of swap exchanges may be affected by specific market factors, such as the availability of alternative properties. In addition, the specific valuation approach used by appraisers or potential investors may reduce the viability of the swap exchange.

    "gao_GAO-18-273": "Why GAO Did This Study JWST is a complex, multibillion dollar project to replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. JWST is to be launched in October 2018. The project is a complex undertaking that includes integrating and testing the telescope and spacecraft, and integrating and testing the spacecraft and spacecraft. GAO has previously reported that JWST has experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. GAO was asked to review the project. This report examines (1) the extent to which the project has made progress in integrating and testing the telescope and spacecraft, and (2) the extent to which the contractor has maintained higher than planned workforce levels to address continuing technical challenges. GAO reviewed JWST documentation and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. What GAO Found The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project has made considerable progress toward completing its third and fourth of five total integration and test phases for the combined optical telescope element and integrated science instrument module (OTIS) and the spacecraft elements, respectively. Previously, the project and Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop Grumman) completed the integration phases in March 2016. However, the project and Northrop Grumman have not yet completed the integration and test phases for the spacecraft element and the spacecraft elements, respectively. In September 2017, the JWST project requested a launch window at least 5 to 8 months later than the planned October 2018 launch readiness date, based on the results of a schedule risk assessment that showed that various components of the spacecraft element integration were taking longer to complete than expected. The new launch window included up to 4 months of additional schedule reserves. However, shortly after requesting the revised launch window from the European Space Agency, which will contribute the launch vehicle, the project learned from Northrop Grumman that up to another 3 months of schedule reserve use was expected, due to lessons learned from conducting deployment exercises of the spacecraft element and sunshield. After incorporating some schedule efficiencies, the project now has 1.5 months of schedule reserve remaining. Given the remaining integration and test work ahead\u2014the phase in development where problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip\u2014and risks remaining to be reduced to acceptable levels, coupled with a low level of schedule reserves, GAO believes that additional delays to the project's launch readiness date are likely. The contractor continued to maintain higher than planned workforce levels in the past year and, as a result, NASA will have limited cost reserves to address future challenges. For the past 44 months, Northrop Grumman's actual workforce has exceeded its projections and the company is not expected to significantly reduce its workforce until the spring of 2019, when NASA plans to ship the completed observatory to the launch site. Northrop Grumman had planned to reduce its workforce in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as work was planned to be completed, but has needed to maintain higher workforce levels due to technical challenges and the work taking longer than expected. Projections made at the beginning of fiscal year 2017\u2014when the expected launch readiness date was October 2018\u2014expected workforce levels to begin at 472 full-time equivalent staff and drop to 109 at the end of the fiscal year. However, technical challenges and delays in completing scheduled work did not allow for the planned workforce reduction and Northrop Grumman reported 496 full-time equivalent staff in September 2017, or 387 more than planned. According to JWST project officials and similar to previous years, Northrop Grumman's priority for fiscal year 2018 is to maintain schedule in order to ensure that the new launch window set from March to June 2019 can be met. As a result, Northrop Grumman's contractor workforce levels are expected to continue to be elevated through JWST's final integration and test phase in fiscal year 2019 where the spacecraft and OTIS will be integrated before shipment to the launch site. The project continues to identify funding options in the event of a delay of beyond the end of the launch window. Under the 2011 replan, Congress placed an $8 billion cap on formulation and development costs, but any long delays beyond the new launch window\u2014which, as noted above, are likely\u2014place the project at risk of exceeding this cap.

    "gao_GAO-18-611T": "Why GAO Did This Study The SFSP, a federal program that provides meals to children in areas experiencing crime or violence, is the nation's largest nutrition assistance program for low-income children. The program is administered by FNS, which is required to annually submit certain reports to Congress. This testimony discusses (1) the number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer, (2) the extent to which other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) the challenges states and SFSP providers reported with the SFSP. This statement is based on GAO's May 2018 report, which examined (1) the number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer, (2) the extent to which other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) the challenges states and SFSP providers reported with the SFSP. GAO reviewed FNS data and interviewed FNS officials and state and SFSP providers. What GAO Found The total number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer\u2014one indicator of program participation\u2014increased from 113 million meals in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32 percent. Although almost half of the total increase in meals served in the summer months was due to increases in lunches, when comparing across each of the meal types, supper and breakfast had the largest percentage increases over the 10-year period, 50 and 48 percent, respectively. The increase in SFSP meals over this time period was generally consistent with increases in the number of meals served in the National School Lunch Program, the largest child nutrition assistance program, during this period. Although states reported the actual number of SFSP meals served to FNS for reimbursement purposes, they estimated the number of children participating in SFSP, and these participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently, impairing FNS's ability to inform program implementation and facilitate strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. Specifically, states calculated a statewide estimate of children's participation in the SFSP, referred to as average daily attendance (ADA), using sponsor-reported information on the number of meals served and days of operation in July of each year. However, according to GAO's review of states' survey responses and FNS documents, states' methods for calculating ADA have differed from state to state and from year to year. For example, although FNS directed states to include the number of meals served in each site's primary meal service\u2014which may or may not be lunch\u2014some states calculated ADA using only meals served at lunch. In addition, five states reported in GAO's survey that the method they used to calculate ADA in fiscal year 2016 differed from the one they used previously. While FNS clarified its instructions in May 2017 to help improve the consistency of states' ADA calculations moving forward, ADA, even if consistently calculated, remained an unreliable estimate of children's daily participation in SFSP because it did not account for state variation in the month with the greatest number of SFSP meals served. FNS officials stated in a May 2017 memo to states that it is critical that the agency's means of estimating children's participation in the SFSP is as accurate as possible because it helps inform program implementation at the national level and facilitates strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. Yet, at the time of GAO's May 2018 report, FNS had not yet taken further action to improve the estimate. Other federal and nonfederal programs that operate solely in the summer, as well as those operating year-round, helped feed low-income children in the summer months. For example, in 2016, FNS data indicated about 26 million meals were served through the National School Lunch Program's Seamless Summer Option, a separate federal program that streamlines administrative requirements for school meal providers serving summer meals. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by entities such as faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though the reach of these efforts was limited. States and SFSP providers reported challenges with issues related to meal site availability, children's participation, and program administration, though federal, state, and local entities had taken steps to improve these areas. For example, a lack of available transportation, low population density, and limited meal sites posed challenges for SFSP implementation in rural areas, according to states GAO surveyed, selected national organizations, and state and local officials in the three states GAO visited. In response, state and local entities took steps, such as transporting meals to children by bus, to address these issues\u2014efforts that FNS supported through information sharing and grants. States and SFSP providers also reported challenges with meal site safety, and FNS's efforts to address",
    "gao_GAO-18-114": "Why GAO Did This Study The growth of e-commerce has greatly increased the likelihood of businesses selling to out-of-state customers. In 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a state can only require a business to collect and remit sales tax if the business has substantial presence (referred to as nexus) in that state. However, the decision stated that Congress could pass legislation to overrule the Quill decision. GAO was asked to review the potential revenue gains that state and local governments could gain by being able to collect taxes on sales made by all remote sellers. This report addresses (1) the extent to which state and local governments can collect taxes on sales made by all remote sellers, (2) the costs that businesses would incur if they were required to collect taxes on all remote sales, and (3) strategies that could mitigate these costs. GAO analyzed sales tax data from the U.S. Census Bureau, reviewed tax literature, and interviewed tax practitioners, tax policy specialists, and representatives from the business community. What GAO Found GAO estimates that state and local governments can, under current law, require remote sellers to collect about 75 to 80 percent of the taxes that would be owed if all remote sellers were required to collect tax on all remote sales at current rates. GAO found that the percentage of taxes already being collected by sellers (which GAO calls the \"seller collection rate\") was generally higher for Internet retailers than for other types of remote sellers like catalog retailers or e-marketplaces. GAO estimates that the percentage of taxes already being collected by sellers (which GAO calls the \"seller collection rate\") was generally higher for Internet retailers than for other types of remote sellers like catalog retailers or e-marketplaces.

GAO estimates that the percentage of taxes already being collected by sellers (which GAO calls the \"seller collection rate\") was generally higher for Internet retailers than for other types of remote sellers like catalog retailers or e-marketplaces. GAO estimates that the potential revenue gains to state and local governments could potentially be about $8 billion based on GAO's low scenario to about $13 billion, based on GAO's high scenario, in 2017 if they were given expanded authority to require sales tax collection from all remote sellers. GAO found that the extent to which state and local governments can require remote sellers to collect taxes varies by state. Based on analyses of remote sellers' nexus locations, GAO estimates that some of the largest states (in terms of population) can currently require sellers to collect about 80 to 90 percent of the taxes these states could collect with expanded authority on all remote sales. In contrast, GAO estimates that some smaller states can only require sellers to collect and remit about 60 to 70 percent of the taxes they could collect on all remote sales. GAO identified various costs associated with typical steps involved in multistate sales tax collection. GAO group these costs into three broad categories: software related costs, audit and assessment compliance costs, and costs associated with research and liability. GAO found that businesses with limited experience in multistate tax collection and those that lack software systems designed to facilitate multistate tax collection would incur the highest costs under such a scenario. Businesses with limited experience in multistate tax collection and those that lack software systems designed to facilitate multistate tax collection would incur the highest costs under such a scenario. GAO identified strategies with the potential to mitigate the concerns laid out above, but much would depend on the specifics of any legal changes. These strategies include: simplification rules for collection and remittance in multiple states, small business exemptions for businesses under a certain size, transition periods for businesses to come into compliance, and limitations on lookback periods.",
    "gao_GAO-18-226": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the military selective service process. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD included information on the six required reporting elements in its report and (2) the extent to which DOD provided additional information that may be useful for the ongoing review of the military selective service process by the Commission. GAO reviewed DOD's report and interviewed DOD officials and selected military service officials. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) included information on each of the six required reporting elements in its July 2017 report to Congress and the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service on the purpose and utility of a registration system for military selective service. In preparing the report, officials within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that they coordinated and consulted with subject matter experts at the Selective Service System and the Joint Staff as well as with officials from selected organizations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, including the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command. Further, the DOD report references internal DOD documents, a policy publication from the Congressional Research Service regarding Selective Service issues, statements from former DOD executives, and publications from contributing authors on web-based foreign policy and national security discussion sites for additional support. While DOD included information on the six required reporting elements in its report, GAO identified additional information that may be useful in supporting the ongoing review of the military selective service process by the Commission. Specifically, based on GAO's review of DOD's report and GAO's prior work, the Commission could benefit from additional information on (1) DOD's requirements and timelines for the induction of individuals into the military services who are selected through a draft, and (2) the perspectives of the military services on the military selective service processes. For example, one of the six required reporting elements in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to provide a detailed analysis of its personnel needs in the event of an emergency requiring a mass mobilization, along with a timeline for obtaining these inductees. In response, DOD provided the personnel requirements and a timeline that was developed in 1994 and that have not been updated since. These requirements state that, in the event of a draft, the first inductees are to report to a Military Entrance Processing Station in 193 days and the first 100,000 inductees would report for service in 210 days. DOD officials stated that the personnel requirements and timeline developed in 1994 are still considered realistic. Thus, they did not conduct any additional analysis to update the plans, personnel requirements, or timelines for responding to an emergency requiring mass mobilization. Further, the military service officials that GAO met with told GAO that their perspectives on the selective service processes that would affect them had not been solicited in the preparation of DOD's report. For example, while the military services are responsible for training inductees upon their mobilization and integrating them into the force, service officials expressed concerns to GAO regarding whether, for example, they would have the training facilities, uniforms or funding to receive, train, equip, and integrate a large influx of inductees in the event of a draft. Additionally, the services are expected to provide support to the Selective Service System during a national emergency. A 1997 memorandum of understanding between the Selective Service System and DOD indicates, among other things, that the Department of the Army will provide 1,500 enlisted Army retirees to augment the Selective Service System within 72 hours after a draft is initiated. However, Army officials told GAO that they believed some of their service-specific procedures might require updates identifying individuals to augment the Selective Service System's staff, especially the retired personnel that would need to be recalled to duty. They thought it would be beneficial for officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to conduct a thorough, top-down review and lead an update of service instructions related to supporting a draft to ensure the services are prepared to provide their share of personnel if needed. These officials stated that they did not incorporate information from the military services into their report because DOD's involvement in any potential decision to initiate and implement a draft is mostly centralized within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, not within the individual military services.

    "gao_GAO-18-102": "Why GAO Did This Study Water utilities provide drinking water and wastewater services, including drinking water treatment and distribution and wastewater collection, treatment, and discharge. Water utilities employ a broad range of workers, including water operators; engineers; customer service representatives; accountants; legal support; and skilled technical occupations, such as electricians, machinists, and instrument technicians. GAO was asked to review workforce needs at water utilities. This report examines (1) what is known about workforce needs at water utilities compared with workforce needs nationwide and any effects of potential unmet workforce needs on the utilities' abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act; (2) what approaches selected water utilities have used to manage their workforce needs and challenges they have faced in managing those needs; and (3) in what ways, if any, key federal programs can assist water utilities with their workforce needs. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, analyzed workforce projections from the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), interviewed officials from selected water utilities, and reviewed agency documents. What GAO Found Data available from BLS suggest that the replacement needs for water operators are similar to workforce replacement needs nationwide across all occupations. However, little information is available about the current and future effects of any unmet workforce needs on utilities' abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. BLS projects that there will be an annual average of 9,200 job openings for water operators between 2016 and 2026. It also projects a slight decline in overall employment for water operators because of increasing automation at water utilities; this decline contrasts with total employment across all occupations, which is projected to increase by an annual average of 1,151,850 jobs. Little is known about whether unmet workforce needs are affecting water utilities' overall abilities to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. At a national level, neither the water utilities' industry associations nor EPA has analyzed whether there is a relationship between unmet workforce needs and compliance problems. Some water utility industry associations have analyzed projected employee retirement eligibility and employee turnover, but these studies did not analyze the potential effect of these retirements on utilities' operations. Similarly, the American Water Works Association's annual benchmarking surveys collect data on utilities' water and wastewater regulatory compliance rates; however, the association does not analyze whether there is a relationship between retirement eligibility and regulatory compliance. Water utilities and industry associations have some planned and ongoing work to learn more about workforce needs at water utilities. For example, representatives from one of the selected large utilities that GAO interviewed told GAO that a group of 16 large water utilities are informally working together to address workforce challenges and have proposed a major applied research project with the objectives of (1) exploring in greater depth the specific occupations, skills, and career pathways that can bridge the water sector's looming employment gap; (2) clarifying the range of water jobs available at a regional level; (3) identifying the potential pools of labor to fill these positions; and (4) exploring new development strategies to equip workers with the skills they need. Representatives from selected utilities that GAO interviewed reported using a mix of various approaches to manage their workforce needs, but the selected large utilities reported ongoing challenges hiring water operators and other skilled workers. The representatives of the selected utilities reported that they used some of the approaches to varying degrees, but none of these representatives reported using all of them. The representatives of the selected large utilities reported ongoing challenges hiring water operators and other skilled workers. The representatives of the selected large utilities reported ongoing challenges hiring water operators and other skilled workers. The five federal agencies GAO reviewed\u2014EPA, USDA, Education, DOL, and VA\u2014have programs that can assist utilities with their workforce needs in several ways, including through guidance, funding, and training. For example, EPA has several programs that can provide funding, through the states, for technical assistance to help water utilities meet their workforce needs. For example, EPA's national Training and Technical Assistance for Small Systems competitive grant provides, on average, $12 million per year to give managerial and financial training to utilities, particularly small utilities. In addition, EPA has assisted in efforts to attract new employees to the drinking water and wastewater industry. For example, EPA partnered with the American Water Works Association and the Water Environment Federation to highlight the need for qualified professionals to enter the drinking water and wastewater industry. EPA has also collaborated with DOL, USDA, and VA to assist drinking water and wastewater utilities in meeting their workforce replacement needs. For example, EPA has worked with DOL and industry groups to develop a competency model for the water sector, which was updated in 2016. EPA has also entered into memorandums of understanding with USDA and VA to assist drinking water and wastewater utilities in meeting their workforce replacement needs.

    "gao_GAO-18-592": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD provides a wide range of services and supplies to its customers, including intelligence, human resources, and secure networks. DOD's DAFAs provide a variety of services and supplies to its customers, including intelligence, human resources, secure networks, and weapons systems. GAO was asked to review DOD's DAFAs. This report evaluates the extent to which (1) DOD has assessed the continuing need for each DAFA; (2) any overlap or fragmentation among the DAFAs that provide human resources services has affected the delivery of those services; and (3) DOD has monitored and evaluated the results of its efficiency initiatives that affect the DAFAs. GAO reviewed DOD's biennial reports on the DAFAs from 1987, the first year after enactment of the requirement, through 2012, the most recent year of DOD's reporting. GAO also reviewed the business functions of selected DAFAs to identify possible inefficient duplication, overlap, or fragmentation in the services provided by those selected DAFAs to other organizations within the department. GAO analyzed DOD's biennial reports and combat support agency reports against key elements of quality evaluations, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has not comprehensively or routinely assessed the continuing need for its Defense Agency and Defense Field Activity (DAFA) that provide human resources services to other defense organizations. From 1987 to 2012, DOD issued biennial reports to Congress to record its response to this statute, but the methodology and quality of those reports varied. Regarding the methodology of the past reports, from 1987 to 1995, DOD relied on a research team to identify findings and provide recommendations on the structure and composition of the DAFAs. From 2005 to 2010, DOD issued three reports that alternated between a senior management assessment of the DAFAs and the customer survey approach. In addition, the 2009-2010 report recorded activities relevant to the statutory review requirement, with a focus on a major DOD efficiency initiative that was ongoing at that time. Regarding quality, GAO found that the most recent report, dated 2012, generally did not reflect key elements of quality evaluations, which GAO identified in prior work and compiled as part of this review. For example, the report did not assess the reliability of the data used, define key terms, clearly state criteria used for analysis, or make recommendations. For example, OCMO officials familiar with the report told GAO that some DAFAs and military departments surveyed for the report provided more detail and information in their responses than others, but there was no assessment of the reliability of this information. Overall, OCMO officials acknowledged that the report was more of a collection of information, rather than an in-depth assessment. At the time of GAO's review, section 192(c) of title 10 of the United States Code required the Secretary of Defense to review the services and supplies each DAFA provides to ensure that (1) there is a continuing need for each DAFA; and (2) the provision of services and supplies by each DAFA, rather than by the military departments, is a more effective, economical, or efficient manner of providing those services and supplies or of meeting the requirements for combat readiness. From 1987 to 2012, DOD issued biennial reports to Congress to record its response to this statute, but the methodology and quality of those reports varied. Regarding quality, GAO found that the most recent report, dated 2012, generally did not reflect key elements of quality evaluations, which GAO identified in prior work and compiled as part of this review. For example, the most recent combat support agency reports generally have clear evaluation questions, use sufficient and appropriate data, and support conclusions with data and analysis. Last, all of the DOD combat support agency reports GAO reviewed contain actionable recommendations. The fragmentation and overlap among the DAFAs that provide human resources services to other defense organizations have resulted in negative effects, such as inconsistent performance information, inefficiencies resulting from fragmented information technology (IT) systems, and inefficiencies related to overhead costs. The fragmentation and overlap among the DAFAs that provide human resources services to other defense organizations have resulted in negative effects, such as inconsistent performance information, inefficiencies resulting from fragmented IT systems, and inefficiencies related to overhead costs. DOD has undertaken several efficiency initiatives since 2011 that are intended to improve the efficiency of headquarters organizations, including the DAFAs, and to identify related cost savings. These initiatives include the Secretary Gates Efficiencies, the More Disciplined Use of Resources, the Core Business Process Review, the Business Process and Systems Reviews, and a series of initiatives related to the savings required by the National",
    "gao_GAO-18-585T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees the Part D program, which provides prescription drug coverage to about 1.2 million beneficiaries. CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor and plan sponsors. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of opioid prescribing. This statement discusses (1) CMS's oversight of Part D beneficiaries who receive opioids, and (2) CMS's oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Medicare Part D: CMS Delegated Monitoring of Beneficiaries' Opioid Prescriptions to Plan Sponsors, but Did Not Have Sufficient Information on Those Most at Risk for Harm ( GAO-17-32, Oct. 17, 2017). GAO reviewed CMS's guidance and data on Part D beneficiaries, and interviewed CMS officials and six plan sponsors. What GAO Found In its October 2017 report, GAO found that CMS provided guidance to Medicare Part D plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization problems among Part D beneficiaries. The agency included this guidance in its annual letters to plan sponsors, known as call letters; it also provided a supplemental memo to plan sponsors in 2012. Among other things, these guidance documents instructed plan sponsors to implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to monitor beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. As part of the DUR systems, CMS required plan sponsors to have methods to identify beneficiaries who were potentially overusing specific drugs or groups of drugs, including opioids. Also in 2013, CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS), which outlined criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids, and to oversee sponsors' compliance with CMS's opioid overutilization policy. Plan sponsors may use the OMS criteria for their DUR systems, but they had some flexibility to develop their own targeting criteria within CMS guidance. At the time of GAO's review, the OMS considered beneficiaries to be at a high risk of opioid overuse when they met all three of the following criteria: 1. received a total daily MED greater than 120 mg for 90 consecutive 2. received opioid prescriptions from four or more health care providers in the previous 12 months, and 3. received opioids from four or more pharmacies in the previous 12 months. The criteria excluded beneficiaries with a cancer diagnosis and those in hospice care, for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate. GAO found that CMS relied on separate patient safety measures developed and maintained by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance to assess how well Part D plan sponsors were monitoring beneficiaries and taking appropriate actions. In 2016, CMS started tracking plan sponsors' performance on three patient safety measures that were directly related to opioids. However, one difference between these approaches was that the patient safety measures separately identified beneficiaries who fulfill each criterion individually. GAO also found that CMS did not have sufficient information on most beneficiaries potentially at risk for harm, according to CDC's 2016 guidelines. These guidelines noted that long-term use of high doses of opioids\u2014those above a daily MED greater than 90 mg per day\u2014are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible. GAO recommended that CMS gather information over time on the total number of beneficiaries who receive high opioid morphine equivalent doses regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies used. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendation. CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor and plan sponsors, but efforts did not specifically monitor opioid prescribing. CMS's guidance focused broadly on prescription drugs, and did not specifically address opioids. GAO concluded that although these efforts provided valuable information, CMS lacked information necessary to adequately oversee opioid prescribing. CMS's oversight actions focused broadly on Schedule II drugs rather than specifically on opioids. For example, CMS's analyses to identify outlier providers did not indicate the extent to which they may be overprescribing opioids specifically. According to CMS officials, they directed the National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (NBI MEDIC) to focus on Schedule II drugs, because these drugs have a high potential for abuse, whether they are opioids or other drugs. However, without specifically identifying opioids in these analyses\u2014or an alternate source of data\u2014CMS lacked data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and therefore cannot assess progress toward meeting its goals related to reducing opioid use, which would be consistent with federal internal control standards. Federal internal control standards require agencies to conduct monitoring activities and to use quality information to achieve objectives and address risks. As a result, GAO recommended that CMS require plan sponsors to report on investigations and other actions taken related to providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. HHS did not",

CMS is the largest provider of health insurance in the United States, with $702 billion in fiscal year 2017. CMS is also the largest provider of Medicare Advantage, which provides health insurance for persons aged 65 and over, certain individuals with disabilities, and individuals with end-stage renal disease. CMS's program-integrity approach includes efforts to address waste, abuse, and improper payments as well as fraud across its four principal programs. GAO was asked to review CMS's efforts to address fraud risks in Medicare. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which CMS's antifraud efforts align with the Fraud Risk Framework and (2) the extent to which CMS has taken steps to manage fraud risks in Medicare. This statement is based on GAO's December 2017 report on Medicare fraud risk management and its December 2017 report on Medicare Advantage. GAO reviewed relevant federal internal control standards and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found CMS's antifraud efforts partially aligned with the Fraud Risk Framework. Consistent with the framework, CMS has demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts. It has also taken steps to establish a culture conducive to fraud risk management, although it could expand its antifraud training to include all employees. CMS has taken some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare; however, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare as defined in the Fraud Risk Framework. Such a risk assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS has taken some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for the Medicare program as a whole. Such a risk assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS has taken some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare, but it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for the Medicare program as a whole. Such a risk assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare because, within the Center for Program Integrity (CPI), its focus has been on addressing specific vulnerabilities among provider groups that have shown themselves particularly prone to fraud, waste, and abuse. With this approach, however, it is unlikely that CMS will be able to design and implement the most-appropriate control activities to respond to the full portfolio of fraud risks. Using a fraud risk assessment for Medicare and closely examining existing fraud control activities and residual fraud risks, CMS could be better positioned to address fraud risks facing this growing program and develop preventive control activities. Such analysis would also help CMS determine whether additional, preferably preventive, fraud controls are needed to mitigate residual risks, make adjustments to existing control activities, and potentially scale back or remove control activities that are addressing tolerable fraud risks. CMS has established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity control activities that, if aligned with a risk-based antifraud strategy, could enhance the effectiveness of fraud risk management in Medicare. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to CMS to improve its antifraud efforts. In its December 2017 report, GAO recommended that CMS (1) conduct fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid to include respective fraud risk profiles and plans for regularly updating the assessments and profiles; (2) develop a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare, which would include plans for monitoring and evaluation; and (3) develop an antifraud strategy that is aligned with and responsive to regularly assessed fraud risks. HHS stated that it is currently evaluating its options with regards to implementing this recommendation. As of July 2018, the recommendation remains open.",

IPERA also requires executive agencies' IGs to annually determine and report on whether their respective agencies complied with certain IPERA-related criteria. GAO was asked to review the extent to which 24 CFO Act agencies complied with IPERA criteria for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This report examines (1) the extent to which 24 CFO Act agencies complied with IPERA criteria for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and the trends evident since 2011, and (2) the extent to which CFO Act agencies addressed requirements for programs and activities reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016, and communicated their strategies to Congress for reducing improper payments and achieving compliance. GAO reviewed the 24 CFO Act agencies' IPERA compliance reports for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and the trends evident since 2011, as reported by their inspectors general (IG). GAO also reviewed the content of each agency's notification to Congress to evaluate agencies' efforts to communicate quality information to Congress concerning their strategies for achieving compliance consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. GAO also reviewed the IGs' fiscal years 2016 and 2017 IPERA compliance reports for the agencies with programs reported as noncompliant for 2 consecutive years and found that the IGs did not make any recommendations regarding additional funding needed to bring these programs into compliance. What GAO Found Over half of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) Act agencies were reported as noncompliant under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Specifically, 13 agencies were reported as noncompliant with one or more IPERA criteria for fiscal year 2016, and 14 agencies were reported as noncompliant for fiscal year 2017. Nine of these agencies have been reported as noncompliant in one or more programs every year since IPERA was implemented in 2011 (see figure). Almost a third (18 programs) of the 58 programs that contributed to 14 CFO Act agencies' noncompliance under IPERA, as of fiscal year 2017, were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years. The number of programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years has continued to increase since fiscal year 2015. Specifically, 12 programs (associated with 7 agencies) were reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2015, and the number increased to 14 programs (associated with 8 agencies) and 18 programs (associated with 9 agencies) as of fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. These programs accounted for a substantial portion of the $141 billion total estimated improper payments for fiscal year 2017. Eight CFO Act agencies' programs were reported as noncompliant under IPERA for 3 or more consecutive years, as of fiscal year 2016. Three of these agencies did not notify Congress of their program's continued noncompliance as required. In addition to submitting the required notifications for their noncompliant programs, the other five agencies also included additional information in their notifications\u2014such as measurable milestones, designation of senior officials, and accountability mechanisms\u2014useful for assessing their efforts to achieve compliance. In June 2018, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated its guidance to clarify agency reporting requirements for each consecutive year a program is reported as noncompliant. However, OMB's updated guidance did not direct agencies to include other types of quality information in their notifications for programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years that could help Congress to more effectively assess their efforts to address long-standing challenges and other issues associated with these programs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB take steps to update its guidance to specify other types of quality information that agencies with programs reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years should include in their notifications to Congress, such as significant matters related to risks, issues, root causes, measurable milestones, designated senior officials, accountability mechanisms, and corrective actions or strategies planned or taken by agencies to achieve compliance.

GAO was asked to testify on its September 2017 report on the Navy's and Marine Corps' efforts to improve their amphibious operations capabilities. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which the services have completed training for certain amphibious operations priorities and (2) the extent to which the services have taken steps to improve their amphibious operations capabilities. This statement is based on GAO's September 2017 report, which examined the extent to which the services completed training for certain amphibious operations priorities and the extent to which the services have taken steps to improve their amphibious operations capabilities. GAO reviewed the services' training documents and interviewed officials from 23 Marine Corps units. What GAO Found In its September 2017 report, GAO found that the Navy and Marine Corps units deploying as part of Amphibious Ready Groups completed required training for amphibious operations, but the Marine Corps has been unable to consistently accomplish training for other service amphibious operations priorities. Specifically, based on GAO's review of deployment certification messages from 2014 through 2016, GAO found that each deploying Navy ARG completed training for the amphibious operations mission in accordance with training standards. Similarly, GAO found that each Marine Expeditionary Unit completed all of its mission-essential tasks that are required during the predeployment training program. However, GAO also found that based on GAO's review of unit-level readiness data from fiscal year 2014 through 2016, Marine Corps units were unable to fully accomplish training for other amphibious operations priorities. These shortfalls include home-station unit training to support contingency requirements, service-level exercises, and experimentation and concept development for amphibious operations. GAO also found that the services have taken some steps to identify and address training shortfalls, but these efforts are incomplete because the services' current approach for amphibious operations training does not incorporate strategic training and leading risk-management practices. Specifically, GAO found that the Marine Corps does not prioritize all available training resources. For Marine Corps units not scheduled for a Marine Expeditionary Unit deployment, officials described an ad hoc process to allocate any remaining available amphibious ship training time among home-station units. The Navy and Marine Corps have not systematically evaluate a full range of training resource alternatives to achieve amphibious operations priorities. Given the limited availability of amphibious ships for training, the Navy and Marine Corps have not systematically incorporated selected training resource alternatives into home-station training plans. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services, to include issuing strategic documents that discuss the importance of improving naval integration and establishing mechanisms to coordinate their amphibious operations training capabilities. However, in GAO's September 2017 report, GAO found that the services have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices that would help drive efforts to improve naval integration. For example, the services have not developed a joint strategy that defines and articulates common outcomes to achieve naval integration, compatible policies, procedures, and systems, and better leverage training resources. GAO also found that some of the Navy and Marine Corps' systems for managing and conducting integrated training are incompatible, leading to inefficiencies in the process to manage unit-level training events.",

However, the agency does not track the number of beneficiaries who receive potentially dangerous levels of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies. Neither the data gathered as part of OMS, nor patient safety measures gathered so far are adequate to provide CMS with the information necessary to track progress toward its goals. Without tracking the number of beneficiaries who receive potentially dangerous levels of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies, and then examining changes in that number over time, CMS lacks key information that would be useful to determine if it is making progress toward reducing the risk of opioid harm for Part D beneficiaries. CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor and plan sponsors, but efforts do not specifically monitor opioids.

    "gao_GAO-18-310": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has long provided regulatory oversight of railroad safety, both passenger and freight, that operate on the general system. However, serious incidents continue to occur on railroads and rail transit, posing safety risks to passengers, railroad employees, and the public. FRA oversees safety of railroads and rail transit, and FTA oversees safety of rail transit systems in 28 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The MAP-21 Act of 2015 provided FTA with new authorities to oversee the safety of rail transit, potentially addressing some of the weaknesses identified by various stakeholders. GAO was asked to review FTA's rail safety oversight program. This report examines (1) the extent to which FRA and FTA have a centralized approach to overseeing the safety of rail transit, and (2) the strengths and limitations of FRA's and FTA's approaches to overseeing the safety of rail transit. GAO reviewed FRA and FTA safety regulations, interviewed FTA and state safety agency officials, and analyzed FTA's and state safety agency data. GAO also interviewed officials from FTA, NTSB, and WMATA. What GAO Found The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has a more centralized safety oversight program for railroads, while FTA is implementing changes to the rail transit oversight program, established in federal statute, which relies on states to monitor and enforce safety. Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) the establishment of safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, such as audits and investigations, based on those regulations, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed.

Key characteristics of both programs include: (1) the establishment of safety regulations, (2) inspections and other oversight activities, such as audits and investigations, based on those regulations, and (3) enforcement mechanisms to ensure that safety deficiencies are addressed. FRA and FTA's approaches to their rail safety oversight missions each have strengths and limitations, including how the agencies develop safety regulations, conduct inspections, and carry out enforcement. Compared to FRA's long-standing role in providing safety oversight over railroads, FTA is in the process of implementing significant changes to its program for rail transit safety oversight after being granted new authorities in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) and the Federal Surface Transportation Safety Act (FAST Act). FRA's extensive and well-established safety regulations are a strength of FRA's safety oversight program. FTA has made some progress toward developing appropriate safety regulations, such as identifying subjects for potential regulatory action. With respect to inspections, FRA's use of a risk-based approach to distributing inspection resources is a strength. FTA has sought to address previously identified deficiencies in state safety oversight by recommending that state safety agencies develop risk-based inspection programs. FTA, though, has not provided states guidance for these efforts. With respect to enforcement, FRA's use of its enforcement authorities is a strength. FTA is also implementing new statutory requirements that state safety agencies have enforcement authorities but does not have a process or methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of these enforcement practices. Without a method for determining the effectiveness of state enforcement, FTA may not have the information needed to identify ineffective state enforcement, which risks allowing safety deficiencies to remain for long periods of time. By providing this additional guidance and direction to the state safety agencies, FTA would help ensure that states are able to effectively identify and resolve rail transit safety issues. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FTA develop guidance for state safety agencies about how to develop and implement a risk-based inspection program. DOT agreed with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-443": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2013 amendments to SRIA allow tribes to request federal disaster assistance, thereby allowing tribes to exercise their sovereignty. The SRIA amendments also allow tribes to apply directly for federal disaster assistance. GAO was asked to review the factors that influence tribes' decisions about how to request federal disaster assistance. This report examines (1) the factors that influence selected tribes' decisions about how to seek federal assistance through a major disaster declaration and (2) the actions the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is taking to assist tribal efforts to request and manage disaster declarations. GAO surveyed the 36 tribes that requested or joined a state's request for a major disaster declaration from 2013 through 2016 and interviewed tribal officials and FEMA officials. GAO also visited 7 tribes selected from among the 23 tribes that responded to GAO's survey. What GAO Found According to FEMA data, between 2013 and 2016, 36 tribes made requests for disaster assistance as a direct recipient or by joining a state's request. Of those 36 tribes, Fifteen tribes made a total of 17 direct requests to the U.S. President through FEMA for major disaster declarations. Eight of these requests were approved across 7 tribes. From 2013 through 2016, the Pueblo of Santa Clara, New Mexico was the only tribe approved for two major disaster declarations for severe storms and flooding in 2013. The remaining 9 direct requests were denied across 9 tribes. Twenty-nine tribes were sub-recipients under 36 state major disaster declaration requests. Eight tribes made a direct request and also joined at least one state request for a major disaster declaration. Tribal officials reported that there are several factors they considered when deciding whether to make a direct request or to join a state's request for a disaster declaration, during the 2013 to 2016 period. On the basis of the cumulative responses from these officials, GAO found that tribal sovereignty, financial matters, FEMA support, and the tribe's emergency management capacity were key factors in their decision-making process. For example, tribal officials reported that the potential to receive additional assistance from states to pay the nonfederal cost share might influence them to join a state's request. Conversely, the timeliness of reimbursement and the potential to receive administrative costs and hazard mitigation grant funds might be factors in deciding to make a direct request. Tribal officials' confidence in the level of support they expected to receive from FEMA influenced their decision whether to make a direct request or to join a state. Specifically, in response to GAO's survey, tribes that made direct requests largely reported that they believed FEMA's policies and requirements would be clear enough for them to effectively navigate the processes and that timely and accurate information would be available. In contrast, multiple tribes that decided to join a state's request reported that their concerns in those areas influenced their decisions to join a state's request. Tribal officials' confidence in the tribe's capacity to manage the major disaster declaration process and subsequently administer the recovery without assistance from a state was a key factor in determining whether or not to seek a request directly or join a state request. Tribes, like states, have to carry out specific tasks and meet eligibility requirements to be able to make a direct request and manage the recovery process for a major disaster declaration. Developing and maintaining such a capacity requires, among other things, having in-house knowledge or the ability to contract for (or otherwise access) specialized expertise to navigate through complex planning and processes. FEMA officials acknowledged that tribes face challenges getting federal grant funds to help them enhance their emergency management capacity. According to FEMA officials, the agency has provided multiple opportunities through Federal Register notices and ongoing consultations for input into the development of the guidance that currently governs the tribal request process for major disaster declarations. Specifically, FEMA processed tribal declaration requests using existing state declaration regulations in order to allow tribal governments the choice to use the new authority immediately and to provide time for consultation on drafts of the Tribal Declarations Pilot Guidance. FEMA issued a final version of the guidance, with which it will manage tribal declaration requests during the pilot phase, in January 2017. The publication of this guidance in January 2017 officially started phase 2, the pilot phase, of the tribal declarations implementation. FEMA officials told GAO that, before beginning the development of regulations on tribal disaster declarations, they intend to operate under the pilot guidance for at least 2 years. They noted that they cannot specify an exact date on which they expect to finalize the guidance because there is uncertainty about what kind of disasters will strike and where.

In addition, the U.S. commercial space launch industry is changing with the emergence of some suborbital launch vehicles that are capable of being launched into space more than once and can enable space tourism. GAO was asked to review the Office of Commercial Space Transportation. This report examines (1) the views of stakeholders on the potential advantages and disadvantages of moving the office, (2) the steps that can be taken to move the office, and (3) key practices and questions for consideration when evaluating proposals for or implementing organizational changes such as a consolidation or merger. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, FAA, and commercial space launch companies. What GAO Found Representatives from the commercial space launch companies and spaceports GAO spoke to described both potential advantages and disadvantages of moving the office, but most of them favored moving the office. On the other hand, most FAA officials GAO interviewed did not favor the idea. A senior official in the Office of Commercial Space Transportation said that there are advantages and disadvantages to moving the office and that whether such an action would be beneficial depended on the implementation details and the administration's preferences. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation said they currently do not have plans to move the office. Stakeholders and officials provided perspectives on what they believe might result from a move including discussions regarding communicating with the industry and coordinating within FAA, program operations, updating regulations, and obtaining resources for the office, and other issues. All or part of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation can be transferred back to the Secretary's office through a rulemaking process as was used in 1995 to amend the existing DOT delegation regulation. This process, which does not require congressional approval, was used when the Secretary of Transportation delegated the office's responsibilities from DOT to FAA in 1995. FAA and DOT officials said the following steps would need to be taken to move the office: Equivalent salaries would need to be determined for employees who are transferring because FAA and DOT have different pay scales. Legal, human capital, and administrative support currently provided by FAA would need to be obtained from DOT. New physical space for the office would likely need to be obtained, as FAA and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation are in different buildings. New processes and procedures for coordination and communication would need to be established. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-24": "Why GAO Did This Study The Internet is a tool for individuals to purchase firearms and ammunition. The National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 are the primary federal laws that regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, and possession of firearms. There are no laws that specifically regulate firearms transactions facilitated by the Internet. Rather, firearms transactions facilitated by the Internet are subject to the same legal requirements and regulations as traditional firearms sales. GAO was asked to review the extent to which the Internet may facilitate illegal firearm transactions. This report examines (1) how the Internet may facilitate illegal firearm transactions, (2) the actions the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) takes to enforce firearms regulations, and (3) the extent to which agents attempted to illegally purchase firearms on the Surface Web. GAO analyzed ATF documents and interviewed ATF and third-party officials. GAO also conducted covert tests on the Dark Web and the Surface Web. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. ATF provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. What GAO Found The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) takes various actions to enforce firearm regulations related to prohibited firearm transactions facilitated by the Internet. ATF does not distinguish between private firearms transactions taking place in person versus those that use the Internet to facilitate the sale. Licensed and nonlicensed sellers use the Internet to facilitate firearm sales in a variety of ways. Major retailers with a federal firearms license enable customers to browse available firearms on their websites but require transactions to be made in person at the store. Online auction and marketplace websites, online classifieds, and online forums also facilitate sales between buyers and both licensed and nonlicensed sellers. Depending on the website, potential buyers can search for firearms nationwide or narrowed down to city or zip code. ATF officials who oversee Internet-related investigations said that it is not possible to monitor private firearms transactions coordinated over the Internet as they take place. Federal law does not require the seller in a private firearm transaction to conduct a background check or otherwise process paperwork through ATF. ATF carries out a variety of regulatory activities, including routine inspections of licensed firearms dealers, regulatory oversight of firearms transactions of FFLs, and investigations of individuals engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license. ATF agents successfully purchased two firearms from sellers GAO located on a Dark Web marketplace as a result of seven total attempts. ATF officials stated that the Dark Web is completely anonymous and is designed to facilitate criminal activity online. Further, an ATF report states that most used firearms are sold via the online auctions, online marketplaces, and on the Dark Web as compared to the Surface Web. In the seven attempts, GAO agents did not disclose any information indicating they were prohibited from possessing a firearm. In the five attempts where GAO did not ultimately purchase a firearm, the prospective seller stopped responding to GAO inquiries, stated the firearm was no longer for sale, refused to use an escrow account for payment, or experienced technical problems using the Dark Web marketplace. The first weapon that GAO purchased was an AR-15 rifle, which is a semiautomatic firearm. The serial number on the firearm was obliterated. The Dark Web seller shipped the dismantled weapon directly to the undercover address provided by GAO. It is unlawful for any person to possess or ship in interstate commerce a firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered, if the individual had such knowledge about the serial number. Additionally, because the firearm was shipped across state lines, the seller may not have been a resident of the same state as GAO. GAO did not confirm whether the seller notified the shipping company that the shipment contained a firearm. Any of these circumstances\u2014removing a serial number, selling to a resident of a different state, or failing to properly notify the shipping company that the shipment contained a firearm\u2014if proven, would likely violate federal law. GAO is referring information regarding two Dark Web purchases to applicable law-enforcement agencies to inform any ongoing investigations for any further action they deem appropriate. All of GAO's attempts to illegally purchase firearms on the Surface Web were unsuccessful. Specifically, private sellers on Surface Web gun forums and in classified ads were unwilling to sell a firearm to GAO agents that self-identified as being prohibited from possessing a firearm. In these 72 attempts, 56 sellers refused to complete a transaction once GAO revealed that either the shipping address was across state lines or that GAO was prohibited by law from owning firearms.

    "gao_GAO-18-612": "Why GAO Did This Study Since 1993, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has obligated more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, primarily using funds appropriated through the ESF. USAID, with overall foreign policy guidance from State, implements most ESF programs, including programs related to private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. According to USAID officials, this assistance to the West Bank and Gaza contributes to building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society\u2014a goal that USAID described as being in the interest of the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed USAID documents and data on ESF assistance for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including expenditures as of March 31, 2018, and interviewed USAID and State officials in Washington, D.C., and Tel Aviv, Israel. What GAO Found As of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64 percent) of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated portions of the allocated funds for direct payments to PA creditors\u2014specifically, payments to two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and to a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Project assistance obligated for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 accounted for about $215 million (74 percent) and $184 million (72 percent), respectively, of USAID's obligations of ESF assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for those fiscal years. Payments to the PA's creditors accounted for the remaining obligations\u2014about $75 million (26 percent) of fiscal year 2015 obligations and about $70 million (28 percent) of fiscal year 2016 obligations. Before using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance to pay PA creditors, USAID vetted the creditors to ensure that the assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism, as required by its policies and procedures. USAID determined that certain legal requirements, including the requirement for an assessment of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning, were not applicable for direct payments of these funds to PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID continued to commission external assessments and financial audits of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. USAID provided comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-600": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for carrying out the nation's polar icebreakers, which are the nation's most powerful active non-nuclear icebreakers. The Coast Guard is planning to recapitalize the Polar Star's key systems starting in 2020 to extend the service life of the ship until the planned delivery of the second HPIB. GAO was asked to review the HPIB program. This report examines (1) the extent to which the HPIB program has taken steps to develop mature designs and technologies consistent with best practices, (2) the extent to which the HPIB program has taken steps to set realistic cost and schedule estimates, and (3) the status of the HPIB program's contracting efforts and funding considerations. GAO reviewed program documents, interviewed Coast Guard and Navy officials, and compared the HPIB program's cost estimate to best practices. What GAO Found The Coast Guard did not conduct a preliminary design review to assess the design maturity of the ship or a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies. This approach meets Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acquisition policy requirements but is contrary to GAO's best practices. The Coast Guard intends on using what it refers to as proven technologies for the HPIB but has not conducted a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies. GAO found that the Coast Guard's cost estimate and schedule that informed DHS's decision to authorize the HPIB program do not reflect the full scope of the program's risks. GAO found that the estimate is not fully reliable because it does not reflect the full range of possible costs over the HPIB's 30-year lifecycle. GAO also found the HPIB schedule was not informed by a realistic assessment of the work necessary to construct the ship. Rather, the schedule was driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard's only operating HPIB reaches the end of its service life. Reliable cost estimates and schedules are key elements of an executable business case, and are needed at the outset of programs\u2014when competitive pressures to obtain funding for the program are high\u2014to provide decision makers with insight into how risks affect a program's ability to deliver within its cost and schedule goals. The HPIB's acquisition strategy anticipates award of a contract that will have options, includes efforts aimed at mitigating cost risks, and acknowledges the use of foreign suppliers to provide components and design services as allowable under statute and regulation. Since 2013, the program has received $360 million in funding, which includes both Coast Guard and Navy appropriations. Moving forward, it is unclear how much Coast Guard and Navy funding will be used to fund the contract. The Coast Guard and the Navy have an agreement in place for funding issues, but the agreement does not fully address how they plan to address cost growth on the program. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Coast Guard, DHS, and the Navy (1) conduct a technology readiness assessment, (2) update the HPIB cost estimate in accordance with best practices, and (3) update the financial management and budget execution appendix of the HPIB agreement to clarify and document agreement on how all cost growth on the HPIB program, including changes in scope, will be addressed between the Coast Guard and the Navy. DHS concurred with all six recommendations and identified actions it planned to take to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-19-155": "Why GAO Did This Study The Air Force relies on RPAs to gather intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information. RPAs are primarily used to fly aircraft to gather intelligence or conduct surveillance. The Air Force established a pilot career field in 2010 to provide officers with the opportunity to fly RPAs. The Air Force also established a non-operational staff position requiring RPA pilots. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's management of its non-operational staff positions. This report examines (1) the extent to which RPA pilots have been promoted and selected for developmental education opportunities, (2) the extent to which the Air Force has assigned non-operational staff positions requiring RPA pilots, and (3) the extent to which the Air Force has reviewed its oversight process to manage its non-operational staff positions requiring aviator expertise. GAO analyzed Air Force promotion data from 2014 through 2017 and interviewed Air Force officials. GAO also analyzed the Air Force's non-operational staff position justifications. What GAO Found The percentage of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilots promoted were generally similar in comparison to the promotion rates of pilots in other career fields since 2013. However, the promotion of one or two RPA pilots could have a large effect on their promotion rate. For example, the promotion rates for RPA pilots from captain to major were generally similar to the promotion rates for other pilots from 2014 through 2017. The promotion rates for RPA pilots from lieutenant colonel to colonel that GAO calculated should be considered cautiously as fewer than 10 RPA pilots were eligible for promotion boards each year through this time period. The Air Force promoted enlisted RPA sensor operators at a rate similar to the rates of all enlisted servicemembers, according to GAO's analysis of Air Force promotion data. Specifically, the Air Force promoted an average of 100 RPA sensor operators (or an average of 26 percent) annually for the period from 2013 through 2017. Similarly, the Air Force annually promoted an average of approximately 27,000 enlisted personnel (or an average of 25 percent) for the same period. The Air Force has assigned over 75 percent of the non-operational staff positions that require an RPA pilot to the organizations that had requested those positions, according to GAO's analysis of service headquarters data. However, the overall number of non-operational staff positions that require an RPA pilot is about one-tenth of the number of those requiring pilots in other career fields. Air Force officials stated that the number of non-operational staff positions that require an RPA pilot is smaller than the number that require fighter, bomber, and mobility pilots because the career field is still growing. Air Force officials have noted problems with the current oversight process which may be hindering its ability to efficiently and effectively manage these non-operational staff positions as required by Air Force policy. For example, the Air Force has recently identified that a large number of these positions designated as requiring officers with aviator expertise lacked adequate justification for that requirement. By reviewing the efficiency and effectiveness of its management oversight process that provides information in a timelier and more widely accessible manner, the Air Force could better ensure that it makes informed decisions regarding the need for pilots in certain non-operational staff positions and is in compliance with policy. It also could help ensure that the Air Force more efficiently uses its short supply of expensive pilot resources. Ultimately, this may positively affect its ability to assign and develop effective leaders, such as those within the growing RPA career field. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Air Force review its management oversight process that provides information and documents the justifications of the Air Force's non-operational staff positions requiring aviator expertise, including RPA positions, to identify opportunities for increased efficiency and effectiveness and take any necessary actions. DOD concurred with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-325": "Why GAO Did This Study VA has a long-standing interest in promoting the commercialization of VA's inventions. In fiscal year 2016, VA received about $316,000 in royalties from 45 licenses for its inventions. VA has taken steps to educate researchers about requirements for researchers and universities to disclose inventions to VA, but VA has not made its online training on invention disclosure mandatory. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to commercialize inventions. This report examines (1) steps VA has taken to educate researchers about requirements for researchers and universities to disclose inventions to VA, and (2) the extent to which VA has ensured that universities report information about commercialization activities for joint inventions. GAO reviewed VA policies and procedures, interviewed VA and university officials, and analyzed 12 annual reports from eight universities. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken steps to educate researchers about requirements for researchers and universities to disclose inventions to VA, but VA officials reported that researchers have not consistently disclosed inventions to the department because they did not always fully understand VA's disclosure policy. VA officials said that the number of disclosures increased, which they said suggested underreporting had been occurring. In March 2017, VA officials said that many of the inventions from more than 50 researchers during a 5-year period at one university had not been disclosed until VA checked with the university and discovered the error. By November 2017, VA technology transfer officials thought disclosure had improved throughout VA, but they were still not able to describe the extent of the problem. VA has taken steps to educate universities about requirements for researchers and universities to disclose inventions to VA, but could enhance researchers' training. For example, VA established an online training program in 2017 covering the invention disclosure process, but the training is not mandatory. VA provided GAO with a report from October 2017 indicating that out of over 3,000 eligible researchers, 130 had taken the training (about 4 percent). VA has taken steps to make universities aware of VA researchers and their disclosure requirements in an effort to improve university disclosures to VA. GAO reviewed 16 agreements between VA and affiliated universities, including the five universities with agreements in GAO's sample, and all of the universities agreed to disclose joint inventions to the department. However, VA officials said that universities may not always disclose all inventions to VA. VA has increased communication with universities since 2016 to help ensure that universities report information about commercialization activities for joint inventions, but universities' reporting remained inconsistent as of January 2018. Under the original agreements, universities have the exclusive right to license and commercialize joint inventions. VA's awareness of the commercialization of such inventions depends on universities providing this information through annual reports, as required by the agreements. However, according to VA officials, prior to 2011, only about 20 percent of the 79 universities with which VA has agreements submitted annual reports. VA officials said they made an effort to increase annual reporting, and by 2013 it was up to 80 percent. The officials said, however, that the percentage of universities submitting annual reports dropped again after losing staff in the technology transfer office\u2014the office retained only three staff in subsequent years until fiscal year 2017 when there were 11 staff, including 5 technology transfer specialists. In addition, based on GAO's analysis of 12 annual reports from eight universities, the format and content of the reports have been inconsistent. Four universities submitted reports in a spreadsheet format; two universities submitted reports in portable document format; one university submitted a report in a Word format; and one submitted five different documents, including both PDF and spreadsheet. In addition, the annual reports differed considerably in the content they provided\u2014the more detailed annual reports included patent application numbers, patent expenses, the status of patent applications, and information about whether the patent had been licensed. In contrast, the less detailed annual reports did not provide any of this information on patents for the joint inventions. Moreover, one university only included active license agreements in its annual report, while other universities also included license agreements that were terminated. VA officials said that they were working on a template for universities to use in reporting on commercialization activities for joint inventions. However, it is not clear whether the template would inform universities of VA's requirements to submit an annual report even if they had no new commercialization activity in a given period. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA (1) require researchers to take online training on invention disclosure annually and (2) provide a standardized method that guides universities in fulfilling VA's reporting requirements for these annual reports, including their format and content. VA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-667T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government relies heavily on IT equipment manufactured in foreign nations. The reliance on IT supply chains introduces a myriad of security risks to federal information systems that, if realized, could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. This statement discusses (1) the risks that the reliance on IT supply chains introduces to federal information systems, (2) the extent to which the four national security-related agencies have addressed IT supply chain risks for their information systems, and (3) the extent to which the four agencies have implemented GAO's recommendations to address IT supply chain risks. This statement is based on GAO's March 2012 report, which examined the extent to which federal agencies have addressed IT supply chain risks for their information systems. What GAO Found In several reports issued since 2012, GAO has pointed out that the reliance on complex, global information technology (IT) supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal information and telecommunications systems. This includes the risk of these systems being manipulated or damaged by leading foreign cyber-threat nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Threats and vulnerabilities created by these cyber-threat nations, vendors or suppliers closely linked to cyber-threat nations, and other malicious actors can be sophisticated and difficult to detect and, thus, pose a significant risk to organizations and federal agencies. In March 2012, GAO reported that the four national security-related agencies (i.e., Defense, Justice, Energy, and DHS) had acknowledged the risks presented by supply chain vulnerabilities. However, the agencies varied in the extent to which they had addressed these risks by (1) defining supply chain protection measures for department information systems, (2) developing implementing procedures for these measures, and (3) establishing capabilities for monitoring compliance with, and the effectiveness of, such measures. Of the four agencies, the Department of Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. Specifically, the department's supply chain risk management efforts began in 2003 and included: a policy requiring supply chain risk to be addressed early and across a system's entire life cycle and calling for an incremental implementation of supply chain risk management through a series of pilot projects; a requirement that every acquisition program submit and update a \u201cprogram protection plan\u201d that was to, among other things, help manage risks from supply chain exploits or design vulnerabilities; procedures for implementing supply chain protection measures, such as an implementation guide describing 32 specific measures for enhancing supply chain protection and procedures for program protection plans identifying ways in which programs should manage supply chain risk; and a monitoring mechanism to determine the status and effectiveness of supply chain protection pilot projects, as well as monitoring compliance with and effectiveness of program protection policies and procedures for several acquisition programs. Conversely, GAO reported that the other three agencies had made limited progress in addressing supply chain risks for their information systems. For example, the Department of Justice had defined specific security measures for protecting against supply chain threats through the use of provisions in vendor contracts and agreements. However, Justice had not developed procedures for ensuring the effective implementation of these protection measures or a mechanism for verifying compliance with, and the effectiveness of, these measures. GAO stressed that, without such procedures, Justice would have limited assurance that its departmental information systems were being adequately protected against supply chain threats. In May 2011, the Department of Energy revised its information security program, which required Energy components to implement provisions based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Committee on National Security Systems guidance. However, the department was unable to provide details on implementation progress, milestones for completion, or how supply chain protection measures would be defined. Because it had not defined these measures or associated implementing procedures, GAO reported that the department was not in a position to monitor compliance or effectiveness. In March 2012, GAO reported that the four national security-related agencies had participated in interagency efforts to address supply chain security, including participation in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, development of technical and policy tools, and collaboration with the intelligence community. In support of the cybersecurity initiative, Defense and DHS jointly led an interagency initiative on supply chain risk management to address issues of globalization affecting the federal government's IT. Also, DHS had developed a comprehensive portfolio of technical and policy-based product offerings for federal civilian departments and agencies, including technical assessment capabilities, acquisition support, and incident response capabilities. The efforts of the four agencies could benefit all federal agencies in addressing their IT supply chain risks. What GAO Recommends In its March 2012 report, GAO made eight recommendations to the four national security-related agencies to better address IT supply chain risks for their departmental information systems. The agencies generally agreed with GAO's recommendations and, subsequently, implemented seven of the eight recommendations. Specifically,",
    "gao_GAO-18-89": "Why GAO Did This Study Leaks from natural gas storage sites can cause economic disruptions and environmental damage. The PIPES Act of 2016 directed DOT to issue minimum safety standards for all natural gas storage sites by June 2018. The act also directed GAO to review PHMSA's efforts to enforce these standards. This report examines (1) the status of PHMSA's efforts to implement the requirement under the PIPES Act of 2016 to issue minimum safety standards for natural gas storage sites, and (2) the extent to which PHMSA has planned strategically to enforce its safety standards for natural gas storage sites. GAO reviewed PHMSA's interim final rule and other documents, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA) has issued an interim final rule that includes minimum safety standards based largely on industry consensus standards, as required by the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016. The rule took effect in January 2017 and provided that existing facilities (and those constructed by July 18, 2017) must meet the standards by January 18, 2018. PHMSA is now considering public comments on its interim standards, and it plans to finalize them by issuing a final rule by January 2018. PHMSA also has stated that it will delay enforcement of certain standards in the interim final rule until 1 year after issuance of the final rule. To enforce PHMSA's safety standards, PHMSA officials have taken a variety of steps to establish a safety enforcement program for natural gas storage sites, but they have not yet followed certain leading practices of strategic planning in starting PHMSA's natural gas storage program. Specifically, PHMSA officials have started developing a training program for natural gas storage inspectors. They also have established a strategic goal and begun developing a training performance goal for their natural gas safety enforcement program. However, they have not yet followed certain leading practices for strategic planning\u2014the systematic process for defining desired outcomes and translating this vision into goals and steps to achieve them. For example, PHMSA's training performance goal does not define the level of performance officials hope to achieve or address all core program activities, such as conducting effective inspections. In addition, PHMSA has not used baseline data or budgetary information to inform the development of performance goals. As PHMSA continues developing performance goals and collects relevant data, using available data to inform and refine these goals may help PHMSA ensure that its goals are achievable. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that PHMSA define levels of performance, address core program activities, and use baseline data as it continues developing performance goals for its natural gas storage program. DOT concurred with the recommendations and provided additional information on steps it is taking or plans to take as part of its oversight of natural gas storage sites.",
    "gao_GAO-18-561": "Why GAO Did This Study The Columbia River Basin provides water quality benefits to many public and private interests and is vital to many industries in the Pacific Northwest. However, activities from these industries have affected the environment in the Basin and, among other impacts, impaired water quality in some areas to the point where human health is at risk and historic salmon and steelhead stocks are at risk or extinct. Section 123 of the Clean Water Act requires EPA to establish the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, including its associated Working Group. Section 123 also requires GAO to report on the extent to which EPA and OMB have implemented Clean Water Act Section 123. This report examines (1) restoration efforts to improve water quality in the Columbia River Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016; (2) approaches to collaboration that entities have used for selected efforts, including factors they identified that enabled or hindered collaboration in the Basin; (3) the sources of funding and federal funding expenditures; and, (4) the extent to which EPA and OMB have implemented Clean Water Act Section 123. GAO surveyed entities that implement restoration efforts in the Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016; reviewed relevant laws, including the Clean Water Act; and interviewed officials from 11 federal agencies. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2010 through 2016, various entities\u2014federal and state agencies, tribes and tribal organizations, and nongovernmental entities\u2014identified a range of restoration efforts they implemented related to improving water quality in the Columbia River Basin. Although there have been some plans to guide certain restoration efforts for parts of the Basin, there is no overall plan to guide water quality-related restoration efforts throughout the Columbia River Basin or a requirement for a federal agency or others to develop such a plan. GAO found that entities implemented their restoration efforts under a range of authorities and programmatic missions. At the federal and state levels, many of the restoration efforts were implemented as part of programs with a broader geographic scope than the Basin. For example, many of the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts are part of programs that have a nationwide focus, such as the Clean Water Act Section 106 Water Pollution Control Grant Program, which provides grants to states, territories, interstate agencies, and eligible tribes to establish and administer water pollution control programs for the prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution. Conversely, other restoration efforts have been implemented exclusively in the Columbia River Basin. GAO found that entities' approaches to collaboration for selected water quality-related restoration efforts in the Basin from fiscal years 2010 through 2016 varied based on the specific circumstances of the given effort. This was in part because there is no overall coordinating body to guide water quality-related restoration efforts throughout the Columbia River Basin or a requirement prior to the enactment of Section 123 for federal agencies or others to develop such a body. GAO obtained the views of officials from 11 federal agencies on factors that may enable and hinder collaboration in the Basin. Entities responding to GAO's survey reported that most of the restoration efforts they implemented in the Basin were supported through a mix of federal and nonfederal funding sources. For several reasons, GAO could not determine total federal expenditures to implement the restoration efforts identified through GAO's survey. Instead, GAO collected data from five federal agencies (BPA, Corps, EPA, Forest Service, and USGS) to provide illustrative examples of federal water quality-related restoration expenditures in the Basin. EPA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have not yet implemented actions required under Clean Water Act Section 123, which was enacted in 2016. Specifically, EPA has not yet established the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, including its associated Working Group. In addition, OMB has not yet prepared and submitted as part of the President's annual budget request an interagency crosscut budget on federal agencies' budgets for and spending on environmental protection and restoration efforts in the Basin. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EPA develop a program management plan that includes a schedule of the actions EPA will take and the resources and funding needed to establish and implement the Columbia River Basin Restoration Program, including the associated Working Group, and submit this plan to the appropriate congressional authorizing committees as part of the fiscal year 2020 budget process. EPA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-528": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid is the nation's largest health care financing program, with about $1.3 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2017. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states, with the federal government reimbursing states for a share of their expenditures for Medicaid covered services provided to eligible beneficiaries. The federal government reimburses states for a share of their expenditures for Medicaid covered services provided to eligible beneficiaries. States may provide Medicaid services under either or both a fee-for-service model and a managed care model. GAO was asked to review Medicaid managed care. This report examines (1) the types of payment risks that exist in Medicaid managed care, and (2) challenges to effective program integrity oversight. GAO reviewed Medicaid audit reports and other sources, and interviewed officials from CMS, states, and MCOs. GAO also interviewed 49 stakeholders, selected based on their responsibilities for program integrity and payment risks. What GAO Found GAO identified six types of payment risks in Medicaid managed care, with stakeholders viewing some risks as greater than others. Most of the stakeholders GAO spoke to agreed that these payment risks exist in Medicaid managed care. Four of these risks relate to the payments state Medicaid agencies make to MCOs, and two relate to payments that MCOs make to providers. In terms of the relative importance of these payment risks, two payment risks were more frequently cited by stakeholders as having a higher level of risk than other types\u2014incorrect MCO fee-for-service payments to providers and inaccurate state capitation rates. The remaining four payment risks were more frequently cited as having lower or unknown levels of risk: improper state capitation payments, state payments to noncompliant MCOs, incorrect MCO capitation payments, and duplicate state payments. Multiple challenges exist for effective program integrity oversight in Medicaid managed care, with stakeholders most frequently cited resource allocation, the quality of data and technology, and the adequacy of state policies and practices as key challenges. Some stakeholders also described strategies to address these challenges. CMS has taken important steps to address payment risks in Medicaid managed care, issuing a final rule, increasing guidance, and conducting oversight activities. However, some efforts are incomplete, and there are gaps in key oversight activities. For example, CMS has not issued its planned compendium with guidance on program integrity in Medicaid managed care, taken steps to address known factors limiting collaborative audits, or developed a process to help ensure that overpayments to providers are identified by the states. Without taking actions to address these issues, CMS is missing an opportunity to develop more robust program integrity safeguards that will best mitigate payment risks in managed care. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS expedite its efforts to communicate guidance to state stakeholders related to Medicaid managed care program integrity, and require states to report and document the amount of MCO overpayments to providers and how they are accounted for in state capitation rates. HHS concurred with these recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-217": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal employees who apply for retirement benefits are required to submit paper applications. OPM has attempted to modernize its retirement application processing operation over the past 2 decades. However, the agency has experienced numerous challenges and has a history of undertaking modernization projects that did not yield the intended outcomes. GAO was asked to review OPM's retirement application processing. This report examines (1) the extent to which OPM has assessed its retirement application processing operations and assistance to agencies, and (2) the extent to which selected agencies have developed strategies for preparing applications for retirement. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed OPM data on processing timeliness; and interviewed OPM officials. What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has assessed its retirement application processing operations and assistance to agencies, but it lacks a robust process for assessing its assistance to agencies. OPM officials reported that they have developed and implemented strategies to improve its retirement application processing operation, but have not assessed whether its strategies are effective at reducing processing delays. For example, OPM has developed a strategic vision for modernizing the current paper-based application, and employed strategies to address staffing capacity and minimize the number of incomplete applications. However, without improving its data collection and assessments of its strategies, OPM cannot know whether its strategies are effective at reducing the delays, or could be modified to yield better results. Furthermore, OPM's plan for modernizing its information technology (IT) retirement processing lacks cost estimates and timeliness, which means there are no measurable results with which to evaluate resource needs or interim progress. In addition, although OPM has established a performance goal on processing timeliness, its related performance measure does not include explanatory information that could make it more meaningful. OPM also has not set performance measures for various parts of the application review and processing operation that could provide clearer insights into where improvements may be needed. Lack of quality performance information hinders applicants and external stakeholders from understanding OPM's timeliness in processing applications, and limits OPM from better managing and monitoring program performance. Furthermore, OPM lacks a robust process for assessing its assistance to agencies, which makes it difficult for OPM to demonstrate the effectiveness of its assistance. Potential organizational changes and other external factors have created additional uncertainty for OPM. These challenges notwithstanding, approximately 100,000 federal employees depend on OPM each year to process retirement benefits, such as life and health insurance, in a timely manner. As such, OPM should endeavor to reduce processing delays, monitor and report on its progress through better performance information, and effectively partner across the federal government to improve processing timeliness. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OPM develop, document, and implement a Retirement Services IT modernization plan for initial project phases that is consistent with key aspects of IT project management, such as determining objectives, costs, and time frames for each initial phase. OPM partially concurred with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-88": "Why GAO Did This Study CMS is the federal agency responsible for preventing and detecting fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. CMS's programs include Medicare, Medicaid, and the health-insurance marketplaces. GAO was asked to review CMS's efforts to address fraud. This report examines (1) the extent to which CMS manages fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid and (2) the extent to which CMS's efforts align with the Fraud Risk Framework. GAO reviewed relevant federal internal control standards and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials and stakeholders. GAO also reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) manages fraud risks in its four principal programs as part of its broader program-integrity approach to address fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS's antifraud efforts for its four principal programs are part of the agency's broader program-integrity approach to address fraud, waste, and abuse. CMS's antifraud control activities mainly focus on providers in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS). CMS's Center for Program Integrity (CPI) is the agency's focal point for program integrity across the programs. CMS's antifraud control activities include, for example, the Fraud Prevention System (FPS), a predictive-analytics system that helps identify potentially fraudulent payments in Medicare FFS. Other control activities serve broader program-integrity purposes such as to reduce improper payments resulting from error, waste, and abuse in addition to preventing or detecting potential fraud. CMS's antifraud efforts partially align with the Fraud Risk Framework, which calls for an agency to commit to combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk management. Consistent with the Fraud Risk Framework, CMS has demonstrated commitment to combating fraud by creating a dedicated entity to lead antifraud efforts. It has also taken steps to establish a culture conducive to fraud risk management, although it could expand its antifraud training to include all employees. CMS has taken some steps to identify fraud risks in Medicare and Medicaid; however, it has not conducted a fraud risk assessment or developed a risk-based antifraud strategy for Medicare and Medicaid as defined in the Fraud Risk Framework. Such a risk assessment would provide the detailed information and insights needed to create a fraud risk profile, which, in turn, is the basis for creating an antifraud strategy. CMS has not conducted a fraud risk assessment for Medicare or Medicaid because, within CPI's broader approach of preventing and eliminating improper payments, its focus has been on addressing specific vulnerabilities among provider groups that have shown themselves particularly prone to fraud, waste, and abuse. With this approach, however, it is unlikely that CMS will be able to design and implement the most-appropriate control activities to respond to the full portfolio of fraud risks. Using a fraud risk assessment for Medicare Part C and closely examining existing fraud control activities and residual fraud risks, CMS could be better positioned to address fraud risks facing this growing program and develop preventive control activities. Using a fraud risk assessment for Medicare Part C and closely examining existing fraud control activities and residual fraud risks, CMS could be better positioned to address fraud risks facing this growing program and develop preventive control activities. Using a fraud risk assessment for Medicare Part C and closely examining existing fraud control activities and residual fraud risks, CMS could be better positioned to address fraud risks facing this growing program and develop preventive control activities. Considering fraud risks to which the Medicare and Medicaid programs are most vulnerable, in light of the malicious intent of those who aim to exploit the programs, would help CMS to examine its current control activities and potentially design new ones with recognition of fraudulent behavior it aims to prevent. A strategic approach to managing fraud risks within the programs is essential to ensure that a number of existing control activities and numerous stakeholder relationships and incentives are being aligned to produce desired results. Once developed, an antifraud strategy that is clearly articulated to various CMS stakeholders would help CMS to address fraud risks in a more coordinated and deliberate fashion. Thinking strategically about existing control activities, resources, tools, and information systems could help CMS to leverage resources while continuing to integrate Medicare and Medicaid program-integrity efforts along functional lines. A strategic approach grounded in a comprehensive assessment of fraud risks could also help CMS to identify future enhancements for existing control activities, such as new preventive capabilities for FPS or additional fraud factors in provider enrollment and revalidation, such as provider risk scoring, to stay in step with evolving fraud risks. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS (1) provide fraud-awareness training relevant to risks facing CMS programs and require new hires to undergo such training and (2) conduct fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid",
    "gao_GAO-18-338": "Why GAO Did This Study The Federal Reserve's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is responsible for producing U.S. notes. In 2013, BEP proposed to construct a new production facility in Washington, D.C., to replace the current facility. The House Report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the alternative that BEP pursues. This report examines (1) the factors that led BEP to determine that a new facility is the preferred alternative for its currency production process and (2) the extent to which BEP followed leading capital-planning practices and its 2017 cost estimate. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from BEP, Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and Treasury. What GAO Found From 2010 through 2017, BEP contracted for various studies to investigate alternatives, costs, potential sites, and program requirements to ensure future currency production in the Washington, D.C. area. In 2013, BEP concluded that the most costly option would be to renovate the current facility. The study found that the renovation alternative would be the most costly option and take the longest time to complete because it would require BEP to produce currency at its current location while it was being renovated. BEP officials said that the cost difference between the hybrid and new build was outweighed by the value of maintaining administrative functions in Washington, D.C., to facilitate the day-to-day decision-making process among BEP, Treasury, and Federal Reserve officials. The 2017 study provided cost estimates of BEP's and Treasury's preferred hybrid option, as well as the renovation option that BEP officials said they would pursue if BEP does not receive the necessary legal authority to construct a new facility. The study estimated that the hybrid option would cost approximately $1.389 billion and that the renovation option would cost approximately $1.957 billion. Federal Reserve officials said that they concur with the 2013 study that a new facility is warranted, that a renovation of the existing facility would be more costly than a new facility, and a renovation would not provide the same degree of efficiency. BEP officials said that, whatever alternative BEP pursues, the Federal Reserve will be financially responsible \u2014whether it is for a new building, a renovated building, or the continuation of the currency production process in the D.C. facility. BEP officials said that, whatever alternative BEP pursues, the Federal Reserve will be financially responsible \u2014whether it is for a new building, a renovated building, or the continuation of the currency production process in the D.C. facility. BEP officials said that, whatever alternative BEP pursues, the Federal Reserve will be financially responsible \u2014whether it is for a new building, a renovated building, or the continuation of the currency production process in the D.C. facility. BEP officials said that, whatever alternative BEP pursues, the Federal Reserve will be financially responsible \u2014whether it is for a new building, a renovated building, or the continuation of the currency production process in the D.C. facility. BEP generally followed leading capital-planning practices, and its 2017 cost estimate partially met the four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable cost estimate. For example, BEP's 2017 cost estimate included a contractor-developed estimate of the cost for the construction of a new production plant and the repurposing of the Main Building for BEP's administrative offices (the hybrid alternative) and a BEP-developed estimate of additional project costs, such as additional production equipment and real estate acquisition. GAO found this estimate partially met the four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable cost estimate. For example, the estimate included most life-cycle cost components, defined the program and its current schedule and included a consistent work breakdown structure. However, the estimate did not include operating and sustainment costs or information regarding the ground rules and assumptions used to develop the costs. BEP officials said that they will follow this updated guidance when developing any future cost estimates. The alternative that BEP pursues could have a financial effect on the federal government and ultimately taxpayers. For example, Treasury could experience costs if it needs to spend money to upgrade these buildings, but could also experience savings if it can repurpose the buildings or consolidate its employees into fewer buildings. The General Services Administration (GSA), which serves as the federal government's primary real property and disposal agent, could incur costs for the marketing and disposal process, but could create savings for the government if it could repurpose or sell any vacated buildings. Proceeds from sales of Treasury-controlled facilities would benefit the federal government. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that BEP (1) conduct a facility condition assessment, (2) develop a reliable cost estimate, (3) sell or",

    "gao_GAO-18-267T": "Why GAO Did This Study VA relies extensively on IT to provide health care to millions of veterans and their families. VA's health information system, VistA, is an integrated medical information system for all veterans' health information. It was developed in-house by VA's clinicians and IT personnel and has been in operation since the early 1980s. As such, the system has long been vital to helping ensure the quality of health care received by the nation's veterans and their dependents. VA has obligated more than $1 billion for contracts that supported two of four modernization efforts that the department has initiated. GAO was asked to testify on VA's progress in modernizing its health information system. This statement addresses (1) the history of VA's efforts to modernize its health information system, VistA, and (2) the extent to which VA has made progress in consolidating and optimizing its data centers and addressing other key FITARA-related initiatives. This statement is based on GAO's draft report that is currently with VA for comments. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has pursued four modernization efforts to modernize its health information system, VistA. These efforts reflect varying approaches that the department has considered to achieve a modernized health care system over the course of nearly two decades. The modernization efforts are described as follows. In 2001, VA undertook its first VistA modernization project, the HealtheVet initiative, with the goals of standardizing the department's health care system and eliminating the approximately 130 different systems used by its field locations at that time. In February 2011, VA began its second modernization initiative, the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR), in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD). The program was intended to replace the two separate electronic health record systems used by the two departments with a single, shared system. VA initiated its third modernization effort, the VistA Evolution program, in December 2013, with the goal of delivering capabilities such as the ability for health providers to have an integrated, real-time view of electronic health record data through the Joint Legacy Viewer, as well as the ability for health care providers to view sensitive DOD notes and highlight abnormal test results for patients. In June 2017, the VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department's approach to modernizing VistA. Specifically, rather than continue with its joint development of a single electronic health record system, the Secretary stated that the department plans to acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD is implementing. In this regard, DOD has contracted with the Cerner Corporation to provide a new integrated electronic health record system. According to the Secretary, VA has chosen to acquire this same product because it would allow all of VA's and DOD's patient data to reside in one system, thus enabling seamless care between the department and DOD without the manual and electronic exchange and reconciliation of data between two separate systems. VA is in the process of developing plans for its latest modernization effort, which will be dependent on the contract award in December 2017. VA's progress toward consolidating and optimizing data centers and addressing other key FITARA-related initiatives falls short of performance targets. For example, VA's progress toward closing data centers, and realizing the associated cost savings, lagged behind that of other covered agencies. In addition, VA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) certified adequate incremental development for its major IT investments for fiscal year 2017, but needs to update related policy. VA's CIO certified the use of adequate incremental development for all 10 of its major IT investments. However, VA had not yet updated the department's policy and process for the CIO's certification of major IT investments' adequate use of incremental development, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on the implementation of FITARA as GAO recommended. The department stated that it plans to address GAO's recommendation to establish a policy and that the policy is targeted for completion in 2017. What GAO Recommends GAO has made numerous recommendations to VA to improve its management of IT. VA has made progress in implementing GAO's recommendations, but additional actions in the areas of data center consolidation and optimization, as well as incremental system development can better position VA to effectively manage its IT.",
    "gao_GAO-18-414": "Why GAO Did This Study The Bureau's address canvassing operation is a labor-intensive and expensive operation. The Bureau estimates it will need to send 30 percent of addresses to the field for listers to verify. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's address canvassing operation. This report examines (1) the extent to which address canvassers followed procedures, (2) the extent to which the Bureau evaluated workload, productivity rates, and staffing assumptions for address canvassing, and (3) the extent to which the Bureau resolved challenges from the address canvassing test. GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. GAO also observed address canvassing operations at three test sites. What GAO Found The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) completed in-field address canvassing as scheduled by September 29, 2017, canvassing approximately 340,400 addresses. Most of the listers GAO observed generally followed procedures. For example, 15 of 18 listers knocked on doors, and 16 of 18 looked for hidden housing units, which is important for establishing that address lists and maps are accurate and for identifying hard-to-count populations. Those procedures include taking such steps as: comparing the housing units they see on the \"ground\" to the housing units on the address list, knocking on all doors so they could speak with a resident to confirm the address (even if the address is visible on the mailbox or house), and to confirm that there are no other living quarters such as a basement apartment, looking for \"hidden housing units,\" looking for group quarters such as group homes or dormitories, and confirming the location of the housing unit on a map with GPS coordinates collected on the doorstep. To the extent procedures were not followed, it generally occurred when listers did not go up to the door and speak with a resident or take a map spot on the doorstep. Failure to follow procedures could adversely affect a complete count, as addresses could be missed or a group quarter could be misclassified as a residential address. The Bureau conducted tests under census-like conditions, in part, to verify 2020 Census planning assumptions, such as workload, how many houses per hour a lister can verify (also known as a lister's productivity rate), and how many people the Bureau needs to hire for an operation. Moreover, one of the objectives of the test is to validate that the operations being tested are ready at the scale needed for the 2020 Census. For the 2018 End-to-End Test, the Bureau completed in-field address canvassing on time at two sites and early at one site; despite workload increases at all three test sites and hiring shortfalls at two sites. The Bureau credits this success to better than expected productivity. As the Bureau reviews the results of address canvassing, evaluating the factors that affected workload, productivity rates, and staffing and making adjustments to its estimates, if necessary, before the 2020 Census would help the Bureau ensure that address canvassing has the appropriate number of staff and equipment to complete the work in the required time frame. The Bureau does not have procedures to ensure all collected address canvassing data are retained. During the test, 11 out of 330 laptop computers did not properly transmit address and map data collected for 25 blocks. The Bureau officials told GAO that they knew there was a problem with the software used to update the Bureau's address lists and maps. Specifically, address and map updates would not always transfer when a lister transmitted their completed work assignments from the laptop to headquarters. Other census surveys using the same software had also encountered the same software problem. Moreover, listers were not aware that data had not transmitted because there was no system-generated warning. Bureau officials told GAO they recognize the importance of following procedures to monitor alert reports, and acknowledge that the loss of data on seven of the laptops may have been avoided had the procedures that alert reports get triggered and monitored been followed; however, officials did not know why the procedures that required an alert report get triggered and monitored were not followed. Standards for Internal Control call for organizations to safeguard data and follow policies and procedures to achieve their objectives. Thus, either fixing the software problem, or if the software problem cannot be fixed, then determining and addressing why procedures that alert reports get triggered and monitored were not followed would position the Bureau to help prevent future data losses. The Bureau has taken significant steps to use technology to reduce census costs, such as using electronic systems to transmit listers' assignments and address and map data. However, during the address canvassing test, several listers and census field staff experienced problems with Internet connections primarily during training. The Bureau officials stated that the Bureau plans to provide instructions to field staff on what to do if they are unable to access the Internet and what constitutes a",
    "gao_GAO-19-83": "Why GAO Did This Study The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for approving or granting orphan designations to drugs that are intended to treat fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. The agency also provides incentives to drug manufacturers to develop drugs that meet orphan designation criteria. GAO was asked to review FDA's orphan drug program. This report examines (1) the status of FDA's orphan drug modernization plan, (2) FDA's orphan drug marketing approvals, and (3) the extent to which FDA has addressed ongoing or ongoing rare disease drug development challenges. GAO reviewed FDA data on orphan designations from 2008 to 2017, reviewed FDA guidance and training, and interviewed FDA officials and stakeholders. GAO also interviewed stakeholders and research from industry, patient advocacy groups, and other organizations. What GAO Found In June 2017, FDA issued its Orphan Drug Modernization Plan and has implemented a number of steps to address the demand for orphan designations. The number of new orphan designation applications received grew from 185 in 2008 to 527 in 2017 (an increase of 185 percent), while the number of designations granted also grew during the same period. Prior to implementing the modernization plan, OOPD had amassed a backlog of 138 applications that were pending review for more than 120 days. The modernization plan outlined seven actions FDA planned to take to temporarily increase OOPD resources for reviewing designation applications. As a result of these efforts, FDA cleared the application backlog by August 28, 2017, nearly a month ahead of its goal. To accomplish its second goal of reviewing new designation applications within 90 days of receipt, the modernization plan outlined eight steps the agency planned to take to improve the efficiency of its application review process. For example, OOPD implemented a standard review template in October 2017 that outlines information that reviewers are supposed to record, as applicable, from each application and evaluate when making a designation decision\u2014namely, the (1) background information, (2) clinical superiority analysis, (3) orphan subset analysis, (4) population estimate, and (5) scientific rationale that the drug may effectively treat the disease. FDA generally applies consistent criteria when determining whether to grant a drug orphan status, but reviews do not include complete information. GAO found that FDA generally applies consistent criteria when determining whether to grant orphan designation. For example, OOPD requires reviewers to record background information, including elements of the regulatory history of the drug (e.g., U.S. and foreign marketing history), and previous orphan designations for both the drug and the disease. However, GAO found that FDA's guidance does not provide instructions on how to use this information when evaluating the applications. Without instructions on how to use the background information required in its review templates, OOPD reviewers may not consistently use all of the information needed to conduct a complete evaluation of a designation application. Additionally, OOPD instructs its reviewers to consider evidence found in independent sources to verify the population estimate provided in a designation application. However, in 23 of 148 OOPD review templates, reviewers did not include the results of any such independent verification in their evaluation of the manufacturer's population estimate. Without instructions on how to use the background information required in its review templates, OOPD reviewers may not consistently use all of the information needed to conduct a complete evaluation of a designation application. FDA approved 351 orphan drugs for marketing from 2008 to 2017, and have accounted for an increasing proportion of all FDA marketing approvals. Orphan drug marketing approvals also vary by certain characteristics, but were typically in one of two therapeutic areas and required about 9 months for FDA review, among other commonalities. FDA has developed guidance and training to better inform its reviewers and the public about ongoing or ongoing rare disease drug development challenges. For example, FDA published draft guidance for industry in August 2015 on common issues in rare disease drug development, as well as the agency's marketing approval process as it applies to orphan drugs. FDA also offered training to its reviewers. Stakeholders GAO interviewed, including industry experts and patient advocacy groups, and research GAO reviewed identified general rare disease drug development challenges, as well as more specific concerns pertaining to the orphan drug tax credit (ODA) incentives and pricing. However, opinions of some of the concerns attributed to the ODA incentives varied among stakeholders. For example, some stakeholders cited the need for more basic scientific research (e.g., understanding patient experiences and progression of symptoms, known as a disease's natural history), and the difficulty in recruiting small populations for clinical trials. Stakeholders also noted non-ODA drivers of orphan drug growth, including the ability to command high prices and advances in scientific discovery for some rare diseases. However, stakeholders GAO interviewed and",
    "gao_GAO-18-397T": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Border Patrol is responsible for securing the U.S. southwest border, which includes the border between Arizona and Texas. The Border Patrol has deployed surveillance technology, such as cameras, to help detect illegal entrants. In January 2017, the Border Patrol issued an executive order to hire 5,000 additional agents, subject to available appropriations. This statement addresses (1) the progress the Border Patrol has made deploying surveillance technology along the southwest border, (2) the extent to which the Border Patrol has assessed the contribution of fencing to border security operations, and (3) the extent to which the Border Patrol has assessed the impact of existing fencing on border security operations. This statement is based on GAO products issued from 2011 through 2017 and selected updates conducted in February 2017. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has made progress deploying surveillance technology along the southwest border, but has not fully assessed the effectiveness of these technologies. In November 2017, GAO reported that the Border Patrol had completed deployments of all planned Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS), Mobile Surveillance Capability systems, and Unattended Ground Sensors, as well as 15 of 53 Integrated Fixed Tower systems to Arizona. The Border Patrol had also completed deployments of select technologies to Texas and California, including deploying 32 Mobile Surveillance Capability systems. In addition, the Border Patrol had efforts underway to deploy other technology programs, but at the time of GAO's report, some of those programs had not yet begun deployment or were not yet under contract. For example, GAO reported in November 2017 that the Border Patrol had not yet initiated deployments of RVSS to Texas because, according to Border Patrol officials, the program had only recently completed contract negotiations for procuring those systems. GAO also reported in November 2017 that the Border Patrol had made progress identifying performance metrics for the technologies deployed along the southwest border, but additional actions are needed to fully implement GAO's prior recommendations in this area. For example, in March 2014, GAO reported that CBP had identified mission benefits of its surveillance technologies to be deployed along the southwest border, such as improved situational awareness and agent safety. However, the agency had not developed key attributes for performance metrics for all surveillance technologies to be deployed. Further, GAO reported in March 2014 that CBP did not capture complete data on the contributions of these technologies. When used in combination with other relevant performance metrics or indicators, these data could be used to better determine the impact of CBP's surveillance technologies on CBP's border security efforts and inform resource allocation decisions. Therefore, GAO recommended that CBP (1) require data on technology contributions to apprehensions or seizures to be tracked and recorded within its database and (2) subsequently analyze available data on apprehensions and technological assists\u2014in combination with other relevant performance metrics or indicators, as appropriate\u2014to determine the contribution of surveillance technologies. CBP concurred with GAO's recommendations and has implemented one of them. Specifically, in June 2014, the Border Patrol issued guidance informing agents that the asset assist data field\u2014which records assisting technology or other assets (canine teams)\u2014in its database had become a mandatory data field. While the Border Patrol has taken action to collect data on technology, it has not taken additional steps to determine the contribution of surveillance technologies to CBP's border security efforts. GAO has reported on the significant investments CBP has made in tactical infrastructure along the southwest border. From fiscal years 2005 through 2015, CBP increased the total miles of primary border fencing on the southwest border from 119 miles to 654 miles\u2014including 354 miles of primary pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of primary vehicle fencing. In addition, CBP has deployed additional layers of pedestrian fencing behind the primary border fencing, including 37 miles of secondary fencing. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, CBP spent approximately $2.4 billion on tactical infrastructure on the southwestern border\u2014and about 95 percent, or around $2.3 billion, was spent on constructing pedestrian and vehicle fencing. CBP officials reported it will need to spend additional amounts to sustain these investments over their lifetimes. In February 2017, GAO reported that border fencing had benefited border security operations in various ways, according to the Border Patrol. For example, according to officials, border fencing improved agent safety, helped reduce vehicle incursions, and supported Border Patrol agents' ability to respond to illicit cross-border activities by slowing the progress of illegal entrants. However, GAO also found that, despite its investments over the years, CBP could not measure the contribution of fencing to border security operations along the southwest border because it had not developed metrics for this assessment. GAO recommended in February 2017 that the Border Patrol develop metrics to assess the contributions",
    "gao_GAO-18-21": "Why GAO Did This Study Duty-free stores located along the U.S.-Mexico border are regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Duty-free stores are not subject to U.S. tax laws. GAO was asked to review duty-free cigarette exports. This report examines (1) requirements that govern the lawful sale and export of cigarettes from duty-free stores on the southwest border and schemes for illicit trade in such cigarettes that agencies identified, (2) U.S. agency observations about these duty-free cigarette exports and efforts to counter illicit trade, and (3) the extent to which selected cigarette transaction data submitted by duty-free stores indicate compliance issues with reporting requirements. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, analyzed export data from 2010 through 2015, and interviewed U.S. and Mexican agency officials. What GAO Found Duty-free stores may sell tax-exempt cigarettes in any quantity to passengers departing the United States for Mexico at a port on the land border; agencies have identified schemes and practices associated with duty-free sales that are used to evade U.S. and Mexican taxes. U.S. regulations require duty-free stores to have procedures to provide reasonable assurance that duty-free merchandise sold will be exported and require the exporter to report information on the export of commercial cargo, which CBP considers to be transactions valued at more than $2,500. Census data indicate that about 18,500 such transactions occurred from 2010 through 2015 at duty-free stores on the southwest border. According to information from CBP and a Mexican customs official, Mexican requirements dictate that, depending on place of residence, some adult travelers to Mexico can bring in one carton of cigarettes tax-exempt, and some residents can bring in an additional three cartons if they pay taxes on them. Bringing in any quantity above four cartons would require an individual to register as an importer with the Mexican government, according to the same Mexican official. U.S. agencies identified three schemes used to evade cigarette-related taxes and other legal requirements in the United States and Mexico: (1) diverting cigarettes from the store directly into U.S. commerce; (2) smuggling duty-free cigarettes into Mexico through U.S. ports of entry by concealing them, while potentially also bribing Mexican customs officials to evade payment of Mexican taxes; and (3) smuggling duty-free cigarettes back into the United States after first smuggling them into Mexico. U.S. agency officials said that some smuggling of duty-free cigarettes across the southwest border has links to organized crime, supplies the illicit tobacco market in Mexico, and poses oversight challenges. ICE officials said that transnational criminal organizations use smuggled, duty-free cigarettes to launder money and generate revenue. Furthermore, a Mexican customs official noted that relatively inexpensive cigarettes manufactured in the United States, which cannot legally be sold in the United States or in Mexico, are routinely sold for export from duty-free stores on the southwest border; such cigarettes are then smuggled across to supply Mexico's illicit tobacco market. One brand of such cigarettes has been cited in recent studies as a significant part of the illicit tobacco trade in Mexico. U.S. agency officials said that their efforts to counter the illicit movement of duty-free cigarettes face challenges related to the purchaser's ability to buy duty-free cigarettes in unlimited quantities and to use passenger, not commercial, crossings from the United States into Mexico. According to U.S. officials, while U.S. agencies do not have the authority to seize exports that violate Mexico's laws related to these cigarettes, U.S. officials reported working with Mexican officials on activities to enforce the customs laws and regulations of both countries. CBP has taken some steps to address compliance concerns with one duty-free store operator, but other possible actions remain, including the issuance of final instructions and guidance to all duty-free store operators on the border and the public. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CBP take steps to strengthen compliance with export reporting requirements related to duty-free cigarette sales on the southwest border. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-167": "Why GAO Did This Study The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is responsible for overseeing the SNAP program, which provides food to millions of low-income households. FNS estimates the extent of trafficking in SNAP benefits, which is a form of fraud. GAO was asked to review FNS's efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to retailer trafficking. This report examines (1) the extent of retailer trafficking in SNAP and (2) steps FNS has taken to address retailer trafficking. GAO reviewed FNS data on trafficking and interviewed FNS officials. GAO also reviewed FNS's policies and procedures for authorizing and monitoring stores. What GAO Found FNS's data indicate an increase in the estimated rate of retailer trafficking in recent years. FNS reported in March 2011 that approximately $330 million in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits were trafficked annually from 2006 through 2008, and that approximately 8.2 percent of all authorized stores engaged in trafficking. In its most recent report from September 2017, FNS reported that approximately $1 billion in SNAP benefits were trafficked annually from 2012 through 2014, and that approximately 11.8 percent of all authorized stores engaged in trafficking. Although FNS produces the trafficking estimates with accepted statistical methods, its reports do not clearly convey the level of uncertainty introduced by the approach used to calculate the estimates. Throughout each report, FNS presents its estimates as precise numbers. However, uncertainty is introduced when extrapolating from a smaller sample\u2014in this case, an investigative sample that solely includes stores known to have trafficked or suspected of trafficking\u2014to the full population of SNAP-authorized stores because the extent to which the sample reflects the broader population of stores is unknown. According to the Office of Management and Budget's statistical standards for federal agencies, possible variation in estimates should be noted, such as by reporting the range of each estimate. FNS officials stated the agency has not considered and does not intend to consider changes to how it reports its trafficking estimates in the next report. FNS has acknowledged limitations with its current approach to estimating retailer trafficking and evaluated ways to address some of those limitations. For example, FNS has not evaluated whether the factors used to identify stores for possible investigation could help reduce bias in the sample and improve the trafficking estimates. FNS officials said that they do not believe there are available data that indicate whether the assumption is accurate and, as such, any evaluation would require new data collection. However, according to contractors and a former official who had studied the methodology as well as USDA Office of Inspector General officials, data are currently available that may help FNS evaluate the accuracy of this assumption. Without evaluating the usefulness of the Watch List factors for adjusting the sample, FNS may miss an opportunity to reduce the bias in the sample and improve the accuracy of its trafficking estimates. FNS has taken some steps to prevent retailer trafficking that align with leading fraud risk management practices and GAO's prior recommendations, but has not pursued some opportunities for early oversight. For example, FNS has taken steps to improve how it detects retailer trafficking, such as increasing requirements for food that retailers must stock to participate in SNAP. However, FNS has not pursued some opportunities for early oversight. For example, FNS has not assessed retailer risk levels, which are key to preventing trafficking. Considering the benefits and costs of control activities to address identified risks is a leading practice in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. By not assessing the benefits and costs of reauthorizing certain high-risk stores more frequently than other stores, FNS may be missing an opportunity to provide early oversight of risky stores and prevent trafficking. FNS measures the effectiveness of many of its trafficking detection and response activities, but lacks measures to evaluate its prevention activities. For example, FNS's Retailer Operations Division has an internal scorecard that tracks performance measures related to retailer oversight activities, but none of these focuses on prevention of trafficking. FNS officials said that they have not considered establishing measures related to preventing trafficking. FNS officials acknowledged that these data could be used to develop performance measures for its trafficking prevention activities. Establishing such measures would enable FNS to more fully assess the effectiveness of its retailer oversight activities and better balance retailer access to the program with those to prevent retailer fraud. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FNS (1) evaluate the usefulness of the Watch List factors for adjusting the sample, (2) assess the benefits and costs of reauthorizing a sample of high-risk stores more frequently than other stores, and (3) assess the benefits and costs of reauthorizing a sample of high-risk stores more frequently than other stores. FNS generally agreed with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-256": "Why GAO Did This Study RFA requires agencies to analyze the impact of proposed rules on small entities and consider any significant regulatory alternatives that will achieve statutory objectives while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. RFA also requires GAO to review the implementation of RFA. This report examines (1) the extent to which RFA requirements apply to recent rules and the extent to which regulators certify that these rules would not have a significant economic impact on small entities and (2) the extent to which regulators have evaluated the potential economic effects of proposed rules and the extent to which they have documented the analyses. GAO reviewed RFA requirements and regulations, analyzed certifications and regulatory flexibility analyses, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Financial Regulations Act (FRA) requires that federal agencies, including the financial regulators, analyze the impact of proposed rules on small entities and consider any significant regulatory alternatives that will achieve statutory objectives while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. RFA requires that agencies assess the impact of proposed rules on small entities and consider any significant regulatory alternatives that will achieve statutory objectives while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. GAO found that many of the 316 rules subject to RFA requirements from 2010 through 2016 were not subject to RFA requirements. The regulators generally certified that most would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. However, the frequency with which individual regulators certified varied. For example, the Federal Reserve most frequently performed some RFA analyses in these rules, although such analyses were not required. GAO found that the factual basis provided for most certifications lacked key information (discussions of data sources or methodologies and of broader economic impacts, or definitions for key criteria) for understanding the analyses regulators used to support their conclusion. GAO also found that while most agencies relied on the Small Business Administration's definitions of small entities for use in their RFA analyses, two agencies relied on alternative definitions of small entities, some of which have not been updated in more than 35 years. GAO found that the factual basis provided for most certifications lacked key information (discussions of data sources or methodologies and of broader economic impacts, or definitions for key criteria) for understanding the analyses regulators used to support their conclusion. GAO also found that the regulators' guidance for complying with RFA generally does not include policies and procedures for helping to ensure consistent and complete RFA analyses. Without policies and procedures that would help ensure that key components were incorporated in certification assessments\u2014including disclosing the methodology and data sources of economic analyses and considering potential broad economic impacts\u2014regulators may be limiting the effectiveness of their reviews. In turn, such reviews hinder the achievement of RFA's goal. For example, incomplete disclosure of methodology and data sources could limit the public and affected entities' ability to offer informed comments in response to regulators' certification assessments in proposed rules. Many recent regulatory flexibility analyses had weaknesses. Many final rules described changes to limit burden, and few regulatory flexibility analyses concluded rules would have a significant impact on small entities. For most rules GAO reviewed, regulators were unable to provide documentation supporting their regulatory flexibility analyses. Moreover, regulators generally lacked comprehensive policies and procedures for RFA implementation, a potential contributing factor for many of the weaknesses GAO identified. By developing policies and procedures that provide specific direction to rulemaking staff, the regulators could better ensure consistent and complete implementation of RFA requirements and more fully realize the RFA goal of appropriately considering and minimizing impacts on small entities during and after agency rulemakings. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Financial Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) develop and implement specific policies and procedures for how it will consistently comply with RFA requirements and key aspects of Office of Advocacy guidance. FDIC agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-605": "Why GAO Did This Study The Air Force has a fleet of 82 HH-60G Pave Hawks designated to meet its personnel recovery mission requirements. The Air Force has also designated 14 HH-60Gs for training and, development and testing. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force to study the Air Force's structure and recommend modifications. The National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force issued its final report in January 2014. The Air Force agreed with 41 of the 42 recommendations. GAO was asked to review the Air Force's HH-60G fleet. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Air Force's HH-60Gs have experienced declines in condition and maintenance challenges, and (2) the extent to which the Air Force fielded its new Combat Rescue Helicopters. GAO reviewed the Air Force's inventory of HH-60Gs and maintenance data for fiscal years 2013-2017, and interviewed Air Force officials. GAO also reviewed the Air Force's Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule. What GAO Found The material condition of the Air Force's HH-60G fleet has declined and maintenance challenges have increased, in part due to extensions beyond the initially designed service life of the helicopters. In November 2017, the Air Force's HH-60Gs were about 5 percent below their desired \u201cmission capable\u201d rate of 75 percent, which refers to the material condition of a squadron's possessed aircraft and their abilities to conduct their designed missions. Mission capable rates have shown some year-to-year fluctuations, without any clear trends. However, for each of the past 5 years, the helicopters' mission capable rates have been below the Air Force's goal, and for fiscal year 2017, 68 percent of the 96 helicopter fleet were mission capable. As the helicopters have aged, the amount of time spent conducting maintenance on them has increased. For example, according to Air Force officials, in fiscal year 2013 the fleet averaged about 21 maintenance manhours for every HH-60G flight hour. However, by fiscal year 2017, the maintenance time spent had increased to an average of more than 25 maintenance manhours for every flight hour. According to Air Force officials, these structural and major component failures can require time-consuming maintenance that negatively affects availability and mission capable rates. The Air Force fielded its new Combat Rescue Helicopters first to high flight-hour squadrons. The Air Force Reserve is scheduled to receive its new helicopters beginning in fiscal year 2026. The Air National Guard is scheduled to receive refurbished Operational Loss Replacement helicopters in fiscal year 2019 and the new Combat Rescue Helicopters beginning in fiscal year 2027. The last Combat Rescue Helicopters are scheduled to be fielded to all three components in fiscal year 2029. The Air Force has identified potential training challenges, but would likely incur costs if it adjusted the fielding schedule for its Combat Rescue Helicopters. The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard did not concur with the Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule. Reserve Component officials said they did not concur, in part, because the Air Force did not coordinate the fielding schedule prior to the contract's approval in 2014. However, according to Air Force officials, the Combat Rescue Helicopter fielding schedule was coordinated with and approved by all components prior to the 2014 contract being approved. Further, Air Force officials stated they plan to maintain the fielding schedule because changing it would require the renegotiation of the contract and would likely result in increased costs and possibly a delay in delivery of the new helicopters. Air Force officials acknowledge that based on the current fielding schedule there is a potential training gap that will occur in fiscal years 2025 through 2028 when the formal training units will no longer have any HH-60Gs available to train the reserve component. As of June 2018, Air Force officials said they were considering a number of options to address future training issues, including the following: The Air Force would provide legacy HH-60G helicopters, for a limited time, to the Air National Guard squadron at Kirtland Air Force Base. This would allow the Air National Guard to continue providing initial and requalification training on the legacy HH-60G helicopters for several years after the active component portion of the formal training unit at Kirtland Air Force Base has divested its legacy HH-60G helicopters. The Air Force would require personnel that have completed training on the Combat Rescue Helicopter at Kirtland Air Force Base to then receive additional training for the legacy platform at their home stations if their squadrons are still flying the HH-60Gs. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. DOD had no comments",
    "gao_GAO-18-607": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid, a federal-state health care program, covered an estimated 72.2 million low-income and medically needy individuals in 2016. PPACA permitted states to expand Medicaid eligibility to a new population\u2014non-elderly, non-pregnant adults who are not eligible for Medicare and whose income does not exceed 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). PPACA also permitted states to expand Medicaid eligibility to a new population\u2014non-elderly, non-pregnant adults who are not eligible for Medicare and whose income does not exceed 138 percent of the FPL. GAO was asked to describe (1) the number and demographic characteristics of uninsured, low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states; (2) unmet medical needs for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status; (3) barriers to health care for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status; and (4) having a usual place of care and receiving selected health care services for low-income adults in expansion and non-expansion states and by insurance status. GAO analyzed data from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which was the most recent available when GAO conducted its analyses. GAO also interviewed officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). What GAO Found According to the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 5.6 million low-income adults were uninsured in 2016. Of these 5.6 million, an estimated 1.9 million uninsured, low-income adults resided in expansion states, compared with an estimated 3.7 million in non-expansion states. Estimates of uninsured, low-income adults comprised less than 1 percent of the total population for all expansion states and 3 percent of the total population for all non-expansion states. Estimates of uninsured, low-income adults comprised less than 1 percent of the total population for all expansion states and 3 percent of the total population for all non-expansion states. Estimates of unmet medical needs showed that smaller percentages of low-income adults in expansion states reported having any unmet medical needs compared with those in non-expansion states; and smaller percentages of those who were insured reported having any unmet medical needs compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that smaller percentages of low-income adults in expansion states reported financial barriers to needed health care compared with those in non-expansion states; and smaller percentages of those who were insured reported financial barriers to needed health care compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that a larger percentage of low-income adults in expansion states reported having a usual place of care compared with those in non-expansion states; and larger percentages of those who were insured reported having a usual place of care compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived. The 2016 NHIS estimates showed that larger percentages of low-income adults in expansion states reported receiving selected health care services, such as a flu vaccine, compared with those in non-expansion states; and larger percentages of those with insurance reported receiving selected health care services compared with those who were uninsured, regardless of where they lived. The 2016 NHIS also asked respondents whether they visited or had spoken to a health care professional about their health, including: a general practitioner, family doctor, or a nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or midwife; and a doctor who specializes in a particular disease, with the exception of obstetricians, gynecologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists.",
    "gao_GAO-18-60": "Why GAO Did This Study Offshore seismic surveys provide federal agencies and commercial entities with a wide range of information, including data on fault zones and geology that may indicate the presence of oil and gas. This information can help inform regulatory and resource development decisions. BOEM, NMFS, and FWS review applications for permits and authorizations related to seismic surveys in each of the four OCS regions. GAO was asked to review BOEM's process for reviewing seismic survey permit applications. This report examines (1) BOEM's process for reviewing seismic survey permit applications in each OCS region, the number of applications reviewed from 2011 through 2016, and BOEM's review time frames; (2) NMFS's and FWS's processes for reviewing incidental authorization applications related to seismic surveys in each OCS region, the number of such applications reviewed by the agencies from 2011 through 2016, and their review time frames; and (3) the status of pending seismic survey permit applications and related incidental take authorizations in the Atlantic OCS region. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, agency guidance, and agency documents, and interviewed agency officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has a documented process for reviewing seismic survey applications in each of the three selected Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) regions that differ at the final step. BOEM generally submits an application to BOEM for a seismic survey permit at the same time that the applicant submits an application to NMFS or FWS for an incidental take authorization. For the Gulf of Mexico region, BOEM generally issues permits without requiring incidental take authorizations to be in place. BOEM's process for reviewing seismic survey permit applications differs by OCS region. BOEM generally issues permits without requiring incidental take authorizations to be in place. NMFS and FWS follow a similar application review process for reviewing incidental authorization applications, and from 2011 through 2016, the agencies reviewed a total of 35 applications. However, neither agency was able to provide accurate data for the dates on which it began its formal processing of these applications because neither agency's guidance sufficiently describes how to record certain review dates. As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the agencies were meeting their statutory time frames for the type of incidental take authorization application that has such time frames\u2014the incidental harassment authorizations. NMFS and FWS have been reviewing certain seismic survey permit and incidental take authorization applications in the Atlantic OCS region for several years. From 2011 through 2016, BOEM received six applications for seismic survey permits in the Atlantic region. Of the six applications, five also applied to NMFS for incidental harassment authorizations related to their seismic survey permit applications, from August 2014 to January 2016. The sixth applicant that applied to BOEM for a seismic survey permit in the Atlantic OCS region did not apply for an incidental harassment authorization with NMFS. NMFS officials told GAO that they did not issue the seismic survey permits because it had made a policy decision to wait for NMFS to issue incidental harassment authorizations before doing so. In January 2017, BOEM denied the six applications for deep-penetration seismic survey permits in the Atlantic OCS region after reviewing the applications for 948 to 982 days. In May 2017, BOEM announced it would reconsider the six applications for seismic survey permits in the Atlantic region, after the new administration rescinded the permit denials. As of August 2017, BOEM officials were unable to provide estimates of when the agency's reviews would be completed. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that BOEM and FWS develop guidance that clarifies how and when staff should record the date on which the agency determines the \"adequacy and completeness\" of an application. NMFS and FWS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-289": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy is the first military department to assert audit readiness for its real property. GAO was asked to review the Navy's audit readiness. This report (1) determines the extent to which the Navy had internal control deficiencies, if any, that may impair its ability to assert that its buildings, as reported in its financial statements, exist and that the information about the buildings is complete and adequately supported by property records and (2) identifies the challenges, if any, that the Navy faces in valuing its buildings in accordance with federal accounting standards. GAO reviewed relevant documentation, including Navy procedures and related control activities, and interviewed Navy officials. GAO also conducted site visits to selected buildings at 10 Navy installations. What GAO Found GAO identified internal control deficiencies that impaired the Navy's ability to assert that as of September 30, 2016, (1) buildings recorded in the Navy's accountable real property system (iNFADS) and reported as assets in Navy's financial statements existed and (2) all of the Navy's buildings were recorded in iNFADS and correctly reported as assets in Navy's financial statements. The effects of these internal control deficiencies contributed to the Navy (1) continuing to maintain records in iNFADS for buildings that had been demolished, sometimes many years ago, and including these buildings as assets in its financial statements; (2) excluding some of the buildings that it owns from being recorded in iNFADS and reported as assets in its financial statements; (3) erroneously reporting nonfunctional buildings as assets in its financial statements; and (4) excluding certain buildings from being reported as assets in its financial statements that met or exceeded DOD's capitalization threshold. The Navy faces several challenges in valuing its buildings in accordance with federal accounting standards, including (1) finalizing documentation of actual cost information for buildings that are acquired and placed in service after the Navy's opening balances have been established based on alternative valuation methods permitted by SFFAS No. 50; (2) capturing and recording costs of improvements that should be reported; (3) consistently completing asset evaluations for each building every 5 years as required by DOD Instruction 4165.14 to help ensure that each building's information in iNFADS is correct; and (4) determining placed in service dates for previously unrecorded buildings that are subsequently discovered/identified through physical inventories/asset evaluations. Navy officials are aware of these challenges and have various efforts under way to address them. Effective implementation of these efforts is crucial to help address these challenges. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Navy develop and implement procedures and related control activities to reasonably assure that demolished buildings are recorded as disposed and removed from the accounting records. The Navy concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-635": "Why GAO Did This Study The Bureau estimates the cost of the 2020 Census to be $12.3 billion, an increase of 27 percent over the estimated $12.3 billion in 2015. The Bureau's latest estimate, announced in October 2017, reflects the same design, but at an expected cost of $15.6 billion. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's cost estimates. This report evaluates (1) the extent to which the Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate and associated guidance met GAO's best practices for cost estimation and (2) compared the 2015 and 2017 life-cycle cost estimates to describe key drivers of cost growth. GAO analyzed the Bureau's cost estimates against best practices and interviewed Bureau and Department of Commerce officials. What GAO Found The Census Bureau (Bureau) has made significant progress in developing its life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census. For example, the Bureau has put into place a work breakdown structure (WBS) that defines the work, products, activities, and resources necessary to accomplish the 2020 Census and is standardized for use in budget planning, operational planning, and cost estimation. However, the Bureau's October 2017 cost estimate for the 2020 Census does not fully reflect characteristics of a high-quality estimate as described in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and cannot be considered reliable. GAO found the Bureau met or substantially met three out of the four characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, while it partially met one characteristic: well-documented. The Bureau's estimate was not overly optimistic; appeared to be free of errors; was based on historical data or input from subject matter experts; and, according to Bureau officials, is updated regularly as information becomes available. The Bureau can enhance the accuracy of their estimate by increasing the level of detail included in the documentation, such as detail on specific inflation indices used, and by monitoring actual costs against estimates. The Bureau's cost estimate substantially met the criteria for credible, which is the ability to control for uncertainties and control for them by identifying and quantifying cost elements that represent the most risk. The Bureau's cost estimate clearly identifies risks and uncertainties, and describes approaches taken to mitigate them. The Bureau's cost estimate is used by management to inform decisions about program resources and to effectively measure progress against operational objectives. The Bureau's cost estimate serves as a tool for program development and oversight, supporting management to make informed decisions. The Bureau's cost estimate is used to examine the cost impact of program changes. The Bureau's latest cost estimate, announced in October 2017, reflects the same design, but at an expected cost of $15.6 billion. The largest increases occurred in the Response, Managerial Contingency, and Census/Survey Engineering categories. Increased costs of $1.3 billion in the response category (costs related to collecting, maintaining, and processing survey response data) were in part due to reduced assumptions for self-response rates, leading to increases in the amount of data collected in the field, which is more costly to the Bureau. Contingency allocations increased overall from $1.35 billion in 2015 to $2.6 billion in 2017, as the Bureau gained a greater understanding of risks facing the 2020 Census. Increases of $838 million in the Census/Survey Engineering category were due mainly to the cost of an IT contract for integrating decennial survey systems that was not included in the 2015 cost estimate. Bureau officials attribute a decrease of $551 million in estimated costs for Program Management to changes in the categorization of costs associated with risks: In the 2017 version of the estimate, estimated costs related to program risks were allocated to their corresponding WBS element. More generally, factors that contributed to cost fluctuations between the 2015 and 2017 cost estimates include: changes in assumptions for census operations, improved ability to anticipate and quantify risk, an overall increase in information technology (IT) costs, and more defined contract requirements. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations to the Bureau in this report. The Bureau agreed with GAO's findings regarding the improvements the Bureau has made in its cost estimates. However, Commerce did not agree with GAO's assessment that the Bureau's 2017 lifecycle cost estimate is \"not reliable.\" Commerce noted that it had conducted two independent cost analyses and was satisfied that the cost estimate was reliable. The Bureau also provided technical comments that GAO incorporated, as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-698": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS collects millions of dollars in whistleblower awards each year to help identify tax fraud and abuse. In fiscal year 2017, IRS paid out $34 million on 367 claims. In February 2018, the statutory change to include FBAR penalties in whistleblower awards was enacted. GAO was asked to review the whistleblower program. This report examines (1) the extent to which IRS included FBAR penalties in whistleblower awards prior to the statutory change; (2) how IRS used whistleblower information on FBAR noncompliance and how IRS responded to the statutory change in definition of proceeds; (3) the purposes for which IRS collects and uses data from the FBAR Database and assesses the controls for ensuring data reliability; and (4) what is known about the potential effect exclusions from collected proceeds, including FBAR penalties, may have on whistleblowers bringing claims to IRS. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials and whistleblower attorneys. GAO also reviewed a stratified sample of closed 7623(b) claims closed between January 1, 2012, and July 24, 2017. GAO also interviewed 11 attorneys representing whistleblowers who have filed claims with IRS. What GAO Found Prior to February 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not consider whistleblower information that may have led to FBAR enforcement actions in award determinations. IRS assessed approximately $10.7 million in FBAR penalties to taxpayers who were identified in GAO's sample of whistleblower claims. GAO reviewed 92 whistleblower claims closed between January 1, 2012, and July 24, 2017, where the identified taxpayer was also subject to an IRS FBAR examination. IRS assessed FBAR penalties in 28 of these 92 cases. In none of these instances was the FBAR penalty included in the collected proceeds used to calculate whistleblower awards. GAO's analysis of these 28 claims suggests that if IRS had included FBAR penalties in the awards, the whistleblowers involved could have received an additional $1.6 million to $3.2 million, assuming an award of between 15 and 30 percent. IRS historically used FBAR information from whistleblower claims for enforcement efforts, but the statutory change in award basis increases the importance of reporting full information. IRS has taken some steps to communicate change in whistleblower award basis. For example, IRS issued guidance on how to review claims for non-Title 26 issues, but the guidance had not been updated to reflect the new law. IRS uses its FBAR Database for internal and external reporting but lacks sufficient controls for the reliability of FBAR penalty data. GAO found that the data fields GAO used were sufficiently reliable for its purposes. For example, GAO matched taxpayer identification numbers in the FBAR Database to those in IRS's Electronic Tax Accounts Tracking (E-TRAK) database and reported on enforcement outcomes, including a limited number of penalty payments. However, GAO found certain elements of the database to have limited reliability. For example, GAO found 44 records with input errors in this field. Because the FBAR data lack some reliability controls, IRS may rely on insufficient or incomplete data for reporting and decision making, including amounts of whistleblower awards. Whistleblower attorneys GAO spoke with referred to the former exclusion for FBAR and other non-Title 26 collections from whistleblower awards as a significant concern for them and their clients. These attorneys cited other concerns with the program that could continue to limit their willingness to represent tax whistleblowers and discourage whistleblowers. These concerns included limits on anonymity for whistleblowers appealing IRS award determinations; restrictions on filing claims anonymously; delays in award payments during the lengthy appeals process; and limited communication with the Whistleblower Office during the claim review process. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS (1) update its guidance on how to document how whistleblower information was used in any IRS actions taken, regardless of whether the laws administered, examined, or enforced are outside of Title 26, such as FBAR penalties; (2) improve controls for the validity, completeness, and accuracy of data on FBAR exams and enforcement actions; and (3) improve controls for the validity, completeness, and accuracy of data on FBAR exams and enforcement actions. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-538": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS is responsible for ensuring the security of the nation's chemical infrastructure by identifying high-risk chemical facilities, assessing the risk posed by them, and requiring the implementation of measures to protect them. DHS issued regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for chemical facilities that, as determined by DHS, present high levels of risk. GAO was asked to review DHS's CFATS program. This report examines (1) DHS's actions to strengthen its processes for identifying high-risk chemical facilities and (2) the extent to which DHS has taken actions to ensure that first responders and emergency planners have the information needed to prepare for and respond to incidents at high-risk chemical facilities. GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials and representatives from 11 industry associations representing facilities covered by CFATS and considered high-risk. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Infrastructure Protection (ISCD) has taken action to strengthen its processes for identifying high-risk chemical facilities. In response to GAO's July 2015 report, ISCD implemented a new methodology to identify high-risk facilities and assign them a risk-based tier. In addition, ISCD revised its risk assessment methodology to more accurately identify and assign high-risk chemical facilities to tiers. ISCD has nearly completed its efforts to apply this new methodology to facilities covered by the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. ISCD has conducted an increased number of compliance inspections and continues to make changes to improve the efficiency of the inspection process. However, GAO found that ISCD's methodology and resulting performance metric do not reflect the program's impact on reducing a facility's vulnerability to an attack. ISCD may have an opportunity to explore how reductions in vulnerability at individual facilities resulting from the CFATS compliance inspection process could be used to develop an overall measure of the performance of the CFATS program in lowering risk and increasing security nationwide. ISCD shares some CFATS information with state and local officials, including access to CFATS facility-specific data via a secure portal; however, this portal is not widely used at the local level by first responders and emergency planners. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS (1) incorporate vulnerability into the CFATS site security scoring methodology to help measure the reduction in the vulnerability of high-risk facilities to a terrorist attack, and use that data in assessing the CFATS program's performance in lowering risk and enhancing national security, and (2) encourage access to and wider use of the IP Gateway and explore other opportunities to improve information-sharing with first responders and emergency planners. DHS concurred with both recommendations and outlined efforts underway or planned to address them.",

The rule also requires that businesses take steps to prevent contamination of sprouts, which have been associated with foodborne illness outbreaks. The rule also requires that businesses take steps to ensure that agricultural water that comes into contact with produce is safe and of adequate sanitary quality for its intended use. GAO was asked to review FDA's implementation of the produce rule. This report examines (1) FDA's efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the rule and (2) FDA's efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the rule. GAO reviewed FDA's information clearinghouse, the TAN, and other documents; interviewed FDA officials; and analyzed TAN responses from businesses and other stakeholders. GAO also interviewed representatives from two produce industry associations, a farming organization, and four organizations working with FDA to implement the produce rule. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has continued to evaluate and respond to business concerns regarding the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2015 (FSMA) produce rule. Since GAO last reported on the rule, FDA has continued to use its information clearinghouse, the TAN, to evaluate and respond to questions and concerns from businesses and other stakeholders regarding the rule. FDA has also taken other steps, including funding training for industry, conducting visits to farms, and publishing guidance, to evaluate and respond to concerns. In addition, FDA is reviewing the produce rule agricultural water standards and in September 2017 published a proposed rule to extend compliance dates associated with those standards. FDA officials said that the agency is considering adding clarifying information on the standards in forthcoming guidance and, if necessary, making changes to the standards themselves by revising the produce rule. FDA has begun collecting survey results to assess the effectiveness of its information clearinghouse, the TAN, and has continued to develop metrics that will assess outcomes related to the agency's overall efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns. In October 2016, FDA implemented the first part of its survey assessing the TAN. This first part of the survey, which FDA sent to businesses and other stakeholders that submitted questions to the TAN, solicited feedback about the TAN web page provided for submitting questions. This survey included questions about how stakeholders learned about the TAN web page, the clarity of the page, and how FDA could improve the page. FDA officials said they have begun making changes to the TAN web page based on the survey results. In addition, FDA is developing the second part of its TAN survey, which will solicit feedback from stakeholders on the timeliness and quality of answers provided by FDA through the TAN. In addition, FDA is continuing to develop metrics intended to assess outcomes related to the agency's overall efforts to evaluate and respond to business concerns. These outcomes are specified in a draft strategic framework the agency has developed to monitor implementation of the produce rule. The framework includes outcomes such as businesses' compliance with the rule, expanded use of incentives for compliance, and increased dissemination of good practices and other on-farm findings. FDA officials said they are working to respond more quickly to TAN questions and are revising the FDA review process for TAN responses. In addition, representatives from four groups GAO interviewed said that businesses need more information from FDA to comply with the produce rule and are awaiting FDA's forthcoming guidance pertaining to the rule. FDA officials said they are aware of businesses' concerns about the need for additional guidance. These officials said they are working to publish guidance on various topics related to the produce rule, as GAO has described elsewhere in this report. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-365": "Why GAO Did This Study FOIA requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to government information. The act also requires agencies to report annually to Justice on their use of statutory exemptions, which include withholding information from the public. GAO was asked to review the implementation of FOIA. This report examines (1) the extent to which agencies have implemented selected FOIA requirements; (2) the methods established by agencies to reduce backlogged requests and the effectiveness of those methods; (3) identifies any statutory (b)(3) exemptions that have been used by agencies as the basis for withholding (redacting) information; and (4) what FOIA requests, if any, agencies received and processed that related to entities that received government assistance during the 2008 financial crisis. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency data; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 18 agencies GAO reviewed had fully implemented half of the six key Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements and the vast majority of agencies implemented two additional requirements. However, 5 agencies published and updated their FOIA regulations in a timely and comprehensive manner. Fully implementing FOIA requirements will better position agencies to provide the public with necessary access to government records and ensure openness in government. The 18 selected agencies had FOIA request backlogs of varying sizes, ranging from no backlogged requests at some agencies to 45,000 or more of requests at other agencies. Generally, the agencies with the largest backlogs had received the most requests. In an effort to aid agencies in reducing their backlogs, Justice's Office of Information Policy (OIP) identified key practices that agencies can use. However, while the agencies reported using these practices and other methods, few of them managed to reduce their backlogs during the period from fiscal year 2012 through 2016. In particular, of the four agencies with the largest backlogs, only one\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014reduced its backlog. Agencies attributed their inability to decrease backlogs to the increased number and complexity of requests, among other factors. However, agencies also lack comprehensive plans to implement practices on an ongoing basis. During fiscal years 2010 to 2016, agencies claimed 237 statutes as the basis for withholding information. Of these statutes, the majority\u2014178\u2014fell into 4 of the 8 categories of information. The remaining 59 statutes were in four categories: internal agency functions and practices, financial regulation, international affairs, and environmental. The number of statutes not having a reference to the statutory exemption is evidence of the OPEN FOIA Act's uneven impact on the establishment of statutory exemptions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission designate a chief FOIA officer at the assistant secretary level or equivalent. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-339SP": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS's mission to safeguard the American people and homeland requires a broad portfolio of acquisitions. However, the performance of DHS's major acquisition portfolio during 2017 did not improve compared to GAO's last review because more programs will require more time and may require more money to complete than initially planned. DHS is collecting more timely cost estimate information on its acquisition programs to make more informed investment decisions. Yet DHS continues to face challenges in funding its acquisition portfolio, which highlights the need for disciplined policies that reflect best practices to ensure that the department does not pursue more programs than it can afford. GAO was asked to review DHS's acquisition management, requirements development, test and evaluation, and resource allocation processes. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS's major acquisition programs were on track to meet schedule and cost goals during 2017 and (2) DHS's policies for managing its acquisition portfolio and the extent to which they reflect key portfolio management practices. GAO reviewed DHS's acquisition management, requirements development, test and evaluation, and resource allocation policies and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found Of the 24 programs GAO assessed with approved schedule and cost goals, 10 were on track to meet those goals during 2017. The other 14 programs were not on track because they changed or breached their schedule goals, cost goals, or both. GAO found that most programs updated their cost estimates in response to requirements DHS established in January 2016 that are intended to provide decision makers with more timely information. These actions are in accordance with GAO's best practice to regularly update cost estimates and GAO plans to use these updated estimates to measure programs' cost changes going forward. DHS revised the format of its Future Years Homeland Security Program report to include acquisition affordability tables for select major acquisition programs. However, the report shows\u2014and GAO's analysis of programs' current cost estimates confirms\u2014that some programs face acquisition funding gaps in fiscal year 2018. GAO also reviewed 4 programs that were early in the acquisition process and planned to establish department-approved schedule and cost goals in calendar year 2017. However, these programs were delayed in getting department approval for their initial acquisition program baselines (APB) for various reasons and, therefore, GAO excluded them from GAO's assessment of whether programs were on track to meet their schedule and cost goals during 2017. DHS leadership subsequently approved initial APBs for 2 particularly complex and costly programs\u2014a border wall system along the southwest U.S. border and the Coast Guard's Heavy Polar Icebreaker\u2014in January 2018. GAO plans to assess these programs in next year's review, but provide more details on all 4 additional programs in the individual assessments in appendix I. DHS's policies for managing its acquisition portfolio generally reflect key portfolio management practices, but opportunities exist to leverage the results of these policies. For example, DHS's policies require components to submit a certification of funds memorandum when a program re-baselines as a result of a cost, schedule, or performance breach. DHS leadership approved the program's revised APB and removed it from breach status, even though DHS's Chief Financial Officer identified that the program's revised LCCE was not affordable. DHS leadership subsequently approved initial APBs for 2 particularly complex and costly programs\u2014a border wall system along the southwest U.S. border and the Coast Guard's Heavy Polar Icebreaker\u2014in January 2018. GAO plans to assess these programs in next year's review, but provide more details on all 4 additional programs in the individual assessments in appendix I. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS (1) update its acquisition management policy to require components to submit a certification of funds memorandum when a major acquisition program re-baselines as a result of a breach; and (2) require components to assess the results of major acquisition programs' post-implementation reviews and identify opportunities to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio. DHS concurred with both recommendations and identified actions it planned to take to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-262": "Why GAO Did This Study NASA is responsible for ensuring that its contractors and subgrantees are protected from reprisal if they disclose to certain persons or bodies information they reasonably believe is evidence of gross mismanagement of a federal contract or grant, a gross waste of federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a federal contract or grant, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a NASA contract or grant. In 2014, the statute was amended with the only significant change to protect grantee and subgrantee employees. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the whistleblower protections. This report examines (1) the extent to which NASA has investigated contractor and grantee whistleblower reprisal complaints and developed guidance for the investigations, (2) the extent to which NASA communicated the applicable whistleblower reprisal protections externally with contractors, and (3) the extent to which NASA communicated the applicable whistleblower reprisal protections with grantees. GAO reviewed relevant documentation, including guidance, and interviewed NASA officials. GAO also reviewed a generalizable sample of contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016 to determine the extent to which NASA included a whistleblower clause. What GAO Found From 2008 to June 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) addressed whistleblower reprisal complaints within required time frames. The OIG received 277 whistleblower disclosures leading to 48 reprisal complaints from 2008 through June 2017, and handled those complaints within required time frames. The OIG updated its guidance for investigating reprisal complaints to include subgrantee employees. During the course of GAO's review, the OIG updated the investigation guidance in October 2017 to include subgrantee employees. The Administrator of the NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) failed to meet the required review time frame and issue an order of final determination of reprisal for 5 completed investigations received from the OIG from 2008 through June 2017. In all 5 cases, the Administrator took longer than the 30 days to issue an order. In one of those 5 complaints, an official from the Office of General Counsel was unable to provide GAO with the issued order and said he did not believe one was completed, and could not provide an explanation as to why an order was not completed. Despite acknowledging these challenges, the Administrator does not have a formal process or criteria to monitor and evaluate the way the office handles issuing an order of final determination of reprisal to ensure that it meets the statutory time requirements. Without monitoring, evaluating, and taking appropriate corrective action based on the way the Administrator or his or her designee makes a final determination of reprisal, there is no assurance that whistleblower reprisal complaints will be handled within required time frames in the future. NASA almost always communicates whistleblower protections to its contractors, but internal guidance is unclear. In almost all of the contracts GAO reviewed, NASA had met its obligation to ensure its contractors are communicating whistleblower protections to their employees through a whistleblower contract clause. GAO also found that NASA has put in place guidance to its contracting workforce on the protections, and guidance on when to include the whistleblower clause in contracts. However, GAO found that some NASA officials have interpreted this guidance differently. Further, NASA's guidance does not reflect an agency-wide policy on when to include the whistleblower clause when modifying a contract. Unlike provisions affecting contractors, the statute does not require NASA to ensure that grantees or subgrantees notify employees in writing of their rights under the statute. Unlike the requirement for NASA to ensure contractors communicate whistleblower reprisal rights to their employees in writing and in the employees' predominant language, the statute does not prescribe a similar requirement for NASA to ensure that grantees communicate whistleblower reprisal protections to their employees. During the grant application process, NASA requires grantees to attest that they will not require grantee employees to sign confidentiality agreements that would prohibit them from reporting fraud, waste, and abuse. NASA officials said that grant awards do not include a mechanism, such as a term or condition, to encourage NASA grantees to notify their employees of their whistleblower reprisal protections. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NASA monitor, evaluate, and make appropriate corrective actions, such as a documented process, to ensure it reviews reprisal complaints in a timely manner. NASA concurred with all three recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-692T": "Why GAO Did This Study Railroads are required to implement PTC to prevent train-to-train collisions, derailments due to excessive speed, and incursions into work zone limits. Railroads may receive a maximum 2-year extension from FRA past the December 31, 2018, deadline if they meet six criteria set forth in statute. GAO was asked to testify on the implementation of PTC. This statement addresses (1) the status of PTC implementation and FRA's efforts to ensure railroads are in compliance with PTC deadlines and (2) the extent to which FRA has taken steps to ensure railroads are in compliance with PTC deadlines. This statement is based on GAO's March 2018 report, which examined PTC implementation and FRA's efforts to ensure railroads are in compliance with PTC deadlines. GAO reviewed FRA documents and interviewed FRA officials and representatives from 40 railroads. What GAO Found As of June 30, 2018, many railroads reported that they remain in the equipment installation and field-testing stages, which are early stages of PTC implementation. However, since GAO last testified in March 2018, railroads have made progress on equipment installation. Specifically, about half of the 40 railroads reported being more than 90 percent complete with locomotive equipment installation. Similarly, nearly three-quarters of railroads that must install wayside equipment reported being more than 90 percent complete. The remaining one-quarter of railroads are among those designated by FRA as at-risk of both not meeting the end of 2018 implementation deadline and not completing the requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. Specifically, in August 2018, FRA identified 9 railroads\u2014all commuter railroads\u2014as at-risk, fewer than the 12 railroads FRA had previously designated as at risk in its June 2018 letters to railroads. In June, July, and August 2018, FRA held three PTC symposiums that were attended by representatives from all 40 railroads and that focused on the extension process and substitute criteria, PTC testing, and safety plans, respectively. FRA's June 2018 symposium covered information consistent with GAO's March 2018 recommendation that the agency adopt a method for systematically communicating information related to the requirements and process for an extension to railroads. FRA officials said that they have clarified that for railroads eligible to use substitute criteria, initiating field testing was one approach that could potentially qualify as substitute criteria, rather than initiating revenue service demonstration (RSD). Representatives from the railroads that participated in the symposiums found them to be helpful and some railroads reported that the information presented led them to adjust their approach to meeting the December 2018 deadline. In recent months, FRA has continued to provide assistance to railroads and has taken a series of steps to better prepare railroads for the 2018 deadline. More than three-quarters of railroads (32 of 40) reported to GAO that they plan to apply for an extension. However, FRA officials noted that with the exception of possibly one or two railroads, they anticipate that all railroads will likely need an extension. FRA's already substantial workload is expected to increase as railroads continue to submit documentation necessary for extensions and continue PTC implementation activities. FRA is focused on ensuring railroads are in compliance through the December 2018 deadline\u2014whether via an extension or by completing implementation. FRA officials report that they anticipate almost all railroads will likely request an extension, but only one\u2014a Class I railroad\u2014had submitted an application for an extension as of early September 2018. FRA will need to review and approve all related documentation associated with each extension request and make a determination within 90 days, meaning if a railroad were to submit its extension request on December 31, 2018, FRA would have until the end of March 2019 to approve or deny the railroad's extension request. In addition, many railroads will also be submitting to FRA: requests for substitute criteria, test requests to initiate field testing or RSD, revisions to PTC implementation plans, and PTC safety plans. FRA officials told GAO that in trying to manage their workload, they initially told railroads they did not have time to review draft submittals, but they found that taking the time to conduct draft reviews ultimately led to higher quality formal submittals and accelerated the overall review process. In addition, FRA officials said that their goal is to not delay any railroad that is ready to move into testing, and that they advised railroads to build 30\u201345 days for test request reviews into their project schedules. Despite these efforts, railroads remain concerned about the agency's ability to manage the PTC workload in the coming months and beyond 2018. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to FRA to improve its oversight of PTC implementation. FRA has taken some actions in response to GAO's March",
    "gao_GAO-18-140": "Why GAO Did This Study FDA is responsible for reviewing medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness. In 1997, FDA added a requirement that the agency use the least burdensome approach during certain parts of PMA and 510(k) reviews. FDAMA also added a provision that GAO review FDA's implementation of the least burdensome requirements. This report examines (1) the extent to which FDA requested additional information to support medical device reviews, and the factors that contributed to disagreements between sponsors and FDA, and (2) FDA's training on the least burdensome requirements and how it evaluates its training. GAO reviewed FDA guidance and training, and interviewed FDA officials and industry representatives. GAO also reviewed FDA's audit plans and interviewed FDA officials. What GAO Found The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) frequently requested additional information to support medical device reviews, and sponsor disagreements often related to the least burdensome requirements. FDA requested sponsors provide additional information for a majority of the medical device submissions it reviewed from 2001 through 2016. For example, from 2001 through 2016, FDA issued a large number of deficiency letters relative to the number of submissions, although there was variation annually. FDA officials acknowledged the historical increase in the number of deficiency letters and additional information letters, and noted the more recent decrease. The least burdensome requirements were often a significant contributing factor in disagreements between medical device sponsors, according to FDA officials and available FDA data. FDA officials said the most effective means of resolving disagreements is through discussion and mediation, and to that end, the Ombudsman's office is routinely involved in discussions between firms and medical device reviewers during the review process. FDA officials indicated that training specific to the least burdensome requirements was held in the years following the enactment of FDAMA in 1997. FDA officials said the agency offered other presentations in subsequent years that they said covered similar least burdensome topics. FDA officials said the agency is implementing such processes for all training, including courses related to the least burdensome requirements. FDA is also required by the 21st Century Cures Act to conduct an audit of the training and its effectiveness in implementing the least burdensome requirements. FDA is taking steps that may improve its requests for additional information overall, but has not fully evaluated its implementation of the least burdensome requirements. FDA is developing and implementing smart templates that guide reviewers as they evaluate medical device submissions and develop requests for additional information. FDA officials told GAO that the agency has had a smart template in place for the 510(k) process since 2013, and plans to hire a person to develop a template to guide PMA reviews, which will likely take most of 2018. FDA officials told GAO that the agency plans to hire a person to develop a template to guide PMA reviews, which will likely take most of 2018. In addition, FDA officials told GAO that the agency has not developed performance metrics that would allow it to evaluate its implementation of the least burdensome requirements. According to federal standards for internal control, performance metrics are important for management to have relevant, reliable, and timely information available for management decision-making and external reporting purposes. Without such a metric, FDA may be asking medical device sponsors to provide information unnecessarily or in less efficient ways that are not in compliance with the requirement to use the least burdensome approach to medical device reviews. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FDA develop performance metrics and use them to evaluate the implementation of the least burdensome requirements, such as during its planned audits of medical device deficiency letters. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-106": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S. agencies have provided about $5 billion in foreign assistance to Colombia in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. The U.S. government has also supported a range of counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, including eradication, interdiction, and alternative development. GAO was asked to review U.S.-Colombia counternarcotics efforts. This report examines (1) U.S. agencies' performance monitoring of counternarcotics activities in Colombia, (2) the extent to which U.S. agencies have evaluated the effectiveness of these efforts, and (3) the extent to which U.S. agencies have implemented alternative development programs in Colombia. GAO reviewed U.S. and Colombian counternarcotics efforts, analyzed U.S. and Colombian data, and interviewed U.S. and Colombian officials and experts. What GAO Found U.S. agencies have conducted ongoing performance monitoring of various counternarcotics activities in Colombia, but have not evaluated the effectiveness of these efforts. U.S. agencies have conducted a range of performance monitoring efforts, but State, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have not conducted evaluations of U.S. eradication and interdiction efforts in Colombia. Various U.S. officials acknowledged that the substantial increases in coca cultivation and cocaine production as well as other significant changes that have occurred in Colombia in recent years, including the end of aerial eradication, the conclusion of the peace agreement with the FARC, and decreases in Colombian and U.S. counternarcotics budgets, necessitate that the U.S. government review its approach to counternarcotics efforts and consider adjustments to reflect these developments. Without a comprehensive review of the U.S. counternarcotics approach in Colombia that considers the combination of eradication, interdiction, and alternative development efforts, the U.S. government lacks important information on how to most effectively combat drug trafficking in a changing environment in Colombia. To undertake such a review, the U.S. government might determine the need to collect additional information and conduct further evaluations of its counternarcotics programs, but it could also potentially use a range of existing information on what is known about the effectiveness of eradication, interdiction, and alternative development programs. U.S. agencies have provided a variety of support for Colombian interdiction efforts, including capacity building and operational support. These efforts resulted in the seizures of a substantial amount of cocaine and precursor chemicals and disrupted drug trafficking organizations by arresting these organizations' leadership and seizing valuable assets. However, the long-term effects of these efforts are unclear due to continued increases in cocaine production and the emergence of new drug traffickers. U.S.-supported alternative development programs in Colombia have attained some positive outcomes, but have faced implementation challenges. For example, USAID evaluations and monitoring data show that alternative development programs have achieved a number of positive results in increasing opportunities to participate in the legal economy in Colombia, but have also faced issues that reduced their effectiveness.

    "gao_GAO-19-176": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS is responsible for ensuring that taxpayers comply with tax laws and that the agency has the capacity to hire and train its workforce. IRS has a long-standing lack of a strategic approach to human capital management. GAO designated strategic human capital management as a high-risk area in 2001 because of the federal government's long-standing lack of a consistent strategic approach to human capital management. GAO was asked to review IRS's strategic workforce planning efforts. This report assesses (1) how IRS defines its workforce needs and develops strategies for shaping its workforce; (2) the extent to which IRS identified the critical skills and competencies it will require to meet its goals, and describe its strategy to address skills gaps in its workforce; and (3) the extent to which IRS's Human Capital Office (HCO) has the capacity to hire employees in hard to fill positions. GAO reviewed IRS's strategic workforce planning efforts, analyzed IRS data, and interviewed IRS and Treasury officials. What GAO Found IRS has scaled back strategic workforce planning activities in recent years. Prior to 2011, IRS staff within its HCO or other dedicated program office conducted and coordinated agency-wide strategic workforce planning efforts. IRS officials told GAO that resource constraints and fewer staff with strategic workforce planning skills due to attrition since 2011 required HCO to largely abandon strategic workforce planning activities. Instead, HCO generally focused its efforts on completing HR transactions, such as retirements and benefits processing, meeting legal compliance activities, and facilitating hiring of seasonal employees. Since 2011, key human capital activities\u2014such as developing an inventory of skills, identifying skills gaps, and attrition forecasting\u2014decreased and shifted to the individual business divisions and program offices. IRS officials cited management familiarity of programmatic needs, challenges, processes, and culture as a benefit of workforce planning autonomy at business divisions and program offices. However, the officials told GAO these activities were often performed only to the extent those divisions had the time, resources, and top management interest. As a result, the quality of key human capital activities was uneven across the agency, if performed at all. In addition, IRS's implementation of its workforce planning initiative has been delayed for three primary reasons, according to IRS documents and officials. IRS could improve reporting on its progress in addressing skills gaps. High attrition among IRS employees, particularly in complex enforcement occupations and lower-than-average employee satisfaction rates, puts IRS at continued risk of skills gaps. These skills gaps have already been a significant contributor to IRS's decisions to scale back important enforcement activities that are critical to promoting voluntary compliance and closing the tax gap. However, IRS has not targeted its limited resources to addressing issues among the mission critical occupations most at risk of skills gaps. Instead, activities such as skills gaps assessments are only conducted to the extent business divisions and program offices make resources available, and management is aware of and inclined to seek assistance from IRS's HCO. Reporting on the results of efforts to close skills gap and developing a work plan or other mechanism for prioritizing assessments would better position IRS to address key gaps. Additionally, the results of an interagency working group effort intended to address skill gaps among IRS revenue agents and other occupations with skills gaps across the government may hold important lessons for addressing skills gaps among mission critical occupations at IRS. Each of these issues is exacerbated by limited capacity within HCO, which has redirected its resources to implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and meeting other routine transactional human resource requirements. Measuring the extent to which each of activities is effective would help HCO target resources to the most effective activities as it seeks to improve its capacity for hiring employees in hard to fill positions in the future. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS fully implement its strategic workforce planning initiative, improve reporting on its progress in addressing skills gaps, and develop a work plan or other mechanism for prioritizing assessments. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-471": "Why GAO Did This Study The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made significant changes to the tax law affecting both individuals and corporations. IRS is responsible for processing tax returns and issuing refunds. The act also required IRS to deactivate individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITIN) and reauthorize and renew ITINs. GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This report examines (1) the extent to which IRS's customer service, processing, and other services improved during the 2018 filing season compared to prior years and (2) the challenges IRS faced during the 2018 filing season and the extent to which IRS developed a management structure to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials. GAO also interviewed IRS officials and representatives from the Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC) and other organizations. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally improved during the 2018 filing season compared to prior years. For example, IRS answered 80 percent of calls seeking live assistance and reduced wait times. IRS also developed new methods of monitoring and reporting service performance across telephone, online, and in-person channels to identify changes in taxpayer behavior and better adapt to their needs. However, IRS has not completed the actions GAO recommended to improve its correspondence performance. For example, IRS established its new online account service in November 2016 and taxpayer use of this service has increased since then. IRS also managed multiple processing challenges during the 2018 filing season, including changes in tax law and issues with hiring and redistributing work responsibilities. IRS identified more potential fraud and noncompliance through February 15, 2018, than it had by the same time last year. IRS identified a larger number of potentially fraudulent or noncompliant returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or Adjusted Tax Credit prior to issuing refunds\u2014340,000 compared to 162,000 at the same time last year. IRS also reduced the percentage of returns for which it was unable to verify wage information to 13 percent, compared to 58 percent in 2017. IRS also identified more potential fraud and noncompliance by verifying wage information than it did at the same time last year. IRS officials said that the agency has not held refunds for taxpayers not claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or Adjusted Tax Credit until it has the wage information available and has verified the wage information. IRS officials said that the agency has not held refunds because of the volume of existing cases, challenges of processing large numbers of refunds on a single day, and other costs to the agency, such as inquiries from taxpayers about their refunds.

    "gao_GAO-19-145": "Why GAO Did This Study The Corps is responsible for regulating commercial shellfish aquaculture activities, which include seeding, rearing, cultivating, transplanting, and harvesting shellfish. The Corps also oversees compliance with the Endangered Species Act, which requires the Corps to consult with other federal agencies, states, tribes, and the public if a proposed Corps action may adversely affect endangered species or their designated critical habitats. The Corps also requires entities to submit an application to the Corps for authorization to conduct such activities. GAO was asked to review the Corps' permitting process. This report describes, for 2012 through 2017, (1) the number and outcomes of the applications the Corps received for shellfish aquaculture activities and the types of permits the Corps used to authorize such activities, and (2) the experiences of permit applicants in selected districts in seeking Corps authorization for their shellfish aquaculture activities. GAO analyzed Corps data on applications, authorizations, and the types of permits the Corps used to authorize such activities from 2012 through 2017. GAO interviewed Corps officials and applicants from four Corps districts\u2014Baltimore, New Orleans, Norfolk, and Seattle\u2014and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and Corps documents. GAO also interviewed Corps officials and applicants in four districts. What GAO Found Based on GAO analysis of Corps data, GAO found that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) authorized most of the 3,751 applications it received from 2012 through 2017 using various types of general and individual permits. Of the 19 Corps districts that have coastal waters within their geographic areas of responsibility, 17 Corps districts received shellfish aquaculture applications, with the Seattle District receiving the most applications and the New England District receiving the next highest amount. The number of applications does not correspond to the level of shellfish activity in a particular district, however, as some activities may be authorized under a general permit without triggering the need for an entity to submit an application for Corps authorization. The majority of Corps districts (13 of 17) authorized shellfish aquaculture applications using the Corps' nationwide permit, which is a key mechanism for authorizing commercial shellfish aquaculture activities. The Corps added conditions to this or other general permits to account for state or regional environmental or other relevant regulatory concerns. For example, two districts GAO reviewed\u2014Norfolk and Seattle\u2014generally used Nationwide Permit 48 to authorize shellfish aquaculture activities in their districts, but added conditions to the nationwide permit to address concerns specific to their regions. The majority of Corps districts (13 of 17) also authorized shellfish activities under individual permits, but overall individual permits represented about 3 percent (85 of 3,281) of authorized activity. Through interviews with 15 permit applicants from the four districts GAO reviewed and with Corps district and headquarters officials, GAO found that applicants had mixed views on their experiences in seeking authorization for their various shellfish aquaculture activities. Overall, 10 of the 15 applicants across the four districts said they understood the application process. Several of these applicants said that their knowledge stemmed from previous experience seeking authorization from the Corps or from information provided by state or Corps officials. Similarly, 10 applicants from the four districts described the length of time the Corps took to authorize their activities as reasonable, with several applicants commenting that the Corps was efficient in reviewing and authorizing their application. For these applications, the length of time ranged from 1 day to about 4 months. In contrast, 11 permit applicants across the four districts cited facing one or more difficulties with various aspects of the application process. For example, 5 of the 15 applicants indicated they were unclear about what steps were involved in the application process such as the information they needed to submit as part of the application or how to meet the requirements outlined in the permit terms and conditions. In contrast, 11 permit applicants across the four districts cited facing one or more difficulties with various aspects of the application process. For example, 5 of the 15 applicants indicated they were unclear about what steps were involved in the application process such as the information they needed to submit as part of the application or how to meet the requirements outlined in the permit terms and conditions. Corps officials from headquarters and the four districts said it is generally their goal to authorize applications within 60 days, but limited staffing, heavy workloads, and the need to coordinate or consult with other federal, state, or tribal agencies may prevent them from doing so. Corps officials from the four districts have taken some steps to address difficulties applicants have experienced with understanding permit terms and conditions. For example, in 2017, the Seattle District developed an approach to expedite its application process for the Nationwide Permit 48 issued in March 2017. Specifically, for those applicants who had previously been authorized under Nationwide Permit 48 in 2012 and who did not anticipate changes to their activities for the 2017 permitting cycle, district officials said they could base their review on previously submitted documentation from the applicants, allowing them to more quickly",
    "gao_GAO-18-40": "Why GAO Did This Study The drug industry is a complex network of companies that conduct research, development, and marketing for new drugs. The federal government supports new drug research through tax incentives and other mechanisms. GAO was asked to review the drug industry. This report examines (1) how the financial performance and structure of the drug industry have changed over time; (2) how reported research and development spending and new drug approvals have changed; and (3) what is known about the potential effects of consolidation on drug prices and new drug development. GAO analyzed data from 2006 through 2015 on pharmaceutical and biotechnology sales revenue, profit margins, and mergers and acquisitions; reviewed literature; and interviewed agency officials, industry experts, and academics. What GAO Found According to the data GAO reviewed, the financial performance and structure of the drug industry have changed over time, with most companies reporting pharmaceutical and biotechnology sales revenue and profit margins for most companies grew from 2006 through 2015. The number of mergers and acquisitions among companies in the industry generally held steady from 2006 through 2015, but merger and acquisition deal values increased. Market concentration varied by the specific market level considered. Industry experts GAO interviewed noted that market pressures have driven structural changes in the industry. For example, some companies that traditionally manufactured brand-name drugs are expanding into the manufacturing of generic drugs. Similarly, some traditionally generic manufacturers are expanding into brand-name manufacturing to acquire product lines with more generous profit margins. In addition, some companies that traditionally manufactured biologics are expanding into the manufacturing of generic drugs. In addition, some companies that traditionally manufactured biologics are expanding into the manufacturing of generic drugs. The growth in pharmaceutical company-reported research and development spending grew slightly from 2008 through 2014, while federally funded spending decreased slightly over the period. Industry spending focused on drug development rather than earlier-stage research, whereas direct federal spending, such as through National Institutes of Health grants, funded a greater amount of basic research. Claims for the orphan drug credit, one of several federal tax incentives encouraging drug development, increased sharply from 2005 through 2014. Biologics and orphan drugs accounted for an increasing share of new drug approvals from 2005 through 2016. Studies GAO reviewed and experts interviewed suggested that potential revenues, costs, and policy incentives influenced drug company R&D investment decisions. Research GAO examined in its literature review suggests that the level of competition in a relevant market influences drug prices. Competition also matters for innovation. Certain empirical economic studies suggest that mergers among brand-name drug companies can negatively impact companies' innovation post-merger.

    "gao_GAO-18-220": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid demonstrations allow states to test new approaches to providing and financing Medicaid coverage. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees these demonstrations. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of state-led evaluations. This report examines (1) the limitations in state-led evaluations and the extent to which CMS has addressed them, and (2) the extent to which CMS has evaluated state-led evaluations. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials and contractors. GAO also reviewed CMS's evaluations of demonstrations in selected states. GAO selected these states based on the number of years the demonstrations had been in effect and cost, among other things. GAO also interviewed CMS officials and contractors. What GAO Found The limitations in state-led evaluations of Medicaid demonstrations in selected states hindered their usefulness for federal decision-making. For example, the limitations in state-led evaluations\u2014including methodological weaknesses and gaps in results\u2014have, in part, hindered CMS's use of them to inform its policy decisions. CMS has taken steps since 2014 to improve the quality of state-led evaluations, but the agency has not established written procedures to help implement some of these improvements. For example, CMS has begun requiring states to submit final evaluation reports at the end of each demonstration cycle, rather than after the expiration of the demonstration. However, CMS has not established written procedures for implementing its planned policy, for example, for ensuring that the requirement is included in the demonstrations' strategic planning documents (STC) for all demonstrations, despite unique negotiations with each state. Federal internal control standards stress that management should implement control activities through policies. However, CMS does not have written procedures for implementing its planned policy, for example, for ensuring that the requirement is included in the STCs for all demonstrations, despite unique negotiations with each state, and that those requirements are consistently enforced. As a result, some state-led evaluations could continue to produce only more limited, interim findings that leave critical questions about the effects of the demonstrations on beneficiaries and costs unanswered. Data and other challenges have significantly limited the scope and progress of CMS's large, multi-state evaluation and the agency's evaluation of Indiana's demonstration. These challenges included limitations in the quality of CMS data and delays obtaining data directly from states. These limitations caused CMS to narrow the evaluation's scope, often by reducing the number of state demonstrations evaluated or limiting what was being examined. Despite these challenges, CMS's evaluations are likely to provide new information on the effects of demonstrations in different states to inform policy decisions. CMS has not released initial reports from the multi-state evaluation, limiting the potential use of those findings by states and other federal policymakers. CMS officials said that the reports were still under agency review and acknowledged that since some of the reports were almost 2 years old, CMS's contractor was reviewing and updating the information in them. CMS officials said that the reports had provided useful information and had influenced ongoing work with states designing related demonstrations. However, despite having received some of these reports from its contractor in 2015, CMS had not released these findings as of October 2017. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS (1) establish written procedures for implementing its policy requiring states to submit final evaluation reports after the end of each demonstration cycle, regardless of renewal status; (2) issue written criteria for when CMS will allow limited evaluation of a demonstration or a portion of a demonstration, including defining conditions, such as what it means for a demonstration to be longstanding or noncomplex, as applicable; and (3) establish and implement a policy for publicly releasing findings from federal evaluations of demonstrations, including findings from rapid cycle, interim, and final reports. HHS concurred with all three recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-427": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is the world's largest and most complex entity. Its size and complexity make it difficult to effectively manage its resources and achieve its goals. GAO has designated federal reform as a high-risk area since 1990. In March 2017, the President issued an executive order for comprehensive government reorganization. The executive order directed OMB to develop a government-wide reform plan, including both legislative proposals and administrative actions based on agency reform plans, OMB-coordinated crosscutting proposals, and public input. GAO was asked to review the status of agency reform efforts. This report examines (1) key questions to assess agency reforms, (2) the process for developing reforms, and (3) the strategic management of the federal workforce. GAO analyzed relevant documents and interviewed OMB staff. GAO also reviewed prior GAO work and leading practices. What GAO Found Given the potential benefits and challenges developing and implementing agency reform efforts, Congress and the executive branch need the tools and information to help evaluate agencies' reform proposals and ensure they are effectively implemented. Congress's role in reviewing agency proposed reforms will be critical to the success of making significant changes in how the government operates. To assist Congress in its oversight role, GAO organized its prior work and leading practices into four broad categories that can help the Congress assess proposed reforms. Goals and Outcomes of Reforms: Goals and Outcomes of Reforms: Goals and Outcomes of Reforms: Establishing Goals and Outcomes: Establishing Goals and Outcomes: Designing Proposals to Achieve Specific, Identifiable Goals.

    "gao_GAO-18-527": "Why GAO Did This Study DCTAG was created in 2007 to expand access to higher education opportunities for D.C. students. DCTAG provides awards to an average of about 4,750 recipients annually over academic years 20072016. GAO was asked to review DCTAG. This report examines (1) trends in DCTAG eligibility and enrollment, (2) DCTAG's support services, and (3) the extent to which OSSE communicates DCTAG's performance information to key stakeholders. GAO analyzed program data from the American Community Survey, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed OSSE officials. What GAO Found The number of DCTAG recipients remained relatively stable over the last decade. DCTAG provided awards to an average of about 4,750 recipients annually over academic years 20072016. DCTAG's potential eligible population remained relatively stable as amounts awarded increased and recipients graduated at higher rates than selected national comparison groups. DCTAG partners with other entities to offer support services intended to help D.C. students prepare for college, apply for financial aid, and stay on track to graduate college. These partners include other entities within the Office of the Secretary of Education (OSSE), as well as partners in the broader community such as public and private high school officials and college access providers. OSSE's 2017 annual report to Congress on DCTAG did not include DCTAG's four program goals, nor did OSSE relate information about the performance of the program to those goals. Instead, the 2017 annual report was comprised of descriptive statistics that were presented without explanation or sufficient context to allow readers to understand the significance of what was being reported. Specifically, this information was unrelated\u2014quantitatively or qualitatively\u2014to DCTAG's program goals of ensuring D.C. residents are aware of and apply to DCTAG, or of helping DCTAG students make smarter college choices, which OSSE officials told us includes helping students select schools where they are more likely to graduate. As a result, it is unclear how to interpret the information presented in these reports and whether reported results indicate positive or negative program performance. Federal standards for internal control state that program managers should communicate necessary quality information so both internal and external parties can help the program achieve its objectives. GAO has previously reported that annual reports are essential for managers of federal programs to communicate to decision makers the progress an agency has made toward achieving its goals during a given year and, in cases where goals are not met, identify opportunities for improvement or whether goals need to be adjusted. In addition, GAO reported that performance measurement does not require establishing a causal link between program activities and program outcomes, but rather emphasizes that the nature of performance measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting of program accomplishments, particularly toward pre-established goals. Unless DCTAG's stakeholders have access to an annual report that relates performance information to the program's goals, they may be limited in their ability to judge the significance of what is being reported, determine whether the agency is making progress toward achieving its goals, or make informed program management and funding decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OSSE issue an annual report on DCTAG that relates information about the program's performance to the program's goals. OSSE concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-242": "Why GAO Did This Study The FMS program is a key component of U.S. national security and foreign policy. The FMS program is managed by the Department of Defense (DOD) and is intended to help foreign governments purchase defense equipment. DOD is authorized to waive nonrecurring costs on sales of major defense equipment. GAO was asked to review the FMS program. This report addresses (1) nonrecurring cost waivers approved by DOD from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, (2) factors DOD considers when reviewing waivers, and (3) efficiency of the waiver review process. GAO analyzed data from DOD on waivers approved from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, reviewed relevant DOD policy, and interviewed DOD and military department officials. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD approved nonrecurring cost waivers valued at nearly $16 billion that it might otherwise have collected from foreign governments as part of its major defense equipment sales. Over this period, DSCA approved 810 of the 813 waiver requests it received, resulting in an approval rate of more than 99 percent. However, the dollar value of the approved waivers does not, in all instances, reflect the total amount that will ultimately be waived once sales are finalized. Rather, it reflects a ceiling for the nonrecurring costs that DOD could waive. During this time frame, DSCA collected $106 million in nonrecurring costs; however, this amount may be associated with FMS cases prior to fiscal year 2012. GAO was not able to determine the exact amount actually waived once sales agreements were finalized due to data limitations. DOD considers a variety of factors when reviewing waivers, but ultimately, the department wants to ensure that sales are not jeopardized. Individually and collectively, these sales complement various foreign policy, national security, and economic objectives. DOD's waiver review process is, at times, inefficient, includes repetitive steps, and does not account for the value of the waiver request. For 23 of the 24 waiver requests GAO reviewed, on average, the military departments determined whether to endorse requested waivers around 270 days after they were submitted by the foreign government. DSCA then, on average, took less than 60 days to decide whether to approve the waiver, which is consistent with its policy to respond to waiver requests within 60 days of receipt. There is no policy regarding the time frame for military departments to review a waiver request, as military officials stated the review time can vary depending on whether additional information must be obtained from the foreign government. However, recognizing an opportunity to streamline the review process, DSCA has worked with the Air Force to identify one office that did not add value, reducing the Air Force review process from three offices to two. Officials stated this action decreased the amount of time required for review. DSCA officials stated that they have improved their review times by using digital signatures when concurring on waiver decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD continue to identify opportunities to streamline the review process for nonrecurring cost waiver requests. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-105": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) investigated CSPF in the 1970s. DOL filed suit against the former trustees of CSPF and, in 1982, the parties entered into a consent decree with the plan. The consent decree provides measures intended to ensure that the plan complies with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), including providing for oversight by the court and DOL, and prescribing roles for multiple parties in its administration. GAO was asked to review CSPF's financial condition. This report examines (1) factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition and (2) DOL's oversight of CSPF. GAO reviewed CSPF's regulatory filings, analyzed DOL's oversight activities, and interviewed DOL, CSPF, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) has been underfunded since the consent decree was established in 1982. CSPF's estimated funding need was less than 40 percent prior to the consent decree going into effect. Over the next two decades, the plan generally made progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding but was never more than 75 percent funded, and funding has generally deteriorated since its 2002 filing. Overall, the plan's unfunded liability increased by approximately $11.2 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars) between January 1983 and January 2016. As a consequence, participant benefits were never fully secured by plan assets over this period, as measured by ERISA's minimum funding standards. Stakeholders identified several factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition and reflect the challenges faced by many multiemployer plans. For example, many multiemployer plans have experienced financial difficulties due to a combination of investment losses and insufficient employer contributions. In addition to being underfunded prior to the consent decree going into effect, stakeholders identified other specific factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, such as trends within the national trucking industry and its workforce, funding challenges and common investment practices of multiemployer plans, and the impact of market downturns on long-term investment performance. Stakeholders also described the effects of the 2007 withdrawal of a key employer, United Parcel Service (UPS), on CSPF's critical financial condition. DOL has provided oversight in its role as described in the consent decree. Generally, it reiterates the requirement that CSPF must comply with ERISA, and gives DOL the authority to provide input on certain actions proposed by the plan. Additionally, the consent decree requires CSPF to employ a named fiduciary to administer and manage the plan's investment assets, set investment policy, and select and supervise investment managers to create separation of plan trustees and staff from the management of plan investments. The plan must seek court approval for certain actions, such as the appointment of new trustees and named fiduciaries, and DOL can raise objections to these proposed actions. The named fiduciary must also seek court approval for proposed changes to the investment policy. DOL has completed at least two investigations of the plan since the consent decree was established; neither of which resulted in adverse findings or action against CSPF. DOL has completed at least two investigations of the plan since the consent decree was established; neither of which resulted in adverse findings or action against CSPF. DOL officials stated that to meet its ERISA enforcement priorities, the agency's national and regional offices of DOL develop enforcement projects to focus enforcement activities on specific plan activities. Investigations based on enforcement projects or triggered by participant complaints are conducted by regional offices. DOL officials stated that the Chicago Regional Office is primarily responsible for oversight of CSPF at the regional level. DOL concluded, based on available information, that CSPF had implemented monitoring procedures and DOL would take no further action.

    "gao_GAO-18-361": "Why GAO Did This Study The NDAA 2017 made changes to TRICARE, including terminating the TRICARE Standard and Extra options, establishing a new option called TRICARE Select, and ensuring that 85 percent of TRICARE Select beneficiaries are covered by the network of civilian providers. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the NDAA 2017 changes. This report examines (1) the extent to which nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers have access to TRICARE, (2) the extent to which nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers have reported that they have access to TRICARE, and (3) the extent to which DOD's surveys of nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers indicate that specific geographic locations may have access problems. GAO analyzed DOD's surveys of nonenrolled beneficiaries and civilian providers in fiscal years 2008 through 2011, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found Nonenrolled beneficiaries reported experiencing fewer problems accessing TRICARE, and more reported obtaining care when desired. Nationwide, a lower percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries reported that they experienced problems finding any type of provider in the 2012-2015 survey (29 percent) when compared to the prior 2008-2011 survey (31 percent). Specifically, fewer nonenrolled beneficiaries reported that they experienced problems finding a primary care provider than in the prior survey (22 percent in 2012-2015 compared to 25 percent in 2008-2011). However, there was no significant statistical difference over time in the percentage of beneficiaries who reported experiencing problems finding a specialty care or mental health care provider. Compared to the prior survey, a higher percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries reported that they were able to obtain appointments as soon as they desired. Specifically, the percentage of nonenrolled beneficiaries who made non-urgent appointments for health care and reported that they were able to usually or always obtain an appointment as soon as they thought they needed increased from 87 percent in the 2008-2011 survey to 90 percent in the 2012-2015 survey. However, the most commonly reported length of time they waited between making an appointment and actually seeing a provider did not change from the 2008-2011 surveys. Nonenrolled beneficiaries' positive ratings of TRICARE have generally increased over time and vary compared to other federal health plans. Specifically, nonenrolled beneficiaries' positive experience ratings for their primary care, specialty care, and health plan rating were lower than those of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and higher than those of Medicaid beneficiaries, which is similar to what GAO found for the previous survey. Civilian providers' reported awareness of TRICARE has generally increased over time, while mental health providers' acceptance of new TRICARE patients has decreased. Nationwide, a higher percentage of civilian providers reported that they were aware of TRICARE in the 2012-2015 civilian provider survey (84 percent) than those from the 2008-2011 civilian provider survey (82 percent). Specifically, since the previous survey, GAO found that awareness increased for specialty care providers (from 92 to 94 percent) and mental health care providers (from 68 to 74 percent). In addition, when GAO analyzed these results by location type, GAO found that civilian providers in both the TRICARE Standard and Extra networks reported higher awareness of TRICARE than nonnetwork providers, regardless of provider type. Among individual provider types, the biggest difference in acceptance between network and nonnetwork providers was for mental health care providers with 79 percent of network mental health care providers reporting acceptance of new TRICARE patients compared with 30 percent of nonnetwork mental health care providers. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD concurred with GAO's overall findings.",
    "gao_GAO-18-103": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid HCBS\u2014which provides services to individuals with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities or to chronic conditions\u2014provides services to help individuals remain in their homes or live in a community setting. States can provide HCBS under one or more types of programs authorized under different sections of the Social Security Act, including several state plan and waiver authorities. GAO was asked to review Medicaid HCBS. This report examines (1) how selected states conduct needs assessments for HCBS, (2) the extent to which selected states have made efforts to make their HCBS needs assessment processes more uniform, and (3) the extent to which CMS has taken steps to improve HCBS needs assessments. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from six states selected to represent a range of HCBS programs and delivery systems. GAO also interviewed CMS officials and state and beneficiary advocates. What GAO Found The six selected states GAO reviewed used multiple tools and entities to conduct needs assessments across their distinct Medicaid home- and community-based services (HCBS) programs, for which both functional eligibility criteria and amount of services available to beneficiaries can differ widely. The selected states varied in the extent to which their needs assessment tools were either tailored to a single Medicaid HCBS program or used across multiple, though not necessarily all, HCBS programs in the state. The selected states also varied in the extent to which the same or different needs assessment tools were used for different purposes, such as determining functional eligibility and developing a service plan. The selected states also varied in whether they used formulas based on information collected using Medicaid HCBS needs assessment tools to inform key functional eligibility and service planning decisions. States may use such formulas as a means of meeting goals of consistent treatment of individuals based on needs. The six selected states reported taking steps to unify needs assessment processes across Medicaid HCBS programs as a means of meeting goals such as improving the efficiency and effectiveness of assessments. For example, four states\u2014Connecticut, New York, Minnesota, and Washington\u2014had adopted or were piloting needs assessment tools that were used across multiple state Medicaid HCBS programs (though not necessarily all such programs in the state) rather than completing separate needs assessments for each separate program. In addition, Kentucky and North Carolina had recently implemented new tools for specific Medicaid HCBS programs that would be considered for use in additional HCBS programs in the future. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken steps to make HCBS needs assessment processes more uniform, but some concerns remain unaddressed. CMS has implemented two key programs that facilitate state efforts to make their HCBS needs assessment processes more uniform, among other goals. One of these is called Testing Experience and Functional Tools (TEFT) and is designed, in part, to test the effectiveness of a set of specific questions that states can use to conduct needs assessments. The TEFT assessment questions are limited to needs that may be relevant among these populations and do not assess needs that may apply to only certain populations; for example, questions to assess cognitive status that may apply to those with intellectual or developmental disabilities or other conditions but that do not apply to those with physical disabilities only. CMS has taken steps to address conflicts of interest that may occur when HCBS providers conduct needs assessments, but gaps remain. For example, HCBS providers may conduct certain needs assessments that inform HCBS functional eligibility determinations, but specific conflict of interest requirements are generally not in place for such assessments. In addition, HCBS providers may conduct certain needs assessments that inform HCBS functional eligibility determinations, but specific conflict of interest requirements are generally not in place for such assessments. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS ensure that all types of Medicaid HCBS programs have requirements for states to avoid or mitigate potential conflicts of interest on the part of entities that conduct needs assessments. HHS concurred with this recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-224": "Why GAO Did This Study The UN has deployed 71 peacekeeping operations since 1948. The UN's mandates include maintaining ceasefires, protecting civilians, and providing electoral assistance. The United States plays a significant role in both the management of peacekeeping operations and encouraging reforms to improve peacekeeping activities. GAO was asked to review the UN's peacekeeping operations. This report examines (1) the UN's process to establish and renew peacekeeping operations, including the tasks these operations perform; (2) the Department of State's assessment of the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations; (3) how the United States works within the UN to adjust peacekeeping mandates and associated resources; and (4) UN member states' concerns regarding the UN's performance information. GAO analyzed UN peacekeeping operations' mandates, State's assessments, and UN budgets; interviewed U.S., UN, and host government officials; and conducted fieldwork at four UN peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Kosovo, and Lebanon. What GAO Found The United Nations (UN) establishes and renews peacekeeping operations, which perform a variety of tasks. The mandates of peacekeeping operations established prior to 1998 tend to include the monitoring of cease-fire as a mandated task, while those established after 1998 also include tasks such as the protection of civilians, facilitation of humanitarian assistance, and enforcement of economic sanctions or an arms embargo. Comparatively, operations in the African region have mandates that include the highest number of tasks. The United Nations Security Council (Senate) establishes and renews peacekeeping operations, which conduct a range of tasks working with UN member states. The UN Security Council defines mandates, or tasks, for each operation, and the peacekeeping operations perform a variety of activities to fulfill these tasks. In some cases, these activities are specifically mandated by a Security Council resolution; in others, the peacekeeping operation engages in an activity pursuant to a broad grant of authority to achieve a task. Each UN peacekeeping operation performs a unique set of tasks. The mandates of peacekeeping operations established prior to 1998 tend to include the monitoring of cease-fire as a mandated task, while those established after 1998 also include tasks such as the protection of civilians, facilitation of humanitarian assistance, and enforcement of economic sanctions or an arms embargo. The UN Security Council has defined 16 categories into which these activities can be classified, including supervision or monitoring of ceasefire agreements, the protection and promotion of human rights, and protecting civilians. State's assessments of the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations show that UN peacekeeping operations generally do not fully meet the U.S.-stated principles of effective peacekeeping and face challenges to achieving their mandates. For example, State's assessment of the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations against the U.S. government's stated principles of effective peacekeeping found that the UN peacekeeping operations generally do not fully meet the U.S.-stated principles of effective peacekeeping and face challenges to achieving their mandates. For example, State's assessment of the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations against the U.S. government's stated principles of effective peacekeeping found that the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) mandate includes the provision of elections assistance in support of the nation's political process, but, according to State officials, the lack of host government cooperation has relegated MONUSCO's efforts in this area to technical assistance. State officials also noted that the UN Security Council does not always adopt U.S. proposals to change mandates to align with these principles, such as including an exit strategy. State officials acknowledged that State must continue to work with the Security Council to ensure that peacekeeping operations meet the principles of effectiveness, such as modifying mandates to include exit strategies. In doing so, the UN and its member states could have greater assurance that they have set up peacekeeping operations for success. The United States has worked with the UN to adjust peacekeeping mandates, but does not have sufficient information to determine if UN resource decisions accurately reflect these adjustments. For example, USUN officials told GAO that they do not have sufficient information to allow them to determine accurate resource allocation to peacekeeping operations when the Security Council makes a change to the mandate. For example, USUN officials told GAO that as a result of the Security Council's decision to reduce resources for specific tasks in MONUSCO's 2017 mandate--such as Security Sector Reform and Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration activities, where little progress had been achieved--the United States had sought to reduce the MONUSCO budget to reflect this change. However, the USUN did not have complete information from the UN on all of the costs associated with this change,",
    "gao_GAO-19-53": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to develop a plan to transfer the administration of the MTFs from the military departments to the DHA. The act also required GAO to review DOD's plan. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD addressed the statutory elements for the transfer of the administration of the MTFs to the DHA and (2) the extent to which DOD has demonstrated that its plan will reduce or better manage duplication and improve efficiency. GAO reviewed DOD's plan and supporting documents, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) addressed each of the four statutory elements in its June 2018 plan to transfer the administration of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) from the military departments to the DHA. DOD dedicated most of the plan to describing the governance structure of DOD's new administrative framework and to describing the schedule for the phased transfer of the administration of the MTFs to the DHA by October 1, 2021. DOD's plan provided less detail on addressing efforts to eliminate duplicative activities; maximizing efficiency; and reducing the number of headquarters-level military, civilian, and contractor personnel. Specifically, DOD's plan does not provide details about how it will achieve the 10-percent reduction (approximately 695 positions from the current baseline) while the DHA experiences personnel growth during each phase. The plan includes a figure depicting military and civilian full-time equivalent positions for the current baseline of the DHA and the military departments' respective medical department headquarters and intermediate commands. Contractors are also mentioned in the plan at a high level, but without specific data. Additionally, DOD continues to take steps to evaluate personnel requirements. Specifically, according to two June 2018 Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness memorandums, DOD is conducting a review and validation of headquarters-level personnel requirements, which GAO discusses in more depth later in this report. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD define and analyze the 16 functions currently excluded from the transfer to the DHA, validate headquarters-level personnel requirements, and conduct a comprehensive review to determine the least costly mix of personnel. DOD concurred with all three recommendations and noted the actions it was taking to address each recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-148": "Why GAO Did This Study VA manages about 1.4 million buildings with about 5-million gross square feet, including 471 buildings with about 5-million gross square feet. VA is responsible for disposing of these buildings, including demolitions of medical facilities and enhanced-use lease agreements. The VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to review VA's disposal efforts. This report examines (1) the challenges VA faces disposing of its vacant property and how it is addressing those challenges and (2) the extent to which VA is tracking and monitoring the disposal of its properties. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and other documents related to VA's real property management, and interviewed VA officials and stakeholders. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 31 properties selected based on their characteristics, including associated disposal costs, historic status, age, and size. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) faces challenges in disposing of its vacant properties, including the management of its real property disposals. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with cited the time it takes to complete environmental and historic reviews as key challenges for disposals. For example, it took about 2 years to conduct an environmental review of temporary storage facilities in Biloxi, as no environmental issues were identified. In another case, it took about 2 years to conduct an environmental review of VA's Cincinnati-Fort Thomas property, as asbestos and lead paint were identified during the course of the review. For those disposals requiring historic reviews, it took about 5 years on average, depending on the complexity of the disposal. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with stated that due to lack of staff expertise and resources, VISNs' and local facilities' managers may choose to contract out these reviews, but procuring contractors may also add time to the disposal process, as facility managers need to define the terms of work and identify contractors. Further, environmental and historic reviews can affect VA's decision-making process with regard to choosing a disposal method, potentially lengthening the time it takes for disposal. For example, it took about 5 years to conduct a historic review of the St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks property due to the need to collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including the neighboring Army National Guard base, the state's historic preservation office, local community council, community organizations, and many veteran service organizations; and addressing the adverse effects on historic properties, according to VA officials. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with also identified property characteristics that affect the marketability of VA properties\u2014historic status, deficient physical conditions, location, unusable building configuration, and repair costs\u2014as barriers for disposal. VA officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with also stated that it is unclear what specific steps need to be taken for disposals, what are the targeted time frames for completing those steps, and who is responsible for completing them. Federal internal controls call for documentation to help management oversee execution of procedures by establishing and communicating the \"who, what, when, where, and why\" to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigates the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel and a means to communicate that knowledge as needed to external parties, such as external auditors or interested third parties. Federal internal controls also call for management to define objectives in specific terms\u2014in this case, disposal actions\u2014so they are understood at all levels of the entity. VA has taken steps in the last 6 years to improve its real property inventory and the data it collects on its vacant properties, including properties VA has identified for disposal. These steps include: (1) requiring VA's Veterans Integrated Service Networks' and local facilities' managers to verify and certify the accuracy of the information in the Capital Asset Inventory (CAI), including which buildings are identified for disposal, whether a disposal plan is in place, when the disposal is to occur, what type of disposal method is to be used, and what are the costs associated with the disposal. (2) requiring facility managers to make ongoing updates to the CAI database, including when actively planning disposal projects and individual projects are complete. (3) generating \"discrepancy reports\" to identify problems with inaccurate or outdated property data in the CAI. VA officials in headquarters told GAO that they use the information gathered as part of the Secretary's initiative to begin the re-use or disposal process for 430 buildings, including a spreadsheet to track and monitor the disposal status of these buildings. However, VA does not collect all the information necessary for its headquarters officials to track and monitor the disposal of VA's vacant properties. For example, VA does not have the ability in its CAI to collect detailed data on the status of disposal projects\u2014specifically, data fields for facility managers to input detailed information on the status of: (1) disposal actions, (2) due diligence reviews",
    "gao_GAO-18-192": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a long-standing interest in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the President announced that the United States would rebalance to the Pacific to help sustain U.S. military presence and posture abroad. GAO was asked to review DOD's rebalance to the Pacific. This report examines the extent to which DOD has developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that include desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO reviewed DOD's strategy documents from 2012 to 2015 and analyzed the six selected strategy documents. GAO also interviewed DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff, and the U.S. Pacific Command. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that include most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO has previously reported that effective national strategies incorporate six characteristics, and their associated desired elements. GAO found these six DOD strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included, to varying degrees, 24 of the 31 desired elements GAO determined as being the most relevant to an effective strategy for the rebalance. For example, as a set, the six strategy documents contained a detailed description of the operating environment in which activities for the rebalance were to take place and included references that described the relationship of the rebalance to the Pacific to other strategies, goals, and objectives. Collectively, the strategy documents referred to selected types of resources needed, such as the deployment of ships and aviation assets, and who would be implementing the strategies. GAO was, however, unable to find any reference to 7 of the 31 desired elements in any of the six strategy documents. For example, 2 of the 7 missing elements were: lack of a documented, consistent definition of the rebalance to the Pacific. Based on GAO's systematic review, GAO found that none of DOD's six strategy documents issued from 2012 to 2015 included a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific that described the rebalance's key terms, major functions, mission areas or activities. Further, DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff, and the U.S. Pacific Command involved in planning and implementing the rebalance to the Pacific were unable to identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents, and consequently could not provide a definition that was in use consistently across the department. During discussions about the absence of a definition, these PACOM officials told GAO that all PACOM activities were rebalance activities, even activities that were underway before the President's announcement to rebalance. Senior DOD policy officials referred GAO to the speeches of senior administration officials given since the President's 2011 address to derive the definition of the rebalance.

    "gao_GAO-18-347": "Why GAO Did This Study The ticketing industry is a complex and growing industry that includes ticketing for concerts, sporting events, and theater. The industry is not federally regulated, but the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can enforce the act for issues related to ticketing and ticketing companies. GAO was asked to review ticketing issues. This report examines (1) how ticketing practices, fees, and resale prices vary by industry and event; (2) consumer protection concerns about ticket fees, speculative and fraudulent tickets, and designated resale exchanges; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have addressed ticket resale restrictions and disclosure requirements. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from federal agencies, industry stakeholders, and consumer advocacy groups. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 23 events selected based on price, number of tickets sold, and number of seats held. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found The concert, sports, and theater industries vary in how they price and distribute tickets. Many tickets are resold on the secondary market, typically at a higher price. Ticket resale prices can be significantly higher than primary market prices and brokers account for most sales on major ticket exchanges. When tickets on the primary market are priced below market value\u2014that is, priced less than what consumers are willing to pay\u2014it creates greater opportunities for profit on the secondary market. Ticket fees vary in amount and type among the primary and secondary markets, and among different ticketing companies and events. For example, primary and secondary market ticketing companies charged total fees averaging 27 percent and 31 percent, respectively, of the ticket's price. Ticket fees vary in amount and type among the primary and secondary markets, and among different ticketing companies and events. For example, the largest ticketing company\u2014believed to have the majority of the U.S. market share\u2014frequently did not display its fees prominently or early in the purchase process. For 14 of 23 events GAO reviewed, fees could be learned only by selecting a seat; clicking through one or two additional screens; creating a user name and password (or logging in); and clicking an icon labeled \u201cOrder Details,\u201d which displayed the face-value price and the fees. Other consumer protection concerns that have been raised involve the amount charged for ticketing fees, speculative and fraudulent tickets, and designated resale exchanges. Policymakers, consumer organizations, and industry participants have proposed or implemented a number of ticket resale restrictions and disclosure requirements, each of which have or would have advantages and disadvantages for consumers or industry participants. For example, some states have caps on the price at which tickets can be resold, while others have repealed caps and some studies have questioned their enforceability. However, some industry participants are exploring technology and other market-based approaches to address concerns related to secondary market activity. For example, some industry participants are implementing technological and market-based approaches to address concerns related to secondary market activity.

    "gao_GAO-18-645T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government and the nation's critical infrastructure are dependent on IT systems and electronic data, which make them highly vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation's security, prosperity, and well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Specifically, the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the protection of cyber critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect individual's privacy and sensitive data. Until these recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges GAO identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. What GAO Found Safeguarding federal information systems and the systems that support critical infrastructures has been a long-standing concern of GAO. Due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of information security vulnerabilities, GAO has designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In 2003, GAO expanded the information security high-risk area to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure. At that time, GAO highlighted the need to manage critical infrastructure protection activities that enhance the security of the cyber and physical public and private infrastructures that are essential to national security, national economic security, and/or national public health and safety. GAO further expanded the information security high-risk area in 2015 to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII). Since then, advances in technology have enhanced the ability of government and private sector entities to collect and process extensive amounts of PII, which has posed challenges to ensuring the privacy of such information. In addition, high-profile PII breaches at commercial entities, such as Equifax, heightened concerns that personal privacy is not being adequately protected. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, GAO has identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take. These actions include developing a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, securing federal systems and information, protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and protecting privacy and sensitive data. Until these recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges GAO identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. What GAO Recommends GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing the four cybersecurity challenges. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because many of these recommendations have not been implemented. Of the roughly 3,000 recommendations made since 2010, nearly 1,000 had not been implemented as of July 2018. GAO has also designated 35 as priority recommendations, and as of July 2018, 31 had not been implemented.",
    "gao_GAO-17-805T": "Why GAO Did This Study Lifeline provides telephone and broadband service to low-income Americans. Lifeline subscribers pay a subsidy to help them pay for telephone service, and the program is administered by FCC. In May 2017, GAO reported that Lifeline's structure and structure were ineffective in ensuring the availability of telephone service for low-income Americans. GAO recommended that FCC evaluate Lifeline's effectiveness in meeting program goals. This testimony discusses (1) FCC's evaluation of Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals, (2) FCC's financial controls for Lifeline, and (3) FCC's oversight of Lifeline providers. This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 report, Lifeline: Financial Controls Needed to Address Controls and Integrity Risks, GAO-17-177, and May 2017 report, Lifeline: Financial Controls Needed to Address Controls and Integrity Risks, GAO-17-177. What GAO Found The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals but has taken recent steps toward evaluation. In the past, FCC has called for program evaluations to review the administration of universal service generally, including Lifeline, but has not completed such evaluations. In March 2015, GAO found that FCC had not evaluated Lifeline's effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the Universal Service Fund (USF). GAO recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. GAO recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. FCC and USAC have established financial controls for Lifeline, including obtaining and reviewing information about billing, collecting, and disbursing funds. They have also developed plans to establish other controls, such as establishing a national eligibility verifier (National Verifier) for Lifeline providers to determine the eligibility of applicants seeking Lifeline service. However, as discussed in GAO's May 2017 report, GAO found that weaknesses remain, including the lack of requirements to effectively control program expenditures above approved levels, concerns about the transparency of fees on customers' telephone bills, and a lack of FCC guidance that could result in Lifeline and other providers paying inconsistent USF contributions. GAO recommended that FCC (1) review and approve, as appropriate, spending above the budget in a timely manner; (2) require a review of customer bills as part of the contribution audit to include an assessment of whether the charges, including USF fees, meet FCC Truth-in-billing rules with regard to labeling so customer bills are transparent and appropriately labeled and described, to help consumers detect and prevent unauthorized changes; and (3) respond to USAC requests for guidance and address pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements to ensure the contribution factor is based on complete information and that USF pass-through charges are equitable. FCC generally agreed with those recommendations. In addition, GAO found that USAC's banking practices for the USF result in oversight and accountability risks that FCC has plans to mitigate. Specifically, FCC maintains USF funds\u2014whose net assets as of September 2016 exceeded $9 billion\u2014outside of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to Office of Management and Budget advice provided in April 2000. However, subsequent to this advice, in February 2005 GAO reported that FCC should reconsider this determination in light of the status of universal service monies as federal funds. FCC has decided to move the funds to the Treasury. FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds to the Treasury, such as better tools for fiscal management of the funds, but FCC has not finalized and implemented its plan and moved the funds to the Treasury. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the National Non-Lifeline Access Database (NLAD) database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline-supported services. However, GAO found that their ability to do so is hindered by a lack of access to, or awareness of, state eligibility databases that can be used to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment. These challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. GAO also found that Lifeline may be vulnerable to ineligible subscribers obtaining service and the testing found examples of Lifeline providers being nonresponsive, or providing inaccurate information. FCC and USAC have implemented some mechanisms to enhance oversight of Lifeline providers, but",
    "gao_GAO-17-784T": "Why GAO Did This Study The LIHTC program provides tax credits to developers of qualified rental housing projects that reserve all or a portion of their units for low-income tenants. Allocating agencies are responsible for awarding the tax credits to owners of qualified rental housing projects that reserve all or a portion of their units for low-income tenants. GAO was asked to review the LIHTC program. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which allocating agencies implemented key LIHTC requirements and (2) the extent to which IRS oversees the program. This statement is based on GAO's 2016 report, LIHTC: Allocating Agencies Implemented Different Practices for Key Requirements, GAO-16-148, and 2015 report, LIHTC: IRS Oversight of Allocating Agencies Has Been Minimal. GAO reviewed IRS regulations and guidance, analyzed 58 allocation plans and 9 site visits, and interviewed IRS officials. What GAO Found Allocating agencies implemented requirements for qualified allocation plans (QAP) in varying ways and had processes in place to meet requirements for awarding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Allocating agencies also had procedures to assess costs, but determined award amounts for projects differently, used various cost limits and benchmarks to determine reasonableness of costs, and used widely varying criteria for basis boosts. Agencies also had processes in place to monitor compliance. However, some of these practices raised concerns. For example, IRS conducted few reviews of allocating agencies and had not reviewed how agencies determined basis boosts. Data on noncompliance were not reliable and IRS used little of the reported program information. IRS had not directly participated in an interagency initiative to augment its databases with LIHTC property inspection data. Both GAO's 2015 and 2016 reports concluded that opportunities existed to enhance oversight of the LIHTC program, specifically by leveraging the knowledge and experience of HUD. HUD is the lead federal agency for providing affordable rental housing. HUD's role in the LIHTC program is generally limited to the collection of information on tenant characteristics. However, it has voluntarily collected project-level information on the program since 1996 because of the importance of LIHTC as a source of funding for affordable rental housing. HUD's LIHTC databases, the largest federal source of information on the LIHTC program, aggregate project-level data that allocating agencies voluntarily submit and information on tenant characteristics that HUD must collect. Since 2014, HUD also has published annual reports analyzing data it must collect on tenants residing in LIHTC properties. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement. In its 2016 report, GAO recommended that IRS address weaknesses identified in data entry and programming controls to ensure reliable data are collected on credit allocations. IRS agreed with the recommendation and has explored possibilities to improve the database.",
    "gao_GAO-18-341": "Why GAO Did This Study Since September 2012, CMS has begun using prior authorization to ensure that Medicare coverage and payment rules have been met before the agency pays for selected items and services. GAO was asked to review the use of prior authorization. This report examines (1) the extent to which Medicare expenditures have changed since September 2012, (2) the extent to which providers and suppliers have reported benefits to prior authorization, and (3) the extent to which CMS monitors prior authorization and evaluates the results. GAO analyzed data from CMS and other sources, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed CMS and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has begun using prior authorization to ensure that Medicare coverage and payment rules have been met before the agency pays for selected items and services. During this time, expenditures for items and services subject to prior authorization have been reduced. GAO estimates potential savings may be as high as about $1.1 to $1.9 billion, although other CMS program integrity efforts may have contributed to these reductions. Many stakeholders, including providers, suppliers, and MAC officials, support prior authorization, citing benefits such as reduced unnecessary utilization. However, providers and suppliers report concerns about whether accessories deemed essential to group 3 power wheelchairs are subject to prior authorization and can be provisionally affirmed under the permanent durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) program. By not including essential accessories in prior authorization, CMS may hinder its ability to achieve one of the stated benefits of the prior authorization program\u2014to allow providers and suppliers to know prior to providing the items whether Medicare will likely pay for them. All four prior authorization demonstrations are either paused or will end in 2018, and CMS does not have plans to extend these programs or expand the use of prior authorization to additional items and services with high rates of unnecessary utilization or improper payments. By not taking steps, based on results from the evaluations, to continue prior authorization, CMS risks missed opportunities for achieving its stated goals of reducing costs and realizing program savings by reducing unnecessary utilization and improper payments. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS take steps to continue prior authorization, based on results from the evaluations, to continue prior authorization. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations but said it would continue to evaluate prior authorization programs and take GAO's findings and recommendations into consideration in developing plans or determining appropriate next steps.",
    "gao_GAO-17-809T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy has experienced four significant mishaps at sea since January 2017, including two collisions and one grounding. The Navy has also increased the number of ships deployed overseas, which has resulted in a 17 percent reduction from the 333 ships it had in 1998. GAO has previously reported that the Navy has been reporting persistently low readiness levels. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which the Navy has assigned ships homeported overseas, (2) the factors used to determine the size and composition of ship crews, (3) the extent to which the Navy has completed ship maintenance on time, and (4) the extent to which the Navy has implemented readiness rebuilding. This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 report, which examined the Navy's readiness rebuilding efforts. GAO reviewed the Navy's readiness rebuilding efforts and interviewed Navy officials. What GAO Found Since 2006, the Navy has assigned more of its surface combatants and amphibious ships to overseas homeports. In 2006, 20 ships were homeported overseas (7 percent of the fleet); today, 40 ships are homeported overseas (14 percent of the fleet) in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and Italy; and an additional destroyer will be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan in 2018. The primary reason that Navy ships homeported overseas provide more deployed time than ships homeported in the United States is that the Navy reduces their training and maintenance periods in order to maximize their operational availability. In addition, the operational schedules the Navy uses for overseas-homeported ships limit dedicated training and maintenance periods, resulting in difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. In May 2015, GAO found that the Navy's guidance does not require that the factors it uses to calculate manpower requirements be reassessed periodically or when conditions change, to ensure that these factors remain valid and that crews are appropriately sized. GAO made several recommendations to address this issue, including that the Navy reassess the standard workweek, require examination of in-port workload, develop criteria to reassess the factors used in its manpower requirements process, and update its ship manpower requirements. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations, stating that it is committed to ensuring that the Navy's manpower requirements are current and analytically based and will meet the needs of the existing and future surface fleet. As of August 2017, DOD had not yet taken any actions to implement these recommendations. GAO believes that, until the Navy makes the needed changes, its ships may not have the right number and skill mix of sailors to maintain readiness and prevent overworking its sailors. The Navy has implemented a revised operational schedule in November 2014, which it referred to as the optimized fleet response plan. However, in May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty in implementing its new schedule as intended. Both the public and private shipyards were having difficulty completing maintenance on time, owing primarily to the poor condition of the ships after more than a decade of heavy use, deferred maintenance, and the Navy's inability to accurately predict how much maintenance they would need. GAO reported that in 2011 through 2014 only 28 percent of scheduled maintenance for surface combatants was completed on time and just 11 percent was completed on time for aircraft carriers. GAO updated these data as of August 2017 to include maintenance availabilities completed through the end of fiscal year 2016 and found continued difficulty completing maintenance on time for key portions of the Navy fleet. In September 2016, GAO found that although the Department of Defense (DOD) has stated that readiness rebuilding is a priority, implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound planning, and the lack of these elements puts the overall rebuilding efforts at risk. The Navy has since extended its time frame for readiness recovery to at least 2021, but it still has not developed specific benchmarks or interim goals for tracking and reporting on readiness recovery. Navy officials cited several challenges to rebuilding readiness, chief among them the continued high demand for its forces, the unpredictability of funding, and the current difficulty with beginning and completing ship maintenance on time. In January 2017, the President directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a readiness review and identify actions that can be implemented in fiscal year 2017 to improve readiness. However, high demand for naval presence will continue to put pressure on a fleet that is already stretched thin across the globe. Looking to the future, the Navy has plans to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent, but it has not yet shown the ability to adequately man, maintain, and operate the current fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement GAO's recommendations\u2014particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the",
    "gao_GAO-17-796T": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. government has a long-standing interest in enhancing the security of inbound international mail. In fiscal year 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that the volume of inbound international mail was about 1.3 billion pieces, and the volume of inbound international mail was about 1.3 billion pieces. DHS has also identified a variety of threats to U.S. security, including the use of illegal or inadmissible drugs, fentanyl, and synthetic opioids. DHS has also identified a variety of other threats to U.S. security, including the use of fentanyl and synthetic opioids. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which DHS has seized inbound international items that may pose a threat to U.S. safety and security, (2) the extent to which DHS has used EAD to target mail for inspection, and (3) the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection. This statement is based on GAO's report, CBP: Seized International Items Seize a Variety of Threats to U.S. Safety and Security ( GAO-08-32, May 16, 2017). What GAO Found DHS has seized a variety of inbound international items that may pose a threat to U.S. safety and security. Of those, DHS seized about 70 percent from mail and 30 percent from express cargo. Seized items are categorized in SEACATS as either drugs or merchandise. Among the approximately 308,000 seizures, illegal or inadmissible drugs accounted for about 47 percent of total seizures and merchandise accounted for about 53 percent. USPS and CBP have not established performance targets for their pilot programs to target mail for inspection. According to USPS officials, the goal of these pilots is to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted by CBP based on electronic advance data (EAD). However, USPS and CBP have not established performance goals for these pilots. As a result, CBP and USPS risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots' success or failure. As such, GAO recommended that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, (1) establish measureable performance goals for pilot programs and (2) assess the performance of the pilots in achieving these goals. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with this recommendation and plans to implement it by February 28, 2018. USPS and CBP have not evaluated the costs and benefits of increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing the volume of inspected mail and increasing the percentage of inspections that result in identification of a threatening or illegal item. This potential outcome could decrease time and resources needed for the screening process\u2014potentially decreasing costs\u2014and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. Specifically, regarding the costs of collecting EAD, USPS has not calculated the current costs of collecting EAD from countries with which it has data-sharing agreements, but officials stated that USPS does not incur significant additional costs for each new designated postal operator or type of mail for which it begins collecting EAD. While some of the costs of obtaining EAD may be borne by designated postal operators in other countries, rather than directly by USPS, costs to USPS to use EAD to target mail for inspection may include: equipment and personnel required to identify targeted mail (such as equipment required to sort through hundreds of pieces of mail to identify a single piece of mail), and software upgrades required to exchange data with foreign postal operators and with CBP. In light of this situation, any expenditure of financial resources to make any additional infrastructure and information technology upgrades necessary to implement the use of EAD for targeting merit careful consideration. Beyond costs, GAO found that USPS and CBP have not performed an analysis of the benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection, including the effectiveness of targeted inspection based on EAD relative to other methods of selecting mail for inspection. Thus, the extent to which targeting based on EAD might result in an increased ability to identify threats or other benefits over current methods is unknown. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this testimony.",
    "gao_GAO-18-374T": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons program, which includes the production of plutonium isotopes and the development of nuclear weapons. NNSA's budget estimates for its modernization programs total about $54.4 billion and the President's out-year funding projections total about $55.5 billion. GAO has previously reported that NNSA's estimates of funding needed for its modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections included in the President's planned near- and long-term modernization budgets. GAO was asked to testify on its recent work on NNSA's modernization programs. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which NNSA's modernization plans and estimated budgetary resources support the modernization plans, (2) the extent to which DOE spends billions of dollars on environmental cleanup, and (3) the extent to which DOE has taken steps to improve management of contracts, projects, and programs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report on NNSA's 25-year plans to modernize the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and its supporting infrastructure, and GAO's April 2017 report on DOE's environmental liabilities. GAO reviewed NNSA's fiscal year 2017 budget materials and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found GAO found that NNSA's estimates of funding needed for its modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections included in the President's planned near- and long-term modernization budgets. In the near-term (fiscal years 2018 through 2021), GAO found that NNSA may have to defer certain modernization work beyond that time period to execute its program within the planned budget, which could increase modernization costs and schedule risks. This is a pattern GAO has previously identified as a \u201cbow wave\u201d\u2014an increase in future years' estimated budget needs that occurs when agencies are undertaking more programs than their resources can support. In the long-term (fiscal years 2022 through 2026), GAO found that NNSA's modernization program budget estimates sometimes exceeded the projected budgetary resources planned for inclusion in the President's budget, raising additional questions about whether NNSA will be able to afford the scope of its modernization program. Second, the costs of some major modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon refurbishments\u2014may also increase and further strain future modernization budgets. GAO is currently reviewing NNSA's Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. GAO's April 2017 report identified misalignment between NNSA's estimate of its budget needs and NNSA's internal cost range estimates for several of its major modernization programs. GAO found that NNSA's budget estimates were generally consistent with NNSA's high- and low-range cost estimates. However, for some years, NNSA's low-range cost estimates exceeded the budget estimates for some of the programs, suggesting the potential for a funding shortfall for those programs in those years. GAO recommended in its April 2017 report that the NNSA Administrator include an assessment of the affordability of NNSA's portfolio of modernization programs in future versions of the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, such as by presenting options (e.g., potentially deferring the start of or canceling specific modernization programs) that NNSA could consider taking to bring its estimates of modernization funding needs into alignment with potential future budgets. In commenting on GAO's April 2017 report, NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation. DOE also faces challenges with addressing its environmental liabilities and its cleanup mission. In February 2017, GAO added the federal government's environmental liabilities to its High-Risk List. Specifically, GAO found that the federal government's environmental liability has been growing for the past 20 years\u2014and is likely to continue to increase\u2014and that DOE is responsible for over 80 percent ($372 billion) of the nearly $450 billion reported environmental liability. Notably, this estimate does not reflect all of the future cleanup responsibilities that DOE may face. In addition, DOE has not consistently taken a risk-informed approach to decision-making for environmental cleanup, and DOE may therefore be missing opportunities to reduce costs while also reducing environmental risks more quickly. GAO's recent work in this area has also identified opportunities where DOE may be able to save tens of billions of dollars. The Secretary of Energy has taken several important steps that demonstrate DOE's commitment to improving management of contracts and projects. However, GAO's recent work indicates that, even with these efforts, NNSA and EM continue to face long-standing challenges in several areas. For example, GAO found that DOE's recent efforts do not address several areas where it",
    "gao_GAO-18-258": "Why GAO Did This Study Discipline is a key tool for promoting academic achievement and preventing school-related violence. GAO was asked to review discipline issues. This report examines (1) the patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, (2) the challenges selected school districts reported with student behavior and how they are approaching discipline, and (3) the actions the Department of Education and the Department of Justice have taken to identify and address any disparities or discrimination in school discipline. GAO analyzed federal discipline data by student demographics and school characteristics; visited five school districts to provide illustrative examples of approaches to discipline; and interviewed federal agency officials and selected school district officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found GAO found that Black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined in K-12 public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data. This pattern of disproportionate discipline persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school these students attended. GAO used a regression model to examine the independent effect of school poverty on discipline. GAO also interviewed officials from five school districts in five states about how they are addressing discipline, including challenges they face in responding to student behavior. Several school officials said that complex issues, including the effects of poverty, mental health issues, and family dysfunction, contributed to behavior that leads to discipline. Officials in all five selected school districts GAO visited said they are implementing efforts to better address student behavior or reduce the use of exclusionary discipline. For example, officials in all five selected school districts said they are implementing alternative discipline models that emphasize preventing challenging student behavior and focus on supporting individuals and the school community, such as positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS), restorative justice practices, and social emotional learning (SEL).

    "gao_GAO-19-27": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Guard counterdrug program is a DOD-wide program that provides support to state law enforcement agencies in addressing illicit drug production, trade, and consumption. The National Guard Bureau is responsible for coordinating the National Guard's counterdrug program. GAO was asked to review the National Guard counterdrug program. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has a current strategy and guidance for the National Guard counterdrug program, (2) the extent to which DOD has provided funding to state counterdrug programs, and (3) the extent to which DOD's process for approving and distributing funds to state counterdrug programs incorporates DOD's strategic counternarcotics priorities. GAO reviewed DOD's 2011 counternarcotics and global threats strategy, National Guard Bureau guidance, and state plans; interviewed DOD officials; and analyzed data from the National Guard Bureau and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) lacks a current strategy and guidance for the National Guard counterdrug program. DOD's 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats Strategy, the governing strategy for the National Guard counterdrug program, is outdated and does not reflect current drug threats outlined in more recent executive branch strategies. While the 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats Strategy shares common themes with the updated executive branch strategies, it has not been updated to reflect changes in the drug threats faced by the United States that are outlined by the more recent executive branch strategies. Without a DOD counternarcotics and global threats strategic framework that reflects DOD's current strategic priorities and drug threats, the National Guard counterdrug program risks focusing activities and resources in areas that are less imperative to address than others and that do not counter current drug threats. The National Guard Bureau had guidance\u2014National Guard Regulation 500-2\u2014that prescribed policies, procedures, and responsibilities for the National Guard counterdrug program, but it was rescinded in September 2014 by Chief National Guard Bureau Instruction 3100.01 to conform with new National Guard publications guidance, according to National Guard Bureau officials. National Guard Bureau officials stated that they intended to publish a Chief National Guard Bureau Manual in September 2014, concurrent with Chief National Guard Bureau Instruction 3100.01, which would have provided additional operating guidance for administering and operating the counterdrug program. However, National Guard Bureau officials acknowledged that they have not issued a manual that provides detailed procedures and processes to implement National Guard counterdrug program policies since the prior operating guidance in the National Guard regulation was rescinded in September 2014. Without interim guidance that provides detailed procedures and processes for the National Guard counterdrug program, states will continue to be left without clear instructions on how to operate and administer the program, such as how and when to provide support across state lines and to interagency partners. The National Guard Bureau has taken steps to improve the availability of funds when operating under a continuing resolution. National Guard officials stated that they have experienced program disruptions during these periods. The National Guard Bureau has revised its process for funding the National Guard counterdrug program in fiscal year 2017 to try to mitigate the effects of DOD's process for providing funds under continuing resolutions on the program. However, National Guard Bureau officials have assessed the risks and believe this is the best solution available for funding the program during a continuing resolution until the enactment of the final appropriation. DOD has established a process for development and review of the state plans\u2014an annual plan of each state's counterdrug activities\u2014to ensure that state counterdrug program activities reflect DOD's counternarcotics strategic priorities. However, since at least 2009, DOD has not met the statutory requirement to examine the adequacy of state plans prior to distributing funding to state counterdrug programs. GAO found that the delay in approval of states' plans for their counterdrug activities has worsened since 2009, and in fiscal year 2018, approval took over 9 months (283 days) after funding was provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government note that management should monitor activities and evaluate the results of programmatic changes. Assessing the revised process for reviewing states' plans would enable DOD to determine what additional actions are needed to ensure the plans are approved by the Secretary of Defense before funding is provided to state counterdrug programs, as statutorily required. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD issue a counternarcotics and global threats strategic framework that incorporates relevant national-level strategies and reflects current drug threats, and update it, as appropriate, upon",
    "gao_GAO-19-100": "Why GAO Did This Study The HHF program is a federally funded, nonfederal program that provides assistance to help homeowners facing foreclosure in the states hardest hit by the housing crisis. HFAs are required to spend all of their HHF funds by December 31, 2021. GAO was asked to review Treasury's monitoring of HHF. This report (1) determines the extent to which Treasury's monitoring addresses leading practices for program oversight, (2) provides information on HFAs' active programs and the status of HFAs' progress toward program targets, and (3) describes challenges in implementing HHF programs that HFAs and others identified. GAO analyzed Treasury's monitoring policies and procedures, as implemented by 2016, against leading practices for an effective monitoring framework. GAO also interviewed Treasury staff and HFAs and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) monitoring of the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) addresses or partially addresses leading practices for program oversight. Treasury's policies and procedures to monitor HFAs' implementation of the HHF program address 10 leading practices, including practices related to the collection of periodic performance reports and validation of performance through site visits. However, Treasury's assessment of HFAs' internal control programs, development of performance indicators, documentation of goals and measures, and documentation of HFAs' monitoring could better address leading practices. For example, Treasury does not systematically collect or evaluate HFAs' risk assessments. HFAs' participation agreements require them to submit an annual certification of their internal control programs by an independent auditor to Treasury. However, Treasury does not routinely collect or evaluate HFAs' risk assessments. Further, in those instances when Treasury does collect them, it does not analyze the assessments to evaluate whether the risk levels are appropriate. Treasury also does not require HFAs to consistently document which of their staff are responsible for internal control execution. Without requiring HFAs to consistently update their documentation, particularly as HFAs are winding down their HHF programs and staff begin to turn over, Treasury cannot be assured that HFAs are keeping their staff updated about who is responsible for monitoring issues and internal control execution. Treasury and HFAs created quantitative output and outcome measures to assess HFAs' performance. However, some of Treasury's performance measures are not clearly stated, and Treasury did not create consistent methodologies for HFAs to use to assess the performance of their HHF programs. Because some of Treasury's performance measures are not clearly stated and because Treasury did not design consistent methodologies for HFAs to use in setting targets, as HFAs close down their HHF programs, Treasury has a limited ability to compare performance across HFAs or aggregate these data to evaluate how well the HHF program as a whole is achieving its goals. Treasury collects quarterly data on outcomes from HFAs that implement four of the six HHF program types: mortgage payment assistance, principal reduction, reinstatement programs, and transition assistance programs. However, Treasury did not design outcome measures in a way that would permit it to use these data to evaluate whether HFAs or the overall program are achieving the stated goals. For example, Treasury did not design outcome measures in a way that would permit it to use these data to evaluate whether HFAs or the overall program are achieving the stated goals. Further, Treasury did not design outcome measures in a way that would permit it to use these data to evaluate whether HFAs or the overall program are achieving the stated goals. As many programs are closing, further clarification or changes would not capture the full scope of the program and would not improve such evaluations. Treasury, HFAs, and mortgage servicers identified challenges related to implementing HHF programs. For example, staff from four HFAs that are implementing HHF programs, mortgage servicers and housing counseling agencies that are involved with HHF, and other interested organizations, including those that work with HFAs, described challenges related to staffing and multiple funding rounds, program implementation, outreach to borrowers, program accessibility, the variety of programs and their status, and external factors. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Treasury annually collect and evaluate HFAs' risk assessments, which include HFAs' risk levels, and ensure that the documentation listing the HFA staff responsible for internal control execution is updated routinely. Treasury agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-317T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Commercial Crew Program is a multiphased effort that began in 2010. The Commercial Crew Program is a multiphased effort that began in 2010. The program is a multibillion dollar effort that includes the development of crew transportation systems for the U.S. commercial sector. The Commercial Crew Program is a multiphased effort that began in 2010. In September 2014, NASA awarded firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX, valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase. The contracts are fixed-price, in which the government agrees to pay the contractor's reasonable costs regardless of whether work is completed. This is in contrast to a cost-reimbursement contract, in which the government agrees to pay the contractor's reasonable costs regardless of whether work is completed. Thus, under the fixed-price contracts, the contractors must generally bear the risk of cost overruns or schedule delays. This statement addresses (1) the progress of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors and (2) the risks that the Commercial Crew Program faces in developing crew transportation systems. This statement is based on GAO's February 2017 report, which examined the Commercial Crew Program's progress and risks. GAO reviewed NASA and contractor documents and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Commercial Crew Program has made progress developing crew transportation systems, but both have aggressive development schedules that are increasingly under pressure. Both Boeing and SpaceX had determined that they would not be able to meet their original 2017 certification dates, and both expected certification to be delayed until 2018. GAO found that the schedule pressures were amplified by NASA's need to provide a viable crew transportation option to the International Space Station before its current contract with Russia's space agency runs out in 2019. If NASA needs to purchase additional seats from Russia, the contracting process typically takes 3 years. Without a viable contingency option for ensuring uninterrupted access to the ISS in the event of further Commercial Crew delays, GAO found that NASA was at risk of not being able to maximize the return on its multibillion dollar investment in the space station. The Commercial Crew Program's contractors have continued to make progress finalizing their designs and building hardware as they work toward final certification of their crew transportation systems, since GAO last reported in February 2017. Each contractor's system includes a spacecraft and a launch vehicle with supporting ground systems. The contractors plan to use the test articles to demonstrate system performance and the flight spacecraft to demonstrate their ability to meet contract requirements. The contractors have notified NASA that final certification dates have slipped to the first quarter of calendar year 2019 and, through GAO's ongoing work, GAO has identified three key risk areas that could further delay certification of each contractor's crew transportation system. These areas are (1) the contractors' aggressive schedules, (2) programmatic and safety risks, and (3) the Commercial Crew Program's workload. These are consistent with the challenges GAO found facing the contractors and program in its February 2017 report.",
    "gao_GAO-19-13": "Why GAO Did This Study VBA relies on contractors to conduct disability compensation exams for veterans who have service-connected disabilities. VBA contracts with contractors to conduct these exams. VBA also requires that contractors complete required training before conducting any exams. GAO was asked to review VBA's oversight of contractors. This report examines (1) what is known about the timeliness of VBA's disability compensation exams and VBA's performance measures, and (2) VBA's oversight of contractors' qualifications and training. GAO analyzed VBA data on contractor timeliness and interviewed VBA officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and VA guidance on the use of contracted examiners. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reported that almost all contractors missed the quality target of 92 percent in the first half of calendar year 2017, and more recent data are not yet available for most districts. For example, VBA-determined quarterly quality scores\u2014the percentage of disability compensation exam reports with no errors as measured against VBA criteria\u2014for the seven contracts used by VBA in calendar year 2017 showed that contractors were frequently well below the quality target. GAO's analysis of VBA data showed that 53 percent of exams were completed within 20 days for districts 1-5, and 56 percent were completed within 30 days for districts 6-7. However, some exams took at least twice as long to complete. For example, 12 percent of exams in districts 1-5 took more than 40 days to complete. Delayed quality reviews and performance reports, and data limitations hinder VBA's monitoring of contractors. VBA's contract exam program office has identified some contractor performance problems, such as delays in completing specific exams, through its oversight of contractor performance. For example, VBA identified two contractors who were not prepared to perform all of their assigned exams because they did not have enough examiners, particularly in rural locations, which led to delays and a backlog of exam requests. VBA officials acknowledged that they could not calculate the number of completed exams that were once marked as insufficient or how long they had remained in that status due to the data limitations of the exam management system the agency used until spring 2018. The contracts require that contractors correct insufficient exams within a certain number of days and bill VBA for these exams at half price. However, VBA's lack of complete and reliable information on insufficient exams hinders its ability to ensure that either of these requirements is met. VBA officials said they were unable to fully assess individual contractor timeliness against VBA's performance targets because the exam management system did not include the date the initial exam report was submitted to VBA, which is needed to calculate timeliness as outlined in the contracts. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve key objectives. In addition, management should formulate plans to achieve those objectives. Federal internal control standards state that management should establish and operate monitoring activities and evaluate the results of those activities. In the absence of a plan for how it will capture and use data in its new exam management system to assess performance, VBA risks overpaying contractors for insufficient exams and continuing to inaccurately measure contractor timeliness. VBA relies on contractors to verify that their examiners complete required training, and agency and contractor officials told GAO that VBA does not review contractors' self-reported training reports for accuracy or request supporting documentation, such as training certificates, from contractors. VBA officials said they plan to enhance monitoring through spot checks of training records and a new training system. However, VBA has not provided details or documentation on these planned checks, such as how it will determine which records to review or the steps it will take to verify the accuracy of training records. Without such a plan, VBA risks using contractors who are unaware of the agency's process for conducting exams and reporting the results, which could lead to delays for veterans as a result of poor-quality exams that need to be redone and insufficient exam reports that need to be corrected. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VBA (1) develop and implement a plan for how it will use data from its new exam management system to oversee contractors, including how it will capture accurate data on the status of exams and use it to assess contractor timeliness, (2) monitor time spent correcting inadequate and insufficient exams, and (3) verify proper exam invoicing. VA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.",

For example, storage can help grid operators address supply disruptions, relieve transmission congestion during periods of high demand, defer the need for transmission or distribution system upgrades, and provide backup power during a power outage. GAO was asked to review the deployment of energy storage. This report examines (1) how energy storage can be used to enhance the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of grid operations, and (2) factors that affect the deployment of energy storage. GAO reviewed studies and documents and interviewed stakeholders, including stakeholders from the electric utility industry, industry associations, and stakeholders, such as state regulators and utilities. GAO also interviewed stakeholders from the Department of Energy (DOE), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). What GAO Found Energy storage can be used in various ways to enhance the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of grid operations, according to studies GAO reviewed and stakeholders GAO interviewed. Energy storage can be deployed throughout the electricity system and act as a generation, transmission, distribution, or customer-sited asset to provide various services, address operational challenges and needs, and potentially reduce costs. For example, storage can help grid operators address supply disruptions, relieve transmission congestion during periods of high demand, defer the need for transmission or distribution system upgrades, and provide backup power during a power outage. Various factors affect the deployment of energy storage for grid operations, including industry and technology readiness, safety concerns and stringency of siting requirements, increasing use of renewable resources, the cost-competitiveness of storage, and challenges with quantifying the value of storage. For example, the cost of storage systems\u2014including all the system components, installation, and integration costs\u2014is still high when compared to more traditional resources available to electric utilities, according to studies and stakeholders GAO interviewed. On the other hand, the adoption of storage for certain purposes, such as supporting increased use of renewable resources or providing backup power, includes potential benefits such as reducing greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions, or enhancing the resilience of the grid. Federal and state policymakers have used a variety of policies and other efforts to encourage the deployment of energy storage and address market barriers. For example, DOE has undertaken various efforts in response to several challenges to the deployment of storage, but funding to continue these efforts is uncertain. In addition, FERC has taken steps to address market barriers to storage deployment in wholesale markets but the final impact of these steps depends on implementation by regional transmission organizations (RTO). Moreover, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service are considering changes that could clarify the eligibility of energy storage for a tax credit. Lastly, state policies and other efforts aim to encourage the deployment of energy storage or to address market barriers; these include establishing mandates and targets for storage adoption, revising interconnection rules and planning requirements, and offering financial incentives and funding. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. FERC generally agreed with GAO's findings.",

The TRIO project has focused on migrating the financial management systems of Coast Guard, DNDO, and TSA to a modernized solution provided by IBC. GAO was asked to review the TRIO project. This report examines the extent to which (1) DHS followed best practices in analyzing the alternatives used in choosing the preferred alternative for modernizing TRIO components' financial management systems and (2) DHS managed the risks of using IBC consistent with risk management best practices. GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed DHS, IBC, and IMB officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not always follow best practices for analyzing the alternatives used in choosing the preferred alternative for modernizing the financial management systems of the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)\u2014the TRIO components\u2014to a modernized solution provided by IBC. For example, Coast Guard's and TSA's alternatives analysis (AA) supporting their selection of migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) for modernizing their financial management systems did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. In addition, GAO found that DHS guidance did not fully or substantially incorporate five of GAO's identified best practices for conducting an AOA process. The TRIO components' AAs included descriptions of the key factors, such as scores for each alternative against the selection criteria used to assess it. Based on these AAs, DHS and the TRIO components selected the federal SSP alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as their federal SSP. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process, they are at increased risk regarding their decision on the solution that represents the best alternative for meeting their mission needs. DHS and the TRIO components used key factors, metrics, and processes to analyze alternatives and related results. For example, each of the TRIO components assessed them for viability using various factors\u2014such as measures of effectiveness, cost, risk, and value\u2014and identified the three top-rated alternatives for further evaluation. DHS and the TRIO components selected the federal SSP alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as their federal SSP. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process, they are at increased risk regarding their decision on the solution that represents the best alternative for meeting their mission needs. DHS and the TRIO components generally followed three and partially met four best practices for managing the risks of using IBC for the TRIO project. For example, DHS's risk management processes generally reflected three of seven specific risk management best practices and partially reflected the remaining four practices. For example, DHS's risk management program defined rating scales to provide consistent criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity levels and defining thresholds for each risk category to determine whether risk is acceptable or unacceptable and to trigger management action. However, DHS's risk management processes did not identify all significant risks or reflect its efforts to revisit risks that had previously been closed. DHS and the TRIO components did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans including specific risk-handling action items, determination of the costs and benefits of implementing the risk mitigation plan for each risk, and developing contingency plans for selected critical risks in the event that their impacts are realized. DHS has taken various actions to manage the risks of using IBC for the TRIO project, including some that were consistent with best practices, but the TRIO project has experienced challenges raising concerns regarding the extent to which its objectives will be achieved. In connection with these challenges, the TRIO components notified DHS during April 2016 through January 2017 that certain baseline cost and schedule objectives had not been, or were projected to not be, achieved as planned. According to these notifications and DHS officials GAO interviewed, several key factors and challenges significantly impacted DHS's and IBC's ability to achieve TRIO project objectives as intended. In addition, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials identified similar issues impacting the TRIO project. In connection with these challenges, DHS and IBC began contingency planning efforts in January 2017 to identify and assess viable options for improving program performance and addressing key TRIO project priorities. Plans for DHS's path forward on the TRIO project,",
    "gao_GAO-18-94": "Why GAO Did This Study In recent years, the number of private school choice programs has grown. In school year 2016-17, more than 50,000 students participated in private school choice programs. GAO was asked to review accountability mechanisms in private school choice programs. This report examines (1) the academic, administrative, and financial accountability mechanisms in private school choice programs; (2) the information available to the public and prospective families on private school choice programs and participating private schools; and (3) how families of students with disabilities are informed about any changes in their rights under federal law when enrolling in private school choice programs, and how the U.S. Department of Education provides information to families about these rights. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed information from all 27 private school choice programs in operation as of January 2017; and interviewed officials from Education, national school choice and disability organizations, and private school choice programs. What GAO Found Most private school choice programs have academic accountability mechanisms, which can include requirements for participating private schools to administer tests, report testing results, obtain accreditation, and teach core subjects. Most programs require participating schools to administer their state's standardized test and six require schools to administer some type of norm-referenced test. Most programs have some administrative accountability mechanisms, such as requirements that participating schools employ teachers, paraprofessionals, and/or specialists who have minimum qualifications, conduct background checks on employees, comply with state and local health and safety standards, and comply with site visits by program officials. Most private school choice programs provide a directory of participating private schools for the public and prospective families, although the information included\u2014and the way it is provided\u2014varies. For example, 21 of 27 programs provide contact information, and 20 programs provide information on grades served. Far fewer programs provide information on school accreditation status (6 programs), student race and ethnicity data (5 programs), and graduation rates (4 programs). Parents GAO interviewed had mixed responses about the information provided by private school choice programs and reported using other sources of information as well. Some parents mentioned using private choice program websites as key sources of information to identify and narrow their school choice options, while other parents said they wished that the programs would provide more information to help them consider potential schools. Parents GAO interviewed had mixed responses about the information provided by private school choice programs and reported using other sources of information as well. Private school choice programs are not consistently providing information on changes in rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when a parent moves a child from public to private school, and some programs are providing incorrect information. Specifically, in GAO's review of information provided by all 27 private school choice programs in operation as of January 2017, GAO found that 9 of the 27 programs did not provide any information about these changes in rights. Moreover, among the 15 programs specifically for students with disabilities, GAO found that 4 programs provided no information about changes in rights under IDEA when a child with a disability moves from public to private school. Education officials reiterated that IDEA does not require states to provide notification about changes in rights when a parent moves a child from public to private school, but the agency has recommended that states and districts notify parents of these changes. Specifically, in 2001, Education issued a document\u2014which Education refers to as a policy letter\u2014stating that \u201cin order to avoid parental misunderstanding, the Department strongly recommends that the state and local educational agency notify parents who choose private school placement under [a private school choice program] that the students may retain certain rights under Section 504 and Title II of the ADA, although the student will not be entitled to a free appropriate public education under IDEA, while enrolled in the private school.\u201d In addition, while Education has issued guidance documents explaining the obligations of states and school districts under IDEA to ensure the equitable participation of parentally placed private school children with disabilities, Education has not developed guidance or other documents that could serve as specific notification to parents of changes in IDEA rights when a parent moves a child from public to private school. Absent a requirement in IDEA that states notify parents of such changes, states are unlikely to begin providing parents with consistent and accurate information about changes that affect some of our nation's most vulnerable children. What GAO Recommends Congress should consider requiring that states notify parents of changes in students' federal special education rights when a student with a disability is moved from public to private school by their parent. Education generally agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-25": "Why GAO Did This Study The Disposal of Controlled Substances Act requires that all persons or entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances be registered with DEA. DEA regulates these entities to limit diversion and prevent abuse. DEA also requires that all controlled substances collected in the disposal bins be destroyed in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. GAO was asked to review the use of disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. This report examines (1) the extent to which eligible entities have voluntarily chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, (2) factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, and (3) the extent to which DEA communicates with stakeholders about the disposal bins. GAO analyzed DEA data on the number of eligible entities and their locations, reviewed DEA regulations, and interviewed officials from 11 stakeholders, including DEA officials, who represent authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. What GAO Found About 3 percent of eligible entities\u2014retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy, narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, distributors, and drug manufacturers that are already authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to handle controlled substances\u2014have voluntarily chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. As of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) of eligible entities\u2014which are already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances\u2014had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most of the authorized collectors\u2014about 81 percent\u2014were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in most states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to become authorized collectors. In 44 states, less than 5 percent of the eligible entities had registered. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in most states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to become authorized collectors. GAO was able to estimate that as of April 2017, about half of the country's population lived less than 5 miles away from a pharmacy or other DEA-authorized entity offering a prescription disposal bin. According to officials from the 11 stakeholder organizations GAO interviewed, several factors may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. These factors include the associated costs of participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. For example, stakeholders said that the costs associated with purchasing, installing, and managing the disposal bins are a factor that explains the relatively low rate of participation. Stakeholders also said that uncertainty regarding how to comply with aspects of DEA's regulations for prescription drug disposal bins affected their decisions to participate. For example, officials from both of the reverse distributor stakeholders GAO interviewed cited DEA's non-retrievable standard for destruction of the inner liners of the disposal bins. DEA officials told GAO that they are uncertain about whether certain disposal methods meet this standard, and they said that the agency has not provided further guidance on how reverse distributors can meet this requirement. DEA officials told GAO that they are aware of other options for the public and entities such as long-term care facilities that are not registered as authorized collectors to dispose of controlled substances. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-144": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Defense (DOD) has a long-standing interest in ensuring that the nation's nuclear weapons are safe, secure, reliable, and controlled. In 2014, the Secretary of Defense directed DOD to address the recommendations from two separate reviews of the defense nuclear enterprise. The 2015 NC3 report recommended that DOD address the recommendations and the military services take actions to improve the defense nuclear enterprise. GAO was asked to review DOD's progress in implementing the recommendations. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's implementation of the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and (2) the changes DOD and the military services have made to their personnel reliability assurance programs. GAO reviewed DOD's processes for implementing the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3 report, and interviewed DOD and military service officials. What GAO Found DOD and the military services have made progress in implementing recommendations to improve the defense nuclear enterprise but could improve their efforts by identifying additional performance measures, milestones, and associated risks. The Defense Chief Information Officer (CIO) is working with the military services and other DOD components to track and evaluate the implementation actions taken in response to the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews; however, risks associated with these actions are not consistently identified and documented. For example, the centralized tracking tool currently contains 389 unique metrics and 370 unique milestones to aid in the assessment of the implementation actions. Additional milestones, particularly for actions more than 18 months out, and additional metrics to aid in measuring the effectiveness of actions taken, are still being identified. DOD CIO uses an internal spreadsheet to track the implementation of the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews, but it has not identified performance measures, milestones, or associated risks to evaluate these actions. DOD CIO officials stated that they are working with the offices of primary responsibility to expand on the current content of the internal tracking spreadsheet. However, there is currently no centralized collection of metrics, milestones, and other information with the same level of detail that CAPE developed and is using for the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews' recommendations. Identifying and sharing performance measures, milestones, and risks could aid DOD CIO in tracking and evaluating DOD's progress in addressing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. DOD and the military services have implemented changes to their personnel reliability assurance programs in response to 17 recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. DOD has identified nine essential elements of reliability and released updated guidance to refocus personnel reliability on these elements. Additionally, the Air Force has incorporated these nine essential elements into its Arming and Use of Force program, allowing the Air Force to use this program to ensure that its security forces meet nuclear surety requirements. The Air Force has also created a new office within the Air Force Personnel Center, the Personnel Reliability Program Administrative Qualification Cell, to assist with the administrative review process for personnel newly assigned to Personnel Reliability Program positions or returning to Personnel Reliability Program positions after working elsewhere. In response to both the personnel recommendations and the inspections-related recommendations of the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews, the Joint Staff, the Navy, and the Air Force have made changes to the procedures they use to conduct nuclear personnel reliability inspections at nuclear facilities. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD develop additional guidance for identifying and documenting risks associated with implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and identifying and communicating performance measures, milestones, and risks for the 2015 NC3 report recommendations. DOD concurred with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-178": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing U.S.-bound flights from foreign countries. TSA assesses the effectiveness of security measures at foreign airports using select aviation security standards and recommended practices adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). GAO was asked to review TSA's foreign airport assessment and air carrier inspection programs. This report (1) describes steps TSA has taken to enhance foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections since 2011, (2) describes the results of TSA's foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections, and (3) examines steps TSA takes to address any deficiencies identified during foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections. GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials and representatives from the aviation industry. GAO also conducted site visits to three of TSA's six regional operations centers (ROC) in the United States and Europe. What GAO Found Since 2011, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has taken steps to strengthen its foreign airport assessment and air carrier inspection programs. TSA has taken actions to better target program resources based on risk. For example, TSA established the Northern Virginia ROC in 2012 to oversee North Africa and the Middle East given the high risk associated with many airports in the region. TSA also conducted more targeted foreign airport assessments, such as developing the Pre-Visit Questionnaire, which host foreign airport officials fill out prior to TSA's visit. TSA also implemented more targeted airport assessments, known as targeted risk assessments, in locations where risk is high or there are other factors that require a more focused evaluation of the site's security posture. TSA also implemented cross-directorate reviews, which bring together experts across the OGS components, such as inspectors and regional directors, to identify critical vulnerabilities at foreign airports and outline an initial plan to mitigate those vulnerabilities. TSA has taken steps to resolve foreign airport access issues. For example, TSA has created the Honolulu ROC, which allowed the agency to reduce costs and travel time to airports in these locations. TSA also developed the Global Risk Analysis and Decision Support System, which strengthened its data analysis capabilities. TSA's foreign airport assessment data showed variations in compliance by region and across ICAO standards, while air carrier inspection data showed that most inspections were fully compliant. TSA officials stated that it is difficult to draw conclusions about the cumulative results because the primary concern is not whether security deficiencies are identified, but whether foreign countries are capable and willing to address security deficiencies. TSA addresses security deficiencies through various capacity development efforts, but enhanced data management could strengthen analysis and decision making. TSA provides capacity development assistance to foreign airports through on-the-spot counseling, training, technical assistance and consultation, and provision of security equipment. TSA also offers capacity development support to air carriers through on-the-spot counseling and consultation with international industry representatives. TSA could enhance data management by better leveraging information on root causes of security deficiencies and corrective actions. For example, GAO found that the Open Standards and Recommended Practices Findings Tool (OSFT)\u2014a database for tracking the resolution status of identified foreign airport deficiencies\u2014has gaps and its system for categorization does not result in sufficient specificity of information related to security deficiencies' root causes and corrective actions. Root causes represent the underlying reason why an airport is not meeting an ICAO standard and, according to TSA documentation, fall into three general categories: lack of knowledge, lack of infrastructure, and lack of will. For example, a foreign airport might fail to meet an ICAO standard because of lack of knowledge stemming from insufficient training programs or a high rate of staff turnover. TSA could better leverage this information for trend analysis, including evaluating potential linkages between root causes and corrective actions, and determining the extent to which airports that received specific types of capacity development services were able to close security vulnerabilities. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that TSA (1) ensure that data regarding the root causes of security deficiencies and corrective actions are consistently captured in accordance with TSA guidance, and (2) update its data systems to include more specific categories for TSA's data on the root causes and corrective actions related to security deficiencies. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-64": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's labs provide the nation's scientific and engineering expertise to support warfighter needs and develop transformative capabilities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of these authorities. This report examines (1) how DOD labs have used selected authorities to foster innovation and efficiency and identify what barriers impede their use; (2) identifies and describes governance models used by selected DOD-sponsored federally funded research centers and university affiliated research centers; and (3) identifies and describes governance models used non-defense labs, specifically at the Department of Energy and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. GAO surveyed DOD lab directors and analyzed relevant DOD and service policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed DOD and lab officials. What GAO Found Most defense labs have used the selected authorities to foster innovation and efficiency and identify what barriers impede their use. For example, most labs have used the laboratory initiated research authority, which provides lab directors with the means to fund some of the research projects that the lab will pursue. However, GAO found that most labs are not using the full 4 percent of all funds available to each lab, or charging customers the full fixed percentage fee of 4 percent of costs, as allowed by law. Specifically, GAO found that Navy labs reported charging customers a percentage fee of about 2 percent of costs as of fiscal year 2018. The Air Force Research Laboratory reported that it is not charging customers the allowable fixed percentage fee of costs to fund science and technology activities because it does not have a mechanism in place to do so. By not assessing the potential costs and benefits related to the options for collecting these allowable fees, the Air Force could be missing out on a potential source of funding to support its needs. DOD labs have used direct hire authorities to hire qualified candidates for key scientific positions, but experienced delays. For example, the Navy's research laboratory has not yet established a pilot program for its labs. The Army has not yet established a laboratory enhancement pilot program. DOD sponsors several research centers, which are governed through noncompetitive agreements, including contracts. These centers provide the department with access to scientific experts employed by universities and other non-profit organizations. Scientists employed by these external to DOD research centers\u2014specifically, three lab federally funded research centers and 13 university affiliated research centers\u2014execute DOD-funded science and technology development projects in emerging technical areas. DOD staff oversee these centers using routine oversight of funded research tasks and comprehensive reviews, which help DOD determine whether the centers' funding should continue. DOD-sponsored research centers are governed by noncompetitive agreements, including contracts. These centers provide the department with access to scientific experts employed by universities and other non-profit organizations. Scientists employed by these external to DOD research centers\u2014specifically, three lab federally funded research centers and 13 university affiliated research centers\u2014execute DOD-funded science and technology development projects in emerging technical areas. DOD and research center officials told GAO that their ability to authorize work at the FFRDCs that DOD sponsors is limited by legislative restrictions on the staffing levels at these centers, as well as by infrastructure modernization challenges they face. The Department of Energy (Energy) primarily relies on contractor-operated federally funded research centers to operate its labs, while the majority of NASA labs and centers are government-operated. Energy's national labs form the core of the agency's scientific work and mission. This is in contrast to DOD-funded labs, which constitute a relatively small aspect of DOD's overall mission. NASA centers can also approve and fund certain facility projects, in accordance with NASA policies, and they have encountered significant challenges with aging infrastructure. Also, in some cases, energy and space research centers have significant challenges with hiring replacement staff and competing with private sector employers for staff. NASA centers were previously provided hiring flexibilities by Congress in 2004 to facilitate staff hiring. While Energy and NASA's research entities follow their specific governance models, there are broad characteristics common across these agencies as well as DOD. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Air Force assess the potential costs and benefits of implementing accounting system improvements that would allow the Air Force Research Laboratory to charge customers a fixed percentage fee on provided science and technology activities to the extent allowed under the laboratory initiated research authority. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-29": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews identified a lack of comprehensive oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise. In response, the Secretary of Defense directed DOD to address the recommendations from the 2014 reviews and directed CAPE to track and assess these implementation efforts. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. This report examines (1) DOD's progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and (2) the extent to which DOD has taken steps to improve oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise. GAO reviewed relevant DOD guidance and documents, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to make progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and has made improvements in tracking and evaluating this progress. Specifically, the military services and other DOD components have begun identifying and documenting risks associated with implementing recommendations from the 2014 reviews, based on guidance that was issued by the Center for Acquisition and Program Evaluation (CAPE) in January 2018. DOD has also made progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (NC3) report. For example, the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) issued guidance in July 2018 to improve the tracking and evaluation of DOD's progress in implementing the recommendations of the NC3 report. DOD and the military services have taken steps to improve oversight of the defense nuclear enterprise, in part in response to recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews. DOD plans to use the NDERG to oversee long-term and enduring issues affecting the nuclear enterprise. However, the NDERG does not have formally defined roles and responsibilities, and DOD has not established methods for how the NDERG will communicate and collaborate with the other nuclear enterprise oversight organizations. Further, DOD NC3 oversight guidance has not been updated to reflect evolving NC3 oversight roles and responsibilities and to include methods for communicating and collaborating with other nuclear enterprise oversight groups. Unless DOD is able to align the roles and responsibilities of the many entities now charged with oversight functions, the department's leadership may not be in a position to be informed of issues affecting the nuclear enterprise or the NC3 enterprise and may be unable to make effective resourcing decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) identify roles and responsibilities for the NDERG and (2) update its guidance to clarify roles and responsibilities and methods for communication and collaboration among oversight organizations. DOD concurred with all four of GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-135T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible for overseeing passenger railroads' implementation of PTC, which is intended to prevent train-to-train collisions, derailments due to excessive speed, and incursions into work zone limits. FRA has established a deadline for PTC implementation, which is December 31, 2018, if railroads meet six criteria set forth in statute. GAO was asked to testify on the status of PTC implementation. This statement addresses (1) the status of PTC implementation and (2) the extent to which passenger railroads and FRA are working toward an extension. This statement is based on GAO's March 2018 report, which examined PTC implementation and FRA's efforts to ensure compliance with PTC deadlines. GAO reviewed FRA documents and interviewed FRA officials and representatives from passenger railroads. GAO also interviewed FRA officials and representatives from 13 passenger railroads selected based on their PTC implementation status. What GAO Found As of June 30, 2018, many passenger railroads reported that they remain in the equipment installation and field-testing stages, which are early stages of PTC implementation. However, since GAO testified in March 2018, railroads have made progress on equipment installation. Specifically, 20 of the 29 passenger railroads reported being more than 90 percent complete with locomotive equipment installation. Nearly two-thirds of passenger railroads that must install wayside equipment reported being more than 90 percent complete. One-third of passenger railroads are among those designated by FRA as at-risk of both not meeting the end of 2018 implementation deadline and not completing the requirements necessary to qualify for an extension. Specifically, in August 2018, FRA identified nine railroads\u2014all commuter railroads\u2014as at-risk, fewer than the 12 railroads FRA had previously designated as at-risk in its June 2018 letters to railroads. FRA has recently clarified the requirements for an extension to passenger railroads. Almost three-quarters of passenger railroads (21 of 29) reported to GAO that they plan to apply for an extension. Five passenger railroads reported to GAO that they planned to submit their extension request by the end of September 2018, but as of September 21, 2018, only one had submitted the request and required documentation. However, FRA officials noted that with the exception of possibly one or two railroads, they anticipate that all passenger and freight railroads will likely need an extension, and that railroads must submit their requests by the end of the year to be considered in compliance with PTC requirements. FRA's already substantial workload is expected to increase as railroads continue to submit documentation necessary for extensions and continue PTC implementation activities. FRA is focused on ensuring railroads are in compliance by the December 2018 deadline\u2014whether via an extension or by completing implementation. While FRA officials report that they anticipate almost all railroads will likely request an extension, only one passenger railroad had submitted an application for an extension as of September 21, 2018. FRA will need to review and approve all related documentation associated with each extension request and make a determination within 90 days, meaning if a railroad were to submit its extension request on December 31, 2018, FRA would have until the end of March 2019 to approve or deny the railroad's extension request. In addition, many passenger railroads will also be submitting to FRA: requests for substitute criteria, test requests to initiate field testing or revenue service demonstration, revisions to PTC implementation plans, and PTC safety plans. Some of these documents can be lengthy and require back and forth between FRA and railroads before approval. FRA officials told GAO that in trying to manage their workload, they initially told railroads they did not have time to review draft submittals, but they found that taking the time to conduct draft reviews ultimately led to higher quality formal submittals and accelerated the overall review process. In addition, FRA officials told GAO that they reallocated resources to shift PTC specialists' responsibilities to focus exclusively on testing-related activities because their involvement is critical for the testing stage. Taking steps to prioritize limited resources will only increase in importance as the amount of documentation needing FRA review continues to grow in 2019 and 2020, as railroads move through testing and submit complex and lengthy safety plans. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to FRA to improve its oversight of PTC implementation. FRA has taken some actions in response to GAO's March 2018 recommendation that it better prioritize resources, but FRA resources and review times remain a significant concern\u2014both for near-term efforts such as extension requests and for the safety plans that need to be reviewed and certified prior to the end of 2020. These issues\u2014combined with the ongoing implementation, testing, and interoperability challenges that a number of railroads reported to GAO\u2014rais",
    "gao_GAO-18-84": "Why GAO Did This Study EPA has encouraged states to use nutrient credit trading to help address nutrient pollution. Trading allows a point source to purchase pollutant reduction credits from another point source or a nonpoint source in the same watershed with the intent of meeting the discharge limits established in an NPDES permit. The Clean Water Act does not explicitly identify trading as an option to comply with NPDES permits. GAO was asked to review nutrient credit trading. This report (1) examines the extent to which nutrient credit trading programs have been used and what the outcomes of the programs have been, (2) describes how states and EPA oversee nutrient credit programs, and (3) describes what key factors stakeholders view as affecting participation in nutrient credit trading. GAO reviewed EPA data and state laws and regulations, analyzed state data, and interviewed EPA officials and stakeholders. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of three nutrient credit trading programs in three states. What GAO Found According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2014, a total of 19 nutrient credit trading programs existed in 11 states. The majority of nutrient credit trades occurred in 3 states\u2014Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Most point sources participating in these 3 state programs in 2014 did not purchase credits. However, EPA and state officials and stakeholders told GAO that trading provided point sources with flexibility that allowed them to manage risk, reduce the cost of compliance, and better manage the timing of upgrades of their nutrient removal technology. States oversee nutrient credit trading programs by approving and verifying credit generation to ensure that credits represent real nutrient pollution reductions. EPA reviews permits, conducts periodic evaluations of point source facilities to ensure that trading is consistent with the Clean Water Act, and issues national-level guidance for nutrient credit trading. EPA reviews permits, conducts periodic evaluations of point source facilities, and issues national-level guidance for nutrient credit trading. Stakeholders cited two key factors that have affected participation in nutrient credit trading\u2014the presence of discharge limits for nutrients and the challenges of measuring nutrient reductions resulting from nonpoint sources' implementation of best management practices (BMP). First, officials from the three states GAO reviewed, and other stakeholders, cited the importance of discharge limits for nutrients as a driver to create demand for nutrient credit trading. Second, officials from the three states GAO reviewed, and other stakeholders, cited the challenges of measuring nutrient reductions resulting from nonpoint sources' implementation of BMPs. Unlike point sources, the Clean Water Act does not require nonpoint sources to meet nutrient discharge limits established in nutrient discharge limits or numeric water quality standards, and as a result, EPA said there is no federal regulatory driver creating demand for nonpoint sources to participate in nutrient credit trading programs. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. EPA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-593": "Why GAO Did This Study The Forest Service and BLM manage federal lands under their jurisdiction for various uses, including timber harvesting. The Forest Service and BLM have policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution. GAO was asked to review the extent to which the agencies have implemented the ban on federal timber export and substitution. This report examines (1) the extent to which the agencies have implemented the ban on federal timber export and substitution, and (2) the extent to which the agencies have issued new regulations as required by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997 and the agencies' policies and practices for preventing, detecting, and responding to illegal timber export and substitution. GAO reviewed agency policies and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations. What GAO Found The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) found no violations of the ban on federal timber export and substitution from 2007 through 2017. Forest Service officials described instances in which the agency responded to reports of potential violations, but the reports were not substantiated. All agency officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed said that the likelihood of illegal timber export and substitution is low. However, several officials acknowledged that some risk of violations exists under certain circumstances. For example, some Forest Service regional officials said that some national forests could be vulnerable to illegal timber export if log prices or demand for certain tree species increase in the future. The Forest Service and BLM neither issued new regulations as required by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1997 nor obtained legislative relief from the requirement. The agencies have policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution. However, some policies are outdated or unclear, and the agencies have not reviewed their policies for continued relevance and effectiveness. For example, Forest Service policy requires that one end of most unprocessed logs be painted and branded before the logs are removed from the timber sale area. BLM policy requires that one end of most unprocessed logs be painted and branded, but does not allow contracting officers to waive the marking requirement. Without issuing new coordinated and consistent regulations as required by the 1997 act, or obtaining legislative relief, the agencies will continue to be out of compliance with this provision of the act. The Forest Service and BLM have policies and practices to help prevent, detect, and respond to illegal timber export and substitution. However, some policies are outdated or unclear, and the agencies have not reviewed their policies for continued relevance and effectiveness. For example, Forest Service policy calls for collecting a certification form that expired in 1999, and BLM policy does not clearly define what constitutes a violation of the export ban. By reviewing agency policies and making changes to them as necessary, the Forest Service and BLM will have better assurance that their policies are relevant and effective for addressing the risk of illegal timber export and substitution. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Forest Service and BLM (1) determine whether new regulations are appropriate, (2) issue them in accordance with the 1997 act, and (3) review their policies for continued relevance and effectiveness. The agencies generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-466": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government faces a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT talent to implement and oversee information security protections to combat cyber threats. The Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 required OPM to develop a cybersecurity coding structure and provide a progress report to Congress on the implementation of the act. The act also required GAO to review the implementation of the act. This report examines (1) whether OPM developed a coding structure and procedures for assigning codes to cybersecurity positions and submitted a progress report to Congress, (2) Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies submitted complete and reliable baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces, and (3) CFO Act agencies established procedures to identify and assign codes to cybersecurity positions. GAO reviewed OPM's cybersecurity coding structure, procedures, and progress reports; analyzed available baseline assessments from 24 CFO Act agencies; and interviewed cognizant agency officials. What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed a cybersecurity coding structure, issued guidance to implement the coding structure to identify all federal civilian cybersecurity positions, and provided a progress report to Congress on the implementation of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015. However, the coding structure and procedures were issued later than the act's deadlines because OPM was working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to align the structure and procedures with the draft version of the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, which NIST issued later than planned. The delays in issuing the coding structure and the government-wide coding procedures have extended the due dates for agencies to implement other provisions of the act by about 4 months. Most of the 24 CFO Act agencies conducted baseline assessments identifying the extent to which their cybersecurity employees held certifications and submitted them to Congress as required by the act. However, 3 agencies did not complete the assessments for various reasons, such as a lack of resources and tools to do so. Further, of the 21 agencies that did complete the assessments, 4 agencies did not address all of the reportable information, such as the extent to which personnel without certifications were ready to obtain them or strategies for mitigating any gaps. In addition, the assessments conducted by the 21 agencies did not contain complete, comprehensive, or consistent information on the certifications held by agencies' cybersecurity employees due to limitations in the ability of the agencies to collect the needed information. As a result, the information collected and reported by most agencies about the certifications held by agency cybersecurity personnel may be of limited value for assessing the qualifications and skills of their cybersecurity workforces. Most CFO Act agencies established procedures to identify all of their civilian positions and assign the appropriate cybersecurity employment codes to the positions as called for by the act. However, 6 agencies' procedures did not fully address 1 or more of 7 activities required by OPM, such as the activities to review all encumbered and vacant positions and annotate reviewed position descriptions with the appropriate employment code. Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) did not establish procedures for coding noncivilian cybersecurity positions. By not developing coding procedures that address all of the required activities in their procedures, these agencies may not have reasonable assurance that they will fully realize the benefits of (1) comprehensively identifying the cybersecurity workforce, and (2) applying the employment codes to meet the intended goal of defining the workforce and helping to address critical mission needs. What GAO Recommends GAO is making 30 recommendations to 13 agencies to develop and submit their baseline assessments and to fully address the required activities in OPM's guidance in their procedures for assigning employment codes to cybersecurity positions. Of the 13 agencies, 7 agreed with all of the recommendations directed to them; 1 agency agreed with one and did not agree with one recommendation; 2 agencies provided comments but did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with the recommendations; 2 agencies provided comments but did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with the recommendations; and 1 agency did not respond to GAO's request for comments on the report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-383T": "Why GAO Did This Study The growth of e-commerce has accelerated the pace at which counterfeiters can gain access to consumers or reinvent themselves if shut down. This shift has been accompanied by changes in the ways in which counterfeit goods are sold. GAO was asked to review the changes in the marketplace for counterfeit goods. This statement addresses (1) the changes in the market for counterfeit goods, (2) the challenges that these changes pose to U.S. agencies, consumers, and the private sector, and (3) the extent to which CBP and ICE collaborate on IPR enforcement. This statement is based on GAO's January 2018 report, Counterfeit Goods: Challenges to U.S. Agencies, Consumers, and the Private Sector, GAO-2018-02 (Washington, D.C.: January 18, 2018). GAO reviewed CBP and ICE data and interviewed CBP and ICE officials. GAO also purchased a nongeneralizable sample of four types of consumer products from third-party sellers on five popular e-commerce websites. GAO did not identify any clear reasons for the variation among the counterfeit and authentic items that GAO purchased based on the products that they represented, the e-commerce websites where GAO bought the items, or the third-party sellers from whom GAO bought them. GAO also reviewed the customer ratings of third-party sellers from whom GAO bought the items. GAO identified a number of key challenges that the changes in the market for counterfeit goods can pose to U.S. agencies and the private sector. First, the increasing sophistication of counterfeits can make it difficult for law enforcement officers to distinguish between legitimate and counterfeit goods. Second, as the range of counterfeit goods expands, CBP has a wider variety of goods to screen, which requires CBP officials to have in-depth knowledge of a broad range of products and of how to identify counterfeits. Third, counterfeiters may break up large shipments into multiple smaller express carrier or mail packages to decrease the risk of losing significant quantities of merchandise to a single seizure. This shift poses challenges to CBP and ICE because, according to CBP officials, seizure processing requires roughly the same amount of time and resources regardless of shipment size or value. Second, the changing marketplace also presents challenges to the private sector, according to representatives from rights holders and e-commerce websites. For example, it is more difficult for rights holders and e-commerce websites to identify and investigate individual counterfeit cases, because e-commerce websites face a growing inventory from a larger registry of sellers. Tracking goods from known counterfeiters through various website fulfillment and delivery mechanisms is also a significant challenge for the private sector. Furthermore, the growth of e-commerce has accelerated the pace at which counterfeiters can gain access to consumers or reinvent themselves if shut down. What GAO Found The growth of e-commerce has contributed to a fundamental change in the market for counterfeit goods, according to GAO analysis of documents from CBP, ICE, and international organizations and GAO interviews with CBP and ICE officials. U.S. agencies and international organizations have observed a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods from \u201cunderground\u201d or secondary markets, such as flea markets or sidewalk vendors, to primary markets, including e-commerce websites, corporate and government supply chains, and traditional retail stores. Whereas secondary markets are often characterized by consumers who are knowingly purchasing counterfeits, primary markets involve counterfeiters who try to deceive consumers into purchasing goods they believe are authentic. This shift has been accompanied by changes in the ways in which counterfeit goods are sold. In the past, consumers could often rely on indicators such as the location of sale or the goods' appearance or price to identify counterfeit goods in the marketplace. However, counterfeiters have now adopted new ways to deceive consumers. For example, as consumers increasingly purchase goods online, counterfeiters may exploit third-party online marketplaces to gain an appearance of legitimacy and access to consumers. Additionally, by setting the price of a counterfeit at, or close to, the retail price of a genuine good, counterfeiters may deceive consumers, who will pay the higher price because they believe the goods are real or who believe that they are getting a slight bargain on genuine goods. According to CBP data and CBP officials, the volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods seized by CBP and ICE have changed in recent years. CBP reports indicate that the number of IPR seizures increased by 38 percent in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. According to CBP data, approximately 88 percent of IPR seizures made during this period were shipped from China and Hong Kong. The variety of products being counterfeited has also increased, according to CBP data. In an attempt to illustrate the risk",
    "gao_GAO-18-580": "Why GAO Did This Study IHS provides health services to members of AI/AN tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS provides these services directly through a network of hospitals, clinics and health stations, while also providing funds to tribally operated facilities. GAO was asked to review IHS's efforts to recruit and retain providers. This report examines (1) the number of vacancies for providers in IHS areas, (2) the strategies IHS uses to recruit and retain providers, and (3) the extent to which IHS uses strategies to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout when positions are vacant. GAO analyzed IHS data on vacancies and interviewed IHS officials. GAO also visited seven IHS facilities selected based on geographic location and size. What GAO Found The Indian Health Service (IHS) data show large percentages of vacancies for providers in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities. As of November 2017, the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists in these areas was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. However, variation in vacancy rates existed among provider types across IHS areas. For example, while the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians across these 8 areas exceeded 25 percent, the vacancy rate for pharmacists was less than 25 percent. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although 29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although 29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although 29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. IHS officials told GAO they have experienced considerable challenges in filling vacancies for providers\u2014as well as negative effects on patient care and provider satisfaction when positions are vacant. According to IHS officials, the rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS officials stated that the rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS officials said that, especially for job candidates and employees with families, these can be critical factors in choosing whether or not to accept or stay in a position. IHS uses multiple strategies to recruit and retain providers, including financial incentives, professional development opportunities, and some access to housing. The agency has also taken steps to recruit students and connect with potential applicants through webinars, career fairs, and conferences. IHS uses strategies to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout when positions are vacant. Specifically, IHS provides telehealth services; implements alternative staffing models, including hiring nurse practitioners and physician assistants in lieu of physicians; temporarily assigns Commissioned Corps officers to alternate duty stations as needed; and contracts with temporary providers. IHS officials told GAO they regularly use temporary contract providers\u2014such as through locum tenens contracts and contracts with university fellowship programs\u2014to maintain patient access to care when positions are vacant. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-165": "Why GAO Did This Study Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 requires DOD to take actions to improve its business operations. Section 911 also requires GAO to report on DOD's efforts to reform its business operations. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of section 911. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's implementation of section 911 and (2) the extent to which DOD has established cross-functional teams to implement business reform initiatives. GAO reviewed DOD's implementation of section 911 and related reports, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has made limited progress since June 2018 in implementing the requirements of section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 and is reducing the number of cross-functional teams it considers responsive to section 911. Section 911 requires DOD to issue its organizational strategy, issue guidance on cross-functional teams, provide training on cross-functional teams for team members and their supervisors, and provide training for presidential appointees. DOD plans to address three of the five remaining requirements by March 2019. Specifically, the department plans to issue its organizational strategy in March 2019\u201418 months later than required by section 911. DOD has drafted, but not issued, guidance on cross-functional teams, which section 911 required to be issued by September 2017. In June 2018, GAO reported that DOD officials had revised the draft guidance to address the recommendation from GAO's February 2018 report, including identifying potential action steps for the department that align with GAO's leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations. OCMO officials stated that they expect the Secretary of Defense to issue the guidance in March 2019\u201418 months later than required by section 911. DOD continues to implement its nine cross-functional teams dedicated to reforming and improving business operations, but plans to no longer consider these teams as responsive to section 911. The National Defense Business Operations Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022 highlights nine cross-functional teams as key mechanisms for implementing the plan's strategic objective to improve and strengthen business operations through a move to enterprise or shared services. DOD has made some progress establishing and organizing the business reform teams, but implementation of the teams' initiatives has been uneven. GAO found that implementation of the business reform teams has demonstrated some key characteristics of leading practices for implementing effective cross-functional teams that GAO has identified in prior work. For example, across all the teams GAO spoke with, members were responsible for leading the development of their team's initiatives and communicating with their home organizations to obtain input, demonstrating a well-defined team structure. In addition, the business reform teams are structured to facilitate open and regular communication, another leading practice. However, GAO found that the business reform teams' efforts have not proceeded according to early plans outlined by the department. DOD's August 2017 report to Congress on restructuring the Chief Management Officer (CMO) organization stated that the teams were intended to help modify processes to move toward enterprise service delivery. According to the report, the department would transition to DOD enterprise services by the end of fiscal year 2018. In July 2018, OCMO officials acknowledged that they were behind schedule, but told GAO they expected to catch up to this deadline by the end of fiscal year 2018, as originally planned. That deadline was not realized. According to OCMO officials, the teams are identifying new milestones for implementing initiatives, some of which will contribute to a move toward enterprise services. Further, the teams' progress in advancing their initiatives to the implementation and monitoring phase has varied. For example, while some teams have successfully advanced several initiatives to gate 4, others have not yet progressed initiatives past gate 2. Specifically, as of September 2018, DOD reported that 104 of the teams' 135 initiatives had not yet reached gate 3, the implementation phase. According to the teams GAO spoke with, several factors may affect the progress of an initiative, such as its complexity or a team's approach to developing initiatives. GAO found that uncertainty with funding for initiatives may be an additional factor inhibiting some teams' progress. For example, in June 2018, one team leader told GAO that the team did not have sufficient funding to implement four initiatives. The team leader also stated that the team was not alerted to the lack of funding until immediately prior to its planned implementation of these initiatives. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD establish a process for identifying and prioritizing available funding to develop and implement initiatives from the cross-functional reform teams. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-623T": "Why GAO Did This Study VHA is responsible for ensuring that the nation's health care system is adequately staffed. VHA has a large physician workforce, with more than 11,000 physicians employed by VHA and about 2,800 physicians employed by VAMCs. VHA also provides physician services through fee-basis arrangements or contracts. GAO was asked to review VHA's physician workforce. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which VHA has data on the total number of mission-critical physicians who provide care at VAMCs and (2) the extent to which VHA has developed guidance for determining its staffing needs for all physicians. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, which examined VHA's physician workforce and physician recruitment and retention. GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed VHA officials. What GAO Found In its October 2017 report, GAO found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) had data on the number of mission-critical physicians it employed (more than 11,000) and who provided services on a fee-basis (about 2,800), but lacked data on the number of contract physicians and physician trainees. As a result, VHA did not have data on the extent to which VAMCs used these arrangements and thus, underestimated its physician use overall. Therefore, VHA was unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed any gaps in staffing. VHA gave responsibility for determining staffing needs to its VAMCs and provided its facilities with guidance, through policies and directives, on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations. Specifically, VHA provided this guidance for primary care, mental health, and emergency medicine, but lacked sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties, including occupations such as gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery. For these occupations, VHA provided guidance on the minimum number of physicians, but did not provide information on how to determine appropriate staffing levels for physicians or support staff based on the need for care. For these occupations, VHA provided guidance on the minimum number of physicians, but did not provide information on how to determine appropriate staffing levels for physicians or support staff based on the need for care.

    "gao_GAO-18-482": "Why GAO Did This Study Job Corps is a federally funded program that provides job training and career development services to youth. In program year 2016, about 79,000 students were served by Job Corps. GAO was asked to review Job Corps safety and security. This report examines (1) what is known about the number and types of reported incidents involving the safety and security of Job Corps students in program year 2016, (2) what is known about student perceptions of safety and security at Job Corps centers, and (3) the extent to which ETA has taken steps to address safety and security at Job Corps centers. GAO analyzed ETA data on reported incidents, student perceptions of safety and security at Job Corps centers, and student perceptions of safety and security at Job Corps centers. GAO also interviewed ETA officials and visited two Job Corps centers. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of the Department of Labor's (DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) data showed that Job Corps centers reported 13,673 safety and security incidents involving students, including those that occurred both onsite and offsite, in program year 2016. During this time period, approximately 79,000 students were served by the program. Drug-related incidents (29 percent) and assaults (19 percent) accounted for 48 percent of all reported incidents involving students. The remaining 52 percent of reported incidents involving students included breaches of security and safety (12 percent), alcohol-related incidents (6 percent), serious illness and injury (6 percent), theft or damage to property (5 percent), danger to self or others (5 percent), and all other types of incidents (18 percent). GAO's analysis of ETA's data showed that 90 percent of the 13,673 reported safety and security incidents involving students occurred onsite at Job Corps centers, and 10 percent occurred at offsite locations. GAO's analysis of ETA's data showed that about 17,000 students were reported as victims or perpetrators of all onsite and offsite incidents in program year 2016. The majority of reported perpetrators were male, under age 20, and enrolled in Job Corps for less than 4 months. ETA plans to create a new, expanded survey to improve upon the prior survey. ETA officials said that the agency is creating a new survey to provide more timely and more detailed information. ETA officials said that the agency is developing a new survey to improve upon the prior survey. ETA officials said that the agency is developing a new risk-based monitoring strategy that identifies emerging problems that place a Job Corps center at-risk for safety and security problems.

ETA national officials said that ETA's new monitoring strategy has improved center monitoring because it has allowed them to more effectively direct resources to areas of greatest need. However, ETA national officials said that ETA's new monitoring strategy is not consistently implemented across regional offices. Without standard operating procedures or other relevant guidance, ETA cannot ensure that monitoring for center safety and security will be carried out uniformly across the program. As a result, centers may be held to different standards, and the program may not achieve its center safety and security goals. ETA officials agreed that a comprehensive plan is needed, but told GAO that limited staff capacity and lack of expertise have hindered their ability to produce a comprehensive plan. ETA officials said they plan to produce a comprehensive plan when they have secured the staff to do so. However, at this time, ETA does not have a specific timeframe for producing such a plan. Without a comprehensive plan, ETA risks the success of its new initiatives because they are not linked in an overall framework that demonstrates how they are aligned or contribute to goals for improving center safety and security. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that ETA (1) develop standard operating procedures for its risk-based monitoring strategy, (2) streamline existing monitoring reports, and (3) commit to a deadline for developing a comprehensive plan for Job Corps safety and security.

    "gao_GAO-18-175": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS is the third largest department in the federal government, employing approximately 240,000 people and with an annual budget of about $60 billion\u2014$6.4 billion of which was spent on IT in fiscal year 2017. DHS is required to assess its cybersecurity workforce. The act required DHS to identify all positions with cybersecurity functions and determine the work category and specialty areas of each position. The act also required DHS to submit to OPM an annual report that describes and substantiates critical need designations. GAO was asked to review DHS's efforts to identify its cybersecurity workforce. This report addresses the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized and assigned employment codes to (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. GAO analyzed DHS's cybersecurity workforce data and documentation, and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has begun activities related to identifying, categorizing, and assigning the appropriate employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. However, DHS has not completed all of these activities, as required. Specifically, the department did not develop timely and complete procedures or review its components' procedures. In addition, it did not completely and reliably identify and assign employment codes because its processes were manual, undocumented, and resource-intensive. As of August 2017\u201423 months after the due date\u2014the department had not completed the process of assigning the 2-digit employment codes to all of its identified cybersecurity positions. For example, five of the six components GAO selected for review had not yet completed the coding of their cybersecurity positions. In addition, DHS did not completely or accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions as required by the act. For example, DHS could not demonstrate that it had assigned codes to 95 percent of its positions, as reported, since its coding progress data never indicated such a percentage. The percentage of coded positions reported for DHS was overstated because it was not based on complete information. Specifically, the percentage reflected information on the progress of filled federal civilian cybersecurity positions, but excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions. Among the six components that GAO selected for review, five had not yet completed the coding of their cybersecurity positions. Without the ability to code its cybersecurity positions in a complete and accurate manner, DHS will not be able to effectively examine the cybersecurity workforce; identify skill gaps; and improve workforce planning. DHS has identified workforce capacity and capability gaps, but it has not identified or reported to Congress its department-wide cybersecurity critical needs that align with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework. Specifically, DHS has not identified its cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need in alignment with the NICE framework. Further, DHS has not developed and provided guidance to help its component-level agencies identify their cybersecurity critical needs. Moreover, DHS has not reported its critical needs to OPM or developed plans and time frames for completing priority actions for reporting critical needs annually to OPM. Until DHS addresses these issues, it may continue to miss reporting deadlines and be hindered from effectively identifying and prioritizing critical workforce efforts to recruit, hire, train, develop, and retain cybersecurity personnel across its multiple components. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS develop procedures on how to identify and code its cybersecurity positions; develop guidance to assist its component agencies and offices in identifying their cybersecurity critical needs; and develop plans with time frames to report its cybersecurity critical needs. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-523": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy plans to retire CVN 65 in the next decade. CVN 65 is the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier requiring dismantlement and disposal. The Navy is considering two options for CVN 65: (1) a naval shipyard option and (2) a full commercial option. GAO was asked to review the Navy's plans and decisions for CVN 65. This report (1) describes the differences between the dismantlement and disposal options under consideration, including cost and schedule as well as workload and facilities; (2) evaluates the Navy's funding and reporting practices for dismantlement and disposal activities; and (3) assesses the effect that nuclear regulatory authority considerations have on dismantlement and disposal options for CVN 65. GAO analyzed Navy documentation on CVN 65, interviewed Navy and commercial company officials, and analyzed Navy and commercial cost and schedule estimates. What GAO Found The Navy is weighing a number of considerations before making a decision for CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal. The naval shipyard option offers well-established processes for dismantling the ship's nuclear material and better understood cost and schedule estimates than the full commercial option. GAO's analysis of available data, however, found that the naval shipyard option would contribute to existing workload backlogs and exacerbate facility challenges at the shipyard that could affect its work maintaining the active fleet\u2014a Navy priority. While the Navy has not defined its requirements for the full commercial option, industry does not expect to face workload or facility challenges. Navy officials also believe that the full commercial option potentially could shorten the timeline for completing the work and reduce the total cost. The Navy's approach typically used to budget for and report on ship dismantlement and disposal does not provide sufficient information to support decision makers' oversight of CVN 65\u2014a multi-year project that may require more than $1 billion to complete. GAO found the Navy is not required to provide detailed budget information or report dismantlement and disposal cost, schedule, and programmatic information to decision makers. Providing additional information through budget requests and reporting would help ensure that decision makers have sufficient information to oversee CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal activities and to support future decisions. The Navy's evaluation of CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal options is hampered by a regulatory authority disagreement. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) stated its disagreement that it or an agreement state is able to serve as the regulatory authority for CVN 65, emphasizing that regulatory responsibility for the safe processing and disposal of Navy ships falls to Naval Reactors under its Department of Energy authority. Naval Reactors officials stated that for the full commercial option, their responsibility to provide for processing and disposal of the byproduct material\u2014which Naval Reactors indicated is what remains on CVN 65\u2014can be best met by contracting with commercial companies licensed by NRC or an agreement state. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense (1) ensure that the Navy provides additional information in the annual President's budget exhibits associated with CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal to facilitate improved transparency and accountability; (2) require the Navy to obtain an independent cost estimate for both the naval shipyard and full commercial options before choosing a dismantlement and disposal approach for CVN 65; and (3) require the Navy to approve a cost and schedule baseline prior to beginning the CVN 65 dismantlement and disposal.

This report (1) addresses the extent to which identified streamlining provisions had an impact on the time frames for the environmental consulting and permitting processes; (2) identifies actions taken by the resource agencies to streamline their consulting and permitting reviews and identifies additional streamlining opportunities, if any; and (3) describes the actions taken by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to accelerate highway and transportation projects. GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and guidance; analyzed agency data on consultations and permits; and interviewed federal and state officials. What GAO Found The federal government has enacted a number of statutory provisions aimed at streamlining the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. However, a lack of reliable agency data regarding consultation and permit review time frames hinders a quantitative analysis of the provisions' impact. For example, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) data were not sufficiently reliable for examining the impact of the streamlining provisions on the time frames for completing consultations. Further, limitations in FWS and NMFS data, such as missing or incorrect data and inconsistent data entry practices, could impair the agencies' ability to determine whether the agencies are meeting statutory and regulatory requirements, such as the extent to which the agencies complete formal consultations and issue biological opinions within 135 days. FWS and NMFS have limited controls that would help ensure the completeness and accuracy of their data. Officials at 19 of the 23 federal resource agency field offices and state DOTs GAO spoke with generally mentioned two additional actions, beyond the 18 provisions, for streamlining the consultation and permitting process: field office assistance to lead federal agencies and project sponsors, including state DOTs, to improve applications for permits and consultations; and electronic systems for environmental screening and document submission. For example, some state agencies created electronic systems for permitting and consultation applications, which can include multiple reports and studies related to an endangered species or its critical habitat. DOT officials stated that they continue to seek additional opportunities for their field offices to streamline the permitting and consultation processes, according to officials at 11 of the 16 field offices. However, beyond the streamlining actions and provisions cited above, officials at resource agency field offices and state DOTs did not identify additional opportunities used by multiple field offices to streamline permits and consultations. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service develop plans and time frames for improving their consultation tracking systems and develop appropriate internal controls to ensure accurate data on the time taken for consultations. The Departments of Commerce and Interior agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-34": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies are responsible for preventing, detecting, and responding to fraud. FRDAA requires agencies to establish financial and administrative controls to manage fraud risks. GAO was asked to review agencies' efforts to implement FRDAA. This report examines (1) federal agencies' progress and challenges in implementing fraud risk management practices, including those required by FRDAA, and (2) the extent to which OMB has taken steps that complied with FRDAA requirements and that facilitated agencies' implementation of the act. GAO surveyed 72 agencies subject to FRDAA, reviewed OMB guidance and a roundtable discussion with selected agencies, and interviewed OMB staff and subject-matter experts. What GAO Found Agencies have taken steps to manage fraud risks at the agency-wide level\u2014and in response to the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA)\u2014but have identified challenges. FRDAA requires agencies to establish financial and administrative controls that incorporate leading practices from the Fraud Risk Framework, including conducting an evaluation of fraud risks and using a risk-based approach to design and implement financial and administrative control activities to mitigate identified fraud risks. Agencies also reported on their progress identifying risks and vulnerabilities to fraud. These include payroll, beneficiary payments, grants, large contracts, and purchase and travel cards. Agencies reported on their progress establishing strategies, procedures, and other steps to curb fraud. However, the completeness and detail of reporting varied because some reports did not completely address all of the elements specified in the act. For example, each of the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies reported on their progress in establishing financial and administrative fraud controls required by FRDAA, but 7 agencies did not report on progress in implementing the fraud risk principle in the Standards for Internal Control. Agencies also reported that they did not have any new controls in response to FRDAA. OMB has taken steps to establish guidelines and a working group for agencies, as required by FRDAA, but limited guidelines and working-group coordination hindered some agencies' implementation of the act. Specifically, OMB issued guidelines for agencies to implement FRDAA's requirement to establish controls and report on their progress and has established a FRDAA working group, but agencies indicated the need for additional guidance and involvement in working-group activities. GAO's analysis of survey responses, roundtable discussion results, and agencies' annual financial reports indicates that (1) agencies had mixed perspectives on the usefulness of OMB's guidelines for agencies to establish controls; (2) limited details in OMB's reporting guidelines contributed to CFO Act agencies' incomplete and insufficiently detailed annual financial reports; and (3) agencies had challenges implementing FRDAA in part due to their lack of involvement in and limited information sharing from the working group. In addition to FRDAA, OMB has issued guidance on other government-wide reform and burden-reduction initiatives that could shape how agencies address FRDAA implementation, such as reforms that may change the structure of agencies and related programs or how agencies collect data used in managing fraud risks. While it is still too early to determine the effect of these broader initiatives on agencies' efforts to implement FRDAA, GAO has previously reported that broader reform efforts can be leveraged by OMB and agencies to address the high-risk areas and government-wide challenges that present vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are in need of transformation. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB enhance the guidelines for agencies to establish the controls required by FRDAA, clarify the difference between FRDAA and enterprise risk management (ERM) requirements, and collaborate with agencies to determine what additional information agencies need to implement the controls. OMB staff disagreed with GAO's recommendations, stating that the guidance is sufficient because the act is not mentioned in the guidelines. GAO continues to believe that the recommendations are valid as discussed in the report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-311": "Why GAO Did This Study PPACA established PCORI to improve the quality and relevance of evidence through research to help patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakers make informed health care decisions. PCORI is required to identify research priorities, establish a research project agenda, fund research consistent with its research agenda, and disseminate research findings, among other responsibilities. PPACA also established a Trust Fund to fund these CER activities by PCORI and HHS through fiscal year 2019. GAO was asked to review PCORI's activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which PCORI has committed funds for CER activities, (2) the extent to which PCORI has disseminated and implemented its research findings, and (3) the extent to which HHS has funded these activities. GAO reviewed PCORI and HHS documents and interviewed officials from PCORI and HHS, as well as stakeholders from public and private payers, health care providers, and patient advocacy organizations. GAO also interviewed officials from PCORI and HHS. What GAO Found The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) committed about $1.6 billion (or 79 percent of its total award commitments of $2.0 billion) to awards for conducting patient-centered outcomes research (CER) and $325 million (or 16 percent) to awards for building data capacity for research. In addition, PCORI committed $93 million for engagement and workforce awards to involve stakeholders in the research process and expand the research workforce, and committed $12 million for awards to disseminate and implement its research findings. Awards for the dissemination and implementation of its research findings were limited as of the end of fiscal year 2017, as most of this research was still underway. PCORI officials told GAO that the institute attempts to manage its funds to ensure that its research awards are funded and managed through completion, including peer review and the distribution of research findings, in recognition of the time needed to conduct this research as well as the uncertainty regarding the total amount of funding available. PCORI officials told GAO that the institute supports the development of the PCORnet initiative in order to use existing medical records and claims data and to transform much of that data into a common data model to be used for clinical research, until such time when such data will have been standardized in electronic health records so that they can easily be used for research. In addition, PCORI committed $93 million for engagement and workforce awards to involve stakeholders in the research process and expand the research workforce, and committed $12 million for awards to disseminate and implement its research findings. Awards for the dissemination and implementation of its research findings were limited as of the end of fiscal year 2017, as most of this research was still underway. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2017, HHS's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) obligated about $260 million (or 58 percent of HHS's $448 million in total obligations) for the dissemination and implementation of CER findings. According to AHRQ officials, because most PCORI-funded research had not been completed by the end of fiscal year 2017, these efforts were primarily focused on the dissemination and implementation of research funded by other entities, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additionally, AHRQ obligated $94 million for efforts to train researchers on conducting CER, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) obligated $85 million for efforts to build data capacity for research. AHRQ and ASPE plan to obligate an additional $120 million for dissemination and implementation, training, building data capacity, and administrative activities during fiscal years 2018 through 2020. They expect to have $245 million available to fund ongoing and future CER activities, based on expected transfers from the Trust Fund in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-81": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has developed the GRF as a rapid response force available to respond to unforeseen contingencies or crises. While the GRF has responded to worldwide contingencies, GRF units have been primarily used to augment existing geographic combatant command capabilities. DOD has not assessed the risks it assumes by its reliance upon the GRF for augmenting combatant commanders' forces as opposed to having the GRF-assigned units available for allocation to a joint task force in response to a contingency. GAO was asked to review the extent to which (1) DOD has used the GRF and assessed any risks associated with its use; and (2) GRF-assigned units are trained to meet GRF missions, both individually and as a joint force. GAO reviewed the GRF EXORD and DOD's Joint Training Policy for the Armed Forces of the United States, and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has generally used the Global Response Force (GRF) 35 times in support of worldwide contingencies\u2014with 32 of those uses involving individual GRF units being deployed in support of or to augment combatant commander needs. However, according to Joint Staff officials overseeing the management of the GRF, DOD has not assessed the extent to which it assumes risk associated with the potential unavailability of GRF units for a short-notice deployment as a joint force in response to a contingency, given the predominant use of the GRF as a resource for combatant commands to obtain individual units. According to Joint Staff officials, deployment of select GRF units as part of a joint task force has occurred three times: once to Haiti in support of an earthquake humanitarian response, and twice to Afghanistan in July 2010 and June 2011 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. According to these officials, GRF capabilities in support of Haiti included command and control, security, and transportation and distribution of humanitarian supplies. GRF units in support of Operation Enduring Freedom provided force protection to coalition forces as well as train, advise, and assist capabilities. The predominant use\u201432 of 35 deployments\u2014of individual GRF units to augment a combatant commander's needs has, in turn, diminished the set of units available for mission scenarios related to the GRF's use as a tailorable joint force, and accordingly the capabilities available for inclusion under a GRF joint task force. Because DOD has not defined the risk it assumes in its use of GRF units, it cannot determine the likelihood that units used to augment combatant commanders' needs might be required to constitute a joint force composed of GRF units, nor has DOD defined the significance of the risk it incurs by not having a given capability available to the GRF. Further, although DOD has used the GRF primarily to augment combatant commanders' needs, risks for both uses should be identified and analyzed appropriately since neither use is prioritized over the other. Without conducting a risk assessment and taking steps to address any identified risks to accomplishing either of the two GRF uses, DOD's attempt to satisfy one of the two intended uses of the GRF may inadvertently hamper the other intended use. GRF units train individually to meet GRF missions, but there are no GRF-specific joint training exercises, and the individual GRF units have limited opportunities to train as part of an integrated joint force, according to DOD officials. Specifically, according to service officials, GRF readiness, and that of assigned units, is based on the assigned force's participation in their respective service training exercises and are generally focused on the respective units' core missions or functions. In addition to service-level training, GRF units can also participate in joint training exercises sponsored by one of the geographic combatant commands. These commands can give authoritative direction to subordinate commands and forces necessary to carry out missions assigned to the command, including over all aspects of joint training. However, if GRF units are service retained or assigned to different combatant commands, they would not all fall under the authority of a single commander that could direct joint training. Moreover, there are no specific GRF joint training exercises that provide opportunities for individual units assigned to the GRF to train as a tailorable joint task force. Specifically, according to service officials, GRF readiness, and that of assigned units, is based on the assigned force's participation in their respective service training exercises and are generally focused on the respective units' core missions or functions.

    "gao_GAO-18-271": "Why GAO Did This Study Imports flow into the U.S. market through a process that CBP facilitates and enforces, in collaboration with other federal agencies and companies, engaged in international trade. CBP's ACE is designed to automate the import and export phases of import processing. GAO was asked to review CBP's efforts to implement ACE. This report examines (1) the status of CBP's efforts to implement ACE since 2013, (2) CBP partner agencies' access to ACE and use of the system for import processing, (3) available information about any cost savings and trade enforcement benefits that have resulted from using ACE, and (4) the approach that will be used to manage ACE after core capabilities have been completed. GAO reviewed CBP documents and interviewed CBP and partner agency officials. GAO also reviewed CBP's ACE metrics and interviewed CBP and partner agency officials. What GAO Found U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has implemented core Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) capabilities since 2013, but delays in completing these capabilities have delayed implementation several times. CBP has deployed most of the capabilities it identified as core ACE, but has deferred deployment of collections\u2014a capability for collecting import duties, taxes, and fees\u2014while it considers alternative approaches to make this capability operational. CBP officials stated that the agency will continue to link the newly deployed post-release capabilities to collections while deciding how to proceed. CBP's partner agencies that CBP identified as having responsibility for clearing or licensing cargo have been granted some access to ACE data. However, the extent to which these agencies use the system varies, and agencies are continuing efforts to enhance their use of ACE. CBP and partner agency officials and trade community representatives told GAO that their use of ACE has reduced costs by increasing the efficiency of import processing. CBP and partner agency officials also reported that the system has strengthened their ability to enforce trade laws and regulations. CBP has developed metrics to estimate the value of efficiency gains associated with the use of some of the implemented ACE capabilities for itself and the trade community. CBP's metrics capture reductions in the time required for CBP staff to complete certain import processes now included in ACE and translate these efficiency gains into dollar values. CBP officials stated that they expect to have collected sufficient data in the near future to begin reporting on the estimated dollar value of efficiencies that partner agencies are realizing through ACE. CBP does not have a process in place to manage the continued development of ACE after it finished implementing most of the capabilities it identified as core. ACE users in CBP, partner agencies, and the trade community have identified a number of shortcomings in ACE and have suggested enhancements to address them. CBP has identified a small number of enhancements suggested by CBP staff or the trade community as near-term priorities and identified a number of others to consider for priority status. However, a substantial number of additional suggested enhancements, including submissions from partner agencies, remain unaddressed. Further, a process for prioritizing all suggested enhancements has not been established. Moreover, funding for the continued development of ACE after fiscal year 2018\u2014including funding to address most of the suggested enhancements\u2014has not been identified. CBP and its partner agencies are working to establish a management approach that includes processes for prioritizing and sharing the costs of operating and enhancing the system. However, it is unclear when these discussions will conclude or the extent to which they will resolve outstanding issues. Federal guidance calls for establishing the organizational structure necessary to achieve objectives, including compatible means of operating across agency boundaries. Until CBP, in collaboration with its partner agencies, finalizes an approach to post-core management of ACE that includes such processes, as well as time frames for implementing them, CBP, its partner agencies, and the trade community will not realize the full potential benefits of the substantial investment ACE represents. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS finalize an interagency approach to post-core management of ACE that includes (1) processes for prioritizing enhancements to ACE and for sharing ACE operations and maintenance and development costs, including the costs of suggested enhancements among partner agencies that may benefit, and (2) time frames for implementing such processes. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-169": "Why GAO Did This Study The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires marketplaces to verify applicant information to determine eligibility for enrollment and income-based subsidies, if applicable. GAO was asked to review the FFM's enrollment and eligibility-verification process. This report examines the extent to which (1) indications of potentially improper or fraudulent enrollments exist in the FFM's application, enrollment, and eligibility-verification process for the 2015 enrollment period; and (2) reportedly deceased individuals received coverage with an associated subsidy during plan year 2015. GAO analyzed enrollment and eligibility data for applicants enrolled from November 15, 2014, through December 31, 2015, and identified about 8.04 million applicants with an associated subsidy who effectuated enrollments in plan year 2015. GAO also reviewed relevant federal statutes, HHS regulations, and CMS policies for plan year 2015. GAO also interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of plan year 2015 enrollment and eligibility data identified a small percentage\u2014about 1 percent\u2014of enrollments that were potentially improper or fraudulent because they had an unresolved issue related to citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence, or to Social Security number (SSN), or were reportedly deceased. The presence of an unresolved data-matching inconsistency could indicate that an enrollment is potentially improper or fraudulent because the FFM could not verify information provided by the applicant. When a data-matching inconsistency is generated, HHS regulations require that the applicant provide supporting documentation generally within 90 days to resolve the inconsistency. If the applicant does not provide requested documentation within the time frame and the FFM cannot otherwise verify the information provided by the applicant, the inconsistency may be expired, which could lead to termination from coverage or a recalculation or elimination of subsidy amounts based on the trusted data source information, depending on the type of inconsistency. GAO's analysis of plan year 2015 FFM enrollment and eligibility data identified a small percentage\u2014about 1 percent\u2014of enrollments that were potentially improper or fraudulent because they had an unresolved issue related to citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence, or to SSN, or were reportedly deceased. The FFM flags applicants as having an inconsistency if they attested to being a citizen but their status as a citizen could not be verified\u2014for example, because their SSN and other information does not match the Social Security Administration's (SSA) records. The FFM identified the remaining approximately 961,000 applicants (12 percent), as having inconsistencies related to citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence. The FFM was able to obtain information from the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program to address some inconsistencies related to citizenship, status as a national, or lawful presence, but issues with applicant-provided information precluded the FFM from querying all of the inconsistencies. GAO's analysis of a nongeneralizable sample of 15 applicants of the 139,000 applicants who received coverage with an associated subsidy in plan year 2015 whose information did not match SSA records identified SSN inconsistencies for most of the applicants whose information did not match SSA records. GAO found that the FFM identified SSN inconsistencies for most of the applicants whose information did not match SSA records. GAO found that the FFM resolved SSN inconsistencies in plan year 2015 primarily because the FFM could not update SSNs in the data system at the time. GAO found that the FFM did not resolve SSN inconsistencies in plan year 2015 primarily because the FFM could not update SSNs in the data system at the time. GAO found that the FFM resolved SSN inconsistencies in plan year 2015 primarily because the FFM could not update SSNs in the data system at the time.

    "gao_GAO-18-595": "Why GAO Did This Study GSA spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year on needed repairs to more than 1,600 federally owned buildings. GSA's R&A program provides repairs and alterations for buildings to ensure that they will protect both the government's investment and the health and safety of buildings' occupants, support the transfer of federal agencies from leased space, and be cost-effective. GSA's central office oversees the design and construction phases of the projects, from the procurement of design through the management of construction until project closeout. GAO was asked to review how GSA (1) collects information on R&A projects and (2) assesses the performance of R&A projects. This report examines (1) how GSA collects information on capital and small R&A projects and (2) how GSA assesses the performance of R&A projects. GAO reviewed documentation related to the R&A program and interviewed officials from GSA's central office and four regional offices. GAO also interviewed officials from GSA's central office and four regional offices. What GAO Found The General Services Administration (GSA) collects information on repair and alteration (R&A) projects electronically and is taking steps to improve the collection of small project information. GSA uses its Electronic Project Management (ePM/ePMXpress) system to collect information electronically on capital and small projects. GSA's central office first introduced ePM as a pilot project in 2009 and, to establish consistency in the information collected, issued minimum requirement guidelines for the project information to be input in the system in 2011. These guidelines require project team members to enter specific information on both capital and small projects into ePM. GSA's central office has seen improvements in the collection of capital R&A project information since first requiring regional offices to use ePM. GSA officials said that project team members are now consistently creating capital R&A projects in ePM and regularly updating information on these projects in a complete and timely manner, throughout the agency's project design and construction delivery process. GSA officials said that the rate at which project team members initially create all of their small R&A projects in ePMXpress has also improved in recent years. GSA officials said that the agency is continuing to emphasize the importance of having complete and timely information on all small R&A projects in ePMXpress to its regional offices. GSA uses schedule- and budget-related performance measures to assess the performance of capital and small R&A projects. GSA's central office assesses the performance of capital and small R&A projects across its regional offices by focusing primarily on schedule and budget-related measures. According to internal GSA guidelines on performance measures, measuring projects' schedule and budget performance allows GSA to continuously improve the project delivery and accountability of its work in order to demonstrate good stewardship of its stakeholders' limited funding. GSA's central office produces regional and national reports and provides them to their regional offices to facilitate internal discussion on R&A projects' performance. Specifically, GSA shares the reports containing regional and overall results of its timely award measure, project delivery measures, and the previously discussed reconciliation measure to encourage conversations among senior GSA leadership and regional management. GSA also shares R&A project delivery measure results with the Office of Management and Budget when compiling its annual performance reports. Regional officials varied in the extent to which they viewed R&A performance reports as useful, and some regions have developed their own approaches to understanding projects' performance. For example, officials from all four GSA regions GAO contacted said that some reports distributed by the central office are not specific to their information needs. Officials from another region said they do not find a particular report to be useful because\u2014in addition to the timely award measure that GSA emphasizes in working to understand R&A project performance\u2014it also includes less prominent milestones in identifying whether a project is on schedule. Officials from GSA's central office said they are aware that some regions have not found R&A performance reports to be useful. GSA has been conducting outreach to its regional offices to better understand what information regions find useful to understanding their projects' performance. GSA's plan for this outreach states that one of its aims is to ensure that regions clearly understand the purpose, outcome, and value of new reports being developed. As outreach to regions continues, GSA has begun to introduce what officials describe as \"self-service dashboard\" reports to present a consolidated view of R&A project information, with the intent of promoting a consistent understanding of performance across the agency. Even with these dashboards, GSA officials acknowledge that some regional offices may also continue to rely on other sources of information but added that the near real-time nature and ability to filter information offered by the dashboard",

The United States also provides funding to the PAHO, IICA, and IICA through assistance agreements. GAO was asked to review the extent to which the United States has monitored the implementation of these agreements. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which the United States has assessed the contributions to these organizations and (2) the extent to which the United States has provided voluntary contributions to these organizations. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report, which examined the extent to which the United States assessed the contributions to these organizations. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed U.S. agency officials. GAO also reviewed 12 selected assistance agreements from State, HHS, USAID, and USDA (out of a total of 60 active agreements during calendar years 2014 through 2016). What GAO Found In June 2017, GAO reported that the United States assessed over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter-American organizations from 2014 through 2016. During this time, the annual U.S. percentages (or quotas) of these organizations' assessed contributions have remained about the same. Therefore, the actual amounts assessed to the United States generally remained the same. The United States provided voluntary contributions to the OAS, PAHO, and IICA through assistance agreements. In GAO's December 2017 report, GAO found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has taken corrective action since the grants were awarded. GAO also found that all four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed. State and HHS both initiated corrective action prior to GAO's review of the grants. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement. In its December 2017 report, GAO recommended that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of its agreements and USAID and USDA ensure full documentation of monitoring activities. The agencies concurred with these recommendations and indicated that they will take actions to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-327": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies and labs license inventions developed in federal laboratories for commercial use or other practical applications. Agencies and labs use a variety of methods to attract potential licensees, including public outreach, conferences, and partnerships. GAO was asked to review federal labs' patent licensing activities. This report examines (1) challenges federal labs and stakeholders have faced in patent licensing and steps agencies and labs have taken to address them, and (2) the extent to which federal labs have information on financial terms in patent licenses. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed agency and lab officials and external stakeholders. GAO also interviewed agency and lab officials and lab officials at the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). What GAO Found Federal labs and stakeholders have identified challenges in patent licensing, and agencies have taken some steps to address them, but the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has not fully reported such challenges. Specifically, DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH officials at the agency and lab levels, as well as external stakeholders, identified challenges related to all seven areas of the patent licensing process, including identifying inventions, keeping track of inventions, and negotiating license agreements. In addition, officials and stakeholders cited challenges in one area that cuts across the entire process: prioritizing patent licensing as part of agencies' missions. In its annual reports to Congress on federal labs' performance in patent licensing activities, NIST has discussed some challenges identified by agency and lab officials and external stakeholders but has not fully reported on the range of challenges they have experienced. For example, in its fiscal year 2015 summary report\u2014its most recent report\u2014on federal technology transfer, NIST reported that the federal intramural research budget has been relatively consistent over the years but not that DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH face challenges in prioritizing patent licensing as an agency mission. NIST officials stated that they were generally aware of the challenges identified by agency and lab officials and external stakeholders but had not considered including such challenges to a greater degree in the summary reports to Congress. By fully reporting the range of challenges in federal patent licensing\u2014such as those outlined in this report\u2014and including that information in its annual summary reports to Congress, NIST has the opportunity to further ensure that Congress is more aware of challenges that limit agencies' efforts in patent licensing and ways for potentially addressing those challenges. Federal agencies and labs have limited information on financial terms in patent licenses. DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH labs generally do not document their processes for establishing the financial terms of patent licenses and instead rely on the expertise of technology transfer staff. Furthermore, existing agency and lab guidance does not consistently link the practice of establishing license financial terms to the statutory goal of promoting commercial use of inventions. In addition, although many federal labs rely on comparable licenses to aid them in setting the terms of new licenses, labs have varying levels of access to information about such licenses. By facilitating the formal sharing of comparable license information, NIST could help provide agencies and labs with benchmarks for evaluating which financial terms are best suited to licensing inventions successfully. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NIST fully report the range of challenges in federal patent licensing, including those outlined in this report, and include that information in its annual summary reports to Congress. NIST agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

The majority of illicit drugs consumed in the United States is produced in Mexico and South America and enters the United States across the southwest border or through the Caribbean. GAO was asked to review U.S. counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere. This report examines (1) U.S. agencies' spending for counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere in fiscal years 2010 through 2015, (2) agencies' efforts to gather and share best practices and lessons learned from their counternarcotics efforts both domestically and internationally, and (3) mechanisms that agencies have used to address changing drug threats. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also interviewed officials from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), ONDCP, State, and USAID.

These agencies obligated more than $2.8 billion for counternarcotics activities in the Western Hemisphere for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. DOD's counternarcotics activities support U.S. domestic and foreign government efforts to combat drug trafficking and drug-related terrorist activities through detection and monitoring of illicit drug smuggling, information and intelligence sharing, and capacity building. DOD also obligated a total of more than $1.5 billion for counternarcotics activities in the Western Hemisphere for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. The Department of Justice (DOJ) obligated almost $13 billion for domestic and international enforcement activities in fiscal years 2010 through 2015. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) obligated almost $13 billion for domestic and international enforcement activities in fiscal years 2010 through 2015. ONDCP facilitates the sharing of best practices and lessons learned from their counternarcotics efforts both domestically and internationally. For example, ONDCP officials described the sharing of best practices and lessons learned with stakeholders from Canada, Mexico, and the United States at technical workshops of the North American Drug Dialogue held in March 2017. Officials at 7 of the 10 agencies included in GAO's review reported having processes for identifying and collecting best practices and lessons learned from counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere. Officials at each of these seven agencies also reported having mechanisms to share best practices and lessons learned, including through web-enabled systems, and sharing these best practices and lessons learned with other U.S. agencies and foreign partners. In addition, officials at six of the seven agencies reported having a formal review process for determining best practices and lessons learned. ONDCP works with agencies to coordinate responses to changing counternarcotics conditions in a variety of ways. ONDCP is responsible for developing (1) the National Drug Control Strategy, which sets forth a comprehensive plan to reduce illicit drug use through programs intended to prevent or treat drug use or reduce the availability of illegal drugs; and (2) several associated companion strategies, which target government efforts to respond to emerging counternarcotics threats for key geographic areas. The Strategy issued in 2010 laid out the administration's 5-year blueprint for combatting drug use and included a section on counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere. The Strategy, including the portions associated with counternarcotics efforts in the Western Hemisphere, is updated annually to reflect current priorities and conditions. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, issued in 2012, parallels the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy and focuses on ongoing efforts to reduce transnational organized crime threats on both sides of the border between the United States and Canada, specifically the movement of illicit drugs such as marijuana, ecstasy, methamphetamine, and cocaine, and the proceeds from the sale of those drugs. The 2015 Strategy acknowledges the companion strategies and indicates that the efforts they describe will be carried out. The National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, issued in 2012, parallels the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy and focuses on ongoing efforts to reduce transnational organized crime threats on both sides of the border between the United States and Canada, specifically the movement of illicit drugs such as marijuana, ecstasy, methamphe",
    "gao_GAO-18-283": "Why GAO Did This Study ARNG disburses more than $1.8 billion in financial incentives to bolster its recruiting and retention efforts. In 2008, a California National Guard audit revealed that soldiers were improperly paid a number of incentive payments. In response, ARNG began using the Guard Incentive Management System to oversee its incentive contracts. GAO was asked to review ARNG's internal controls. This report examines (1) ARNG's internal controls to prevent improper incentive payments and (2) the authority of the Department of Defense (DOD) components to waive soldiers' incentive debts. GAO reviewed ARNG policies and procedures, interviewed ARNG officials, and conducted site visits to selected states. What GAO Found The Army National Guard (ARNG) has implemented internal controls to prevent improper incentive payments, but has not developed and implemented a plan for future significant changes that could affect its internal controls. ARNG has implemented internal controls, including automated and manual reviews, to prevent improper incentive payments, and it also reviews its incentive programs on a periodic basis. First, ARNG began using the Guard Incentive Management System to manage the life cycles of contracts between ARNG and soldiers for incentives and education entitlements, including those for the Selected Reserve Incentive Program. Second, ARNG conducts periodic reviews of its incentive program. ARNG took steps to address some identified weaknesses to its internal controls for managing soldier incentive contracts, but has not developed and implemented a plan for future significant changes that could affect its internal controls. For example, in October 2015, a previous contract to support the ARNG Incentive Support Team expired, and performance of the follow-on contract was delayed for approximately two years\u2014until September 2017\u2014by actions related to two GAO bid protests. ARNG officials told GAO that they increased their review of incentive contracts from 10 percent to 30 percent to help mitigate the loss of the 100 percent review that the ARNG Incentive Support Team had previously provided. ARNG also adjusted their review of soldier incentive contracts from 30 percent back to 10 percent. ARNG has also taken steps to address unforeseen technical issues that have affected its incentive program. For example, ARNG has implemented several recommendations that were made as part of the Army's administrative investigation of the transition in vendors managing the Reserve Component Manpower System, of which the Guard Incentive Management System is a component. ARNG officials told GAO that they have since assigned this expert and had implemented other recommendations from the investigation, but were not tracking progress on those recommendations. Without taking action to plan for potentially significant changes to its internal controls for the Reserve Component Manpower System, ARNG is at risk of not being prepared for these changes that could contribute to the potential for making improper payments. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) have the authority to waive erroneous incentive debts for ARNG soldiers. DFAS has the authority to waive established debts of $10,000 or less. DOHA, another DOD component, adjudicates waivers for debts of more than $10,000. DOHA officials told GAO that they will verify the correctness of the debt before adjudicating a waiver case and may request information from DFAS\u2014such as documentation\u2014including enlistment contracts, payment vouchers, and leave and earnings statements. Additionally, DOHA officials told GAO that they do not have the authority to adjudicate debts for payments made under the Student Loan Repayment Program\u2014one type of payment under the Selected Reserve Incentive Program\u2014because of their determination that their authority to waive debts for erroneously paid \u201cpay and allowances\u201d does not apply to payments to lenders for educational expenses. Those cases are reviewed and adjudicated at the discretion of the Secretary of the Army. If DOHA denies a soldier's waiver application, the soldier may request that DOHA reconsider its decision, which DOHA officials told GAO is accomplished by an appeals panel of three DOHA attorneys. The decision of this panel is final and ends the waiver of indebtedness adjudication process. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that ARNG develop and implement a plan to identify, analyze, and address any significant changes that could affect internal controls for its Guard Incentive Management System. ARNG concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-5": "Why GAO Did This Study DOE relies on M&O contractors to carry out its mission. M&O contractors are generally paid a fee based on the contractor's assessed performance. GAO was asked to review DOE's M&O contractor performance. This report examines (1) how DOE offices evaluated M&O contractor performance in fiscal years 2006 through 2016 and the extent to which these offices have documented their evaluation approaches; (2) the extent to which DOE's fiscal year 2016 M&O contractor performance evaluation reports provide information on contractors' technical, administrative, and cost performance; and (3) the results of DOE's M&O contractor performance evaluations from fiscal years 2006 through 2016. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed DOE officials. GAO also reviewed DOE's annual performance evaluation plans and PERs for fiscal years 2006 through 2016. What GAO Found The Department of Energy (DOE) offices generally used one of three different approaches to evaluate M&O contractor performance. All but one of these offices have documented their approaches in policies and procedures; the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has a broad policy but does not have procedures for implementing it, in particular for collecting and using performance information. In the absence of documented procedures, NNSA may not consistently collect and use performance information in evaluating contractor performance. GAO found that DOE offices' fiscal year 2016 performance evaluation reports (PER) provided less information on M&O contractors' cost performance\u2014evaluations of the contractor's spending, budgeting, strategic sourcing, and costs, including the contractor's cost-effectiveness\u2014and provided more information regarding technical and administrative areas of performance. Specifically, the PERs were 67 pages long on average and contained about 1 page of cost performance-related information overall. In contrast, information on contractors' technical and administrative performance included in-depth descriptions of contractors' scientific discoveries and production progress that spanned numerous pages. In addition, the cost information contained in DOE offices' fiscal year 2016 PERs is of limited use for acquisition decision-making. DOE offices have not required specific assessment of cost performance in their performance evaluation policies, nor discussed how to ensure that cost information is useful for acquisition decision-making. By updating their policies to require quality cost performance information in PERs to enable an overall assessment of M&O contractor cost performance, DOE offices could strengthen their oversight of M&O contractor costs. For fiscal years 2006 through 2016, GAO found the results of the evaluations to generally include high performance ratings and most available performance incentives, including a median of 94 percent of available award and incentive fees. During this time frame, administrative performance sometimes had lower ratings\u2014though these were balanced out in overall ratings by strong performance elsewhere\u2014and some safety issues and accidents resulted in additional fee reductions outside the performance evaluation process. In fiscal years 2006 through 2016, three contractors received 50 percent or less of available award fee due to two significant incidents\u2014a safety and security issue and a major accident. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOE update its policies to require that PERs include quality information on cost performance to enable an overall assessment of M&O contractor cost performance. DOE agreed with four of GAO's seven recommendations and partially agreed with the others.",
    "gao_GAO-18-638": "Why GAO Did This Study USPS has a high volume of competitive products that are a growing sector of its business. USPS uses scanning to track the movement of these products. GAO was asked to review USPS's scanning performance. This report examines (1) the extent to which USPS's competitive products are scanned and scanned correctly, (2) the extent to which USPS's policies and procedures for scanning competitive products are based on standards for internal controls, and (3) the extent to which USPS reports on scanning performance are used to investigate and resolve scanning issues. GAO reviewed USPS documents and interviewed USPS officials and representatives from five major mailers that use USPS's competitive products. GAO also interviewed USPS officials and representatives from the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the USPS Office of the Inspector General (OIG). What GAO Found The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) reports GAO reviewed indicate that competitive products are almost always scanned and scanned correctly. USPS has an overall organizational goal of accurately scanning 100 percent of all mail pieces\u2014both competitive and other products\u2014that have a barcode. However, individual management employee-performance goals for scanning are set slightly lower than 100 percent, as USPS officials stated that they recognize that some scanning issues, such as for missing or damaged barcodes, may occur across post offices. USPS reports GAO reviewed indicate that competitive products are almost always scanned and scanned correctly. USPS officials stated that they have not used any specific criteria for designing, implementing, and operating an internal control system for meeting its operational policies and internal controls, such as those that help ensure competitive products are accurately scanned. USPS officials stated that USPS has designed its operational policies and internal controls over the years based on its unique responsibilities, management experience, and sound business practices. However, officials could not identify any specific standards or framework they had followed. GAO has reported that standards for the design, implementation, and operation of an internal-control system provide an overall framework for establishing and maintaining an effective internal-control system\u2014which is a key factor in achieving an entity's mission. Without standards for an effective internal-control system for its operational policies and procedures for scanning competitive products, USPS may miss opportunities to improve how it achieves its mission to deliver those important products. USPS has standard operating procedures for scanning competitive products, but they may not guarantee accurate scanning because they are not consistent. For example, USPS's City Carrier Handbook states that mail with a barcode should be scanned at the delivery point (or address). However, a standard operating procedure document for city carriers at a post office GAO visited stated that carriers must scan each delivery confirmation mail piece but did not specify that this scan had to be at the delivery point or address. Locally developed procedures may not be uncommon, as one district manager told GAO that USPS headquarters allows managers to make a certain amount of flexibility to adapt the standard operating procedures for each post office. USPS reports GAO reviewed indicate that managers use a variety of reports to monitor scanning performance of carriers and clerks at each post office and to identify the causes of scanning issues, such as missing or inaccurate scans. However, these reports may not be used consistently by managers to resolve scanning issues. For example, one district official sends postmasters weekly reports on competitive products that do not have all the required scans, while another post office manager told GAO that this report was not available to them. Without detailed procedures to guide managers in finding and using specific information in available reports and other tools, managers will not have consistent information to use to investigate and resolve customer complaints quickly or accurately. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that USPS identify and adopt a set of internal control standards for its operational internal-control activities, such as those for scanning competitive products. USPS agreed with the recommendations and committed to completing corrective actions by November 2018.",
    "gao_GAO-18-319": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a long-standing interest in reducing space and using space more efficiently. GAO was asked to review the use of telework in space planning. This report addresses: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO analyzed agency-wide space-planning policies and procedures, and Real Property Efficiency Plans; surveyed the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies; and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported using telework to reduce or use space more efficiently. Specifically, GAO's analysis of (1) agency-wide space-planning policies and procedures and (2) Real Property Efficiency Plans found that all of the agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies. Agencies also provided examples in survey responses of how they have used telework to increase operational effectiveness while optimizing their use of space. GAO's analysis of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies found that the use of telework in office space planning varied from emerging consideration to extensive implementation. For example, the General Services Administration (GSA) used telework extensively to reduce space by implementing unassigned workstations in nearly all of its regional and headquarters offices, along with other forms of \"employee mobility,\" complementary information technology (IT), and smaller space standards. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used telework to reduce space or use space more efficiently in more limited cases while the Fiscal Service has begun to consider telework in future space planning. GAO's analysis of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies identified three major planning challenges agencies face with using telework to reduce space: human capital issues such as negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change; the suitability of telework to mission work requirements; and difficulty measuring cost savings that might result from space reductions attributable to telework. This measuring difficulty may include both gross savings as well as savings net of costs, such as for renovations or IT investments. About half (12 of 23) of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported that office space reductions resulting from using telework in space planning led to real estate cost savings while the other half reported either that cost savings did not result or they did not know. GSA officials told GAO that calculating cost savings attributable to a particular aspect of space planning is complicated as several factors contribute to savings. In response to GAO's survey, nearly two-thirds of the agencies reported that they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources to assist them in using telework as a space-planning tool. Until agencies have access to detailed guidance and tools to help utilize various space-planning options, they may not be able to effectively identify opportunities to use telework toward the goal of reducing their real property footprint. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Administrator of General Services ensure that the appropriate GSA offices develop guidance including, but not limited to, how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool for reducing and optimizing office space efficiency and that the offices make the guidance readily available. GSA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-401": "Why GAO Did This Study The FMS program provides support to over 150 foreign partners, with sales totaling $416 billion between fiscal years 2007 and 2017. The balance of the FMS administrative account grew from $391 million to $4.1 billion, or 953 percent. The balance of the CAS account grew from $1.1 billion to $3.6 billion, or 953 percent. GAO was asked to review the FMS administrative account balance. This report examines (1) the balance maintained in the administrative account in fiscal years 2007 to 2017, the controls used to manage it, and the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD) has the ability to pay for FMS administrative expenses under different scenarios; and (2) the balance maintained in the contract administration services (CAS) account in fiscal years 2007 to 2017 and the controls used to manage it. GAO analyzed data on the balance and related trends over the period, reviewed relevant laws and DOD guidance, and interviewed DOD and State officials. What GAO Found The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) administrative account balance grew steadily over the last decade due in part to the insufficient controls the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has in place to manage the account balance. Although DSCA has set a minimum desired level for the account and a process for regular monitoring, it has not completed timely comprehensive reviews of the administrative fee rate. In addition, DSCA has not adopted the best practice of establishing a method to calculate an upper bound of a target range for the account balance. As a result, DSCA cannot provide adequate assurance that the account maintains an appropriate balance that is both sufficient but not excessive. GAO's analysis indicates that even if the administrative fee rate were reduced to as low as 2.9 percent and annual expenditures were to increase 15 percent above expected growth, the administrative account balance would likely remain sufficient to pay for projected expenditures while maintaining a reserve balance through at least fiscal year 2024. The CAS account balance grew substantially between fiscal years 2007 and 2015 because CAS collections exceeded expenditures in each year and insufficient controls were in place to manage the balance. The account balances for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 overstate available CAS funds due to a systems issue and limited related oversight. Since 2014, DSCA has created some controls to help better manage this account; however, DSCA does not plan to conduct timely comprehensive reviews of the CAS fee rate, has inconsistently implemented internal guidance related to calculating the minimum desired level for the account, and has not established a method to calculate an upper bound of a target range for the account balance. As a result, DSCA cannot provide adequate assurance that the account maintains an appropriate balance that is both sufficient but not excessive. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DSCA (1) take steps to ensure that comprehensive reviews of the administrative fee rate are completed at least every 5 years, (2) define a method for calculating an upper bound of a target range for the account balance, and (3) take steps to ensure that timely comprehensive reviews of the CAS fee rate are completed at least every 5 years. DSCA concurred with five of GAO's recommendations and partially concurred with one.",
    "gao_GAO-18-388": "Why GAO Did This Study The LDA requires lobbyists to file quarterly disclosure reports and semiannual reports on certain political contributions. The LDA also requires GAO to review lobbyists' compliance with the LDA. This report examines (1) the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the LDA by providing documentation to support information contained on registrations and reports filed under the LDA; (2) challenges and potential improvements to compliance, if any; and (3) the resources and authorities available to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO), its role in enforcing LDA compliance, and the efforts it has made to improve LDA enforcement. GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 98 disclosure reports filed from the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first and second quarters of 2017. GAO also reviewed a stratified random sample of LD-203 reports from the year-end 2016 and midyear 2017 filing periods. GAO also interviewed USAO officials. What GAO Found GAO found that most lobbyists filed required quarterly disclosure reports (LD-2) for most new lobbying registrations filed from 2010 through 2017. For most LD-2 reports, lobbyists provided documentation for key elements, including documentation for their income and expenses. However, in recent years GAO's findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of lobbyists who have reports with documentation for income and expenses supporting lobbying activities. Specifically, GAO estimates that 25 percent of LD-2 reports did not round their income or expenses as the guidance requires. GAO has found that rounding difficulties have been a recurring issue on LD-2 reports from 2010 through 2017. GAO estimates that 93 percent of LD-2 reports filed year-end 2016 for all lobbyists listed political contributions on the report as required. GAO estimates that 15 percent of all LD-2 reports may not have properly disclosed previously held covered positions in the executive or legislative branch, such as high ranking agency officials and congressional staff, as required. As in GAO's other reports, some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions, such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. GAO estimates that overall for 2017, lobbyists failed to disclose one or more reportable contributions on 12 percent of reports. Additionally, ten LD-203 reports were amended in response to GAO's review. For this element in prior reports, GAO reported an estimated minimum percentage of reports based on a one-sided 95 percent confidence interval rather than the estimated proportion. GAO estimates that overall for 2017, lobbyists failed to disclose one or more reportable contributions on 12 percent of reports.

GAO estimates that overall for 2017, lobbyists failed to disclose one or more reportable contributions on 12 percent of reports. GAO also found that most lobbyists rated the definitions of terms used in LD-2 reporting as \u201cvery easy\u201d or \u201csomewhat easy\u201d to understand with regard to meeting their reporting requirements. USAO officials stated that they continue to have sufficient personnel resources and authority under the LDA to enforce reporting requirements. This includes imposing civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. USAO received 3,213 referrals from both the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House for failure to comply with LD-2 reporting requirements cumulatively for filing years 2009 through 2015. About 45 percent (1,450 of 3,213) of the total referrals received are now compliant because lobbying firms either filed their reports or terminated their registrations. In addition, some of the referrals were found to be compliant when USAO received the referral. Therefore, no action was taken. About 55 percent (1,752 of 3,213) of the referrals are pending further action because USAO could not locate the lobbyist, did not receive a response from the lobbyist after an enforcement action, or plans to conduct additional research to determine if it can locate the lobbyist. The remaining 11 referrals did not require action or were suspended because the lobbyist or client was no longer in business or the lobbyist was deceased.

    "gao_GAO-18-302": "Why GAO Did This Study The Medicare and Medicaid Improvement and Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 583) established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) to test and expand models that are designed to improve Medicare spending and quality of care. The act also established a provision for GAO to review the Innovation Center. This report examines (1) the number of models implemented and announced by the Innovation Center, (2) the extent to which the Innovation Center obligated over $5.6 billion of its $10 billion appropriated for fiscal years 2011 through 2019, and (3) the extent to which the Innovation Center used the results from evaluations to inform the development of additional models and to make changes to implemented models. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from the Innovation Center and CMS. GAO also reviewed the Innovation Center's performance measures and results. What GAO Found The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) implemented 37 models that tested delivery and payment approaches tested and program beneficiaries covered. Of those 37 models, the testing period has concluded for 10 of them. In addition, the Innovation Center has announced two models to begin testing in 2018. The Innovation Center obligated over $5.6 billion of its $10 billion appropriated for fiscal years 2011 through 2019 under section 1115A of the Social Security Act. The obligated amounts for individual models during this period ranged from $8.4 million to over $967 million, and varied based on model scope and design. The Innovation Center has used the results from model evaluations to inform the development of additional models and to make changes to implemented models. For some of the early implemented models, evaluation results showed reduced spending and maintained or improved quality of care, but also identified model design limitations that could affect those results. According to officials, in some of these instances, the Innovation Center has developed new models that build upon the approaches of earlier models, but include adjustments intended to address identified limitations. The Innovation Center has established three center-wide performance goals and related performance measures. Goal 1: Reduce the growth of healthcare costs while promoting better health and health care quality through delivery system reform. This goal has three performance measures that focus on accountable care organizations (ACOs). The Innovation Center reported mixed results in achieving the targets set. According to agency reported data, the Innovation Center met the targets for 2 of its 3 Goal 1 performance measures for 2015. For the remaining measure\u2014the percentage of ACOs that shared in savings\u2014the center did not meet its target during either of the two years for which data were available. According to officials, when results fall short of targets, they examine the causes and make appropriate adjustments to the program.

    "gao_GAO-18-344": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS is responsible for acquiring and delivering systems to close critical capability gaps and enable DHS to execute its mission. DHS uses O&S funds to support its operations and support activities. GAO was asked to review DHS's operations and maintenance activities. This report assesses, for selected major acquisition programs, the extent that (1) DHS budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight; and (2) life-cycle cost estimates are comprehensive and accurate, as well as regularly updated. GAO reviewed DHS budget justifications and program-level O&S data, and interviewed DHS officials. GAO also reviewed life-cycle cost estimates for 11 selected programs. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) mission-oriented budget management provides operational flexibility in using Operations and Support (O&S) funds. However, DHS's budget justifications and reports aggregate programs' O&S data, limiting oversight of major acquisition programs' O&S costs. While some program-level O&S data are available at the component level, this information does not appear in DHS's budget reports to Congress. This disparity is due, in part, to the format of the budget reports. DHS's recent change to its congressional budget justification to include program-level O&S cost information in the procurement section of the congressional budget justification is an improvement, but still does not address this shortfall for all programs. DHS's recent proposal to shift back to reporting program-level O&S funding in the Future Years Homeland Security Program report demonstrates that the department sees value in providing such information to Congress and that such information is available to some extent. Until DHS takes concrete action to reverse the exclusion of O&S funding at a major acquisition program level in its Future Years Homeland Security Program reports, Congress will lack important information necessary for oversight. The life-cycle cost estimates for all but one selected program were comprehensive but many did not provide evidence of accuracy. Specifically, 10 of the 11 selected programs reviewed either substantially or fully met GAO's best practices criteria for comprehensiveness, while only 5 substantially or fully met criteria for accuracy. These programs have met DHS's acquisition policy that major acquisition programs generally revise their LCCEs at major acquisition decision events and generally met DHS's 2016 requirement for annual updates. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS work with Congress to add information to its annual congressional budget justification to show O&S funding requests for major acquisition programs within current program/project activity accounts. DHS concurred with all three recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-160": "Why GAO Did This Study Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) are the territories with the highest debt burdens. GAO was asked to review the territories' ability to repay public debt. This report describes (1) trends in public debt and its composition between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, (2) trends in revenue and its composition between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, (3) the major reported drivers of the territory's public debt, and (4) what is known about the ability of the territory to repay public debt. GAO analyzed data from the territories' single audit reports, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed officials from the territories' governments, rating agencies, and publically available reports. What GAO Found Puerto Rico's total public debt increased from $39.2 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $67.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014\u2014an average rate of 6.3 percent per year. Bonded debt outstanding accounted for $24.3 billion of the $37.9 billion in total bonded debt. Puerto Rico's primary government and the three largest component units\u2014the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewage Authority, and the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority\u2014owed the majority of Puerto Rico's public debt outstanding in fiscal year 2014. The primary government's share of total public debt outstanding grew relative to debt owed by all of the component units from 44 percent in fiscal year 2005 to 59 percent in fiscal year 2014. Puerto Rico's total revenue (i.e. general revenue and program revenue combined) grew from $25.5 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $32.5 billion in fiscal year 2014. Puerto Rico's net position for the primary government declined year over year from a negative $15.2 billion as of fiscal year end 2005 to a negative $49.7 billion as of fiscal year end 2014. Despite the growth in revenue, Puerto Rico's net position for the primary government declined year over year from a positive $2.5 billion as of fiscal year end 2005 to a negative $43.6 billion as of fiscal year end 2014. The results of Puerto Rico's restructuring process will determine the outlook for repayment of debt. American Samoa's total public debt more than doubled and it grew from 5 to 11 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) between fiscal years 2005 and 2015. Until fiscal year 2015, the portion of American Samoa's total public debt outstanding that was bonded debt outstanding was limited. Between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, American Samoa's total public debt outstanding as a percentage of GDP was 5.3 percent, reached a low of 4.4 percent in fiscal year 2014, and grew to 10.9 percent in fiscal year 2015. During this same period, bonded debt outstanding as a share of GDP was 1.3 percent in fiscal year 2005, declined to 0.44 percent in fiscal year 2007 and remained at 0 percent between fiscal years 2008 and 2014. The new bond issuance in fiscal year 2015 increased the share to 8.6 percent. American Samoa's total revenue (i.e. general revenue and program revenue combined) also fluctuated but trended upward between fiscal years 2005 and 2015.

    "gao_GAO-18-320": "Why GAO Did This Study Patents are the primary means by which patents can be used to protect innovation and promote economic growth. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in Alice that business method patents were not patentable, limiting the patentability of some business method patents. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Alice that the CBM program was not patentable. GAO was asked to review the CBM program. This report (1) describes the extent to which the CBM program has been used to challenge patents, and the results of those challenges; (2) examines the extent to which USPTO ensures timeliness of trial decisions, reviews decisions for consistency, and engages with stakeholders to improve its administrative proceedings for the program; and (3) discusses stakeholder views on the effects of the CBM program and whether it should be extended past its scheduled September 2020 sunset date. GAO analyzed USPTO data on patents challenged under the CBM program from September 2012 through September 2017, reviewed relevant USPTO documents, and interviewed USPTO officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found From September 2012 through September 2017, parties accused of patent infringement filed 524 petitions challenging the validity of 359 distinct patents under the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (CBM) program, resulting in rulings against about one-third of these patents. The average monthly number of CBM petitions fluctuated during this period, but use of the program has declined since about 2015. Some stakeholders have expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent, but GAO's analysis of petition data showed that the vast majority of patents challenged under the CBM program were challenged once or twice. Overall, through September 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board completed reviews of 329 of the 359 patents challenged under the program, and the board ruled at least some challenged patent claims unpatentable in about one-third of these patents. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has completed all trials under AIA-authorized proceedings within statutorily directed time frames, according to board data, and the board has taken steps to review issues that could affect the consistency of its trial proceedings and decisions and to engage with stakeholders to improve its proceedings. However, the board does not have guidance, such as documented procedures, for reviewing trial decisions and the processes that lead to the decisions. Without developing guidance, such as documented procedures, outlining the steps USPTO will take to review the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decisions and the processes that lead to decisions, USPTO cannot fully ensure that it is meeting the objective of ensuring consistency of its decisions. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally agreed that the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents, and many said there is value in maintaining some aspects of the program. Stakeholders generally agreed that the CBM program has contributed to a decrease in litigation involving business method patents and that the program has had positive effects on innovation and investment. Stakeholders also said there is value in maintaining, among other things, the ability to challenge patents on all four statutory grounds before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Stakeholders generally agreed that the ability to challenge a patent's validity on subject matter eligibility grounds remains important, although there was no broad agreement among stakeholders regarding how far that ability should extend beyond business method patents. Stakeholders also said there is value in maintaining, among other things, the ability to challenge patents on subject matter eligibility grounds. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Director of USPTO develop guidance, such as documented procedures, for judges reviewing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's decisions and the processes that lead to the decisions. The department agreed with the recommendation and stated that it has begun taking steps to address it, including drafting a formal, written charter that documents procedures for reviewing board decisions.",
    "gao_GAO-18-218": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has a long-term interest in privatized housing, which includes housing for servicemembers and their families. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to assess the solvency of each privatized military housing project in the United States and the effect of recent changes in basic allowance for housing on long-term project sustainability. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) assessed and reported the financial condition of each privatized housing project; (2) assessed the effects of recent reductions in the basic allowance for housing on privatized housing, and identified any other challenges and options to address challenges; and (3) defined notification requirements for project changes and risk tolerances relative to privatized housing goals. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and financial reports, and interviewed DOD and military department officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) regularly assesses the financial condition of its privatized housing projects through recurring internal reporting by the military departments on each of their projects; however, key data on current financial conditions are not mutually comparable. Moreover, the military departments vary in the extent to which they use measures of future sustainment needs and funding to assess project sustainability. In addition, DOD has not consistently issued required reports to Congress on the financial condition of privatized housing projects in a timely manner. The military departments have completed some analysis of the projected effects of recent reductions in the basic allowance for housing on their privatized housing portfolios, but it has not fully assessed the significance of the effects on the future sustainment of each of their privatized housing projects. Specifically, the military departments have not fully assessed the significance of the effects on the future sustainment of each of their privatized housing projects. Moreover, DOD has not identified a course of action to address possible shortfalls resulting from the reductions in the basic allowance for housing. The military departments have identified options to address potential financial challenges to their privatized housing projects, including actions to increase revenue, actions to reduce expenses, and extraordinary measures to improve project financial conditions. For example, developers and military departments cited several options for increasing revenue, actions to reduce expenses, and extraordinary measures to improve project financial conditions. However, there are limitations, such as the potential to reduce tenant satisfaction and therefore occupancy levels, or costs to the government. The military departments have varied understandings of what changes to privatized housing projects require notification to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD (EI&E)). ASD (EI&E) has draft guidance on oversight and management of privatized military housing, which would define the circumstances under which military departments should notify ASD (EI&E) of project changes, but officials stated that they have not established a time frame for issuing this policy. Without issuing guidance to clearly define and communicate to the military departments the conditions that require notification, the military departments will not be able to consistently fulfill their responsibilities and ASD (EI&E) will not be able to completely fulfill its oversight function. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) provide additional contextual information in future reports to Congress on the financial condition of privatized military housing projects, (2) assess the effects of recent reductions in the basic allowance for housing on privatized housing, and (3) define notification requirements for project changes and risk tolerances relative to privatized housing goals.

This report examines the extent to which certain federal agencies' improper payment risk assessments for selected programs provided a reasonable basis for determining susceptibility to significant improper payments. GAO reviewed the extent to which (1) certain federal agencies' improper payment risk assessments for selected programs provided a reasonable basis for determining susceptibility to significant improper payments, and (2) the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Treasury, and Justice (DOJ) assessed the appropriate risk factors for improper payments. GAO reviewed relevant guidance and internal control standards, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Four of the five federal agencies' improper payment risk assessments for selected programs provided a reasonable basis for determining susceptibility to significant improper payments. HHS's improper payment risk assessment for Head Start lacked documentation to support its low risk determination. HHS's qualitative risk assessment for Head Start did not document or effectively demonstrate how each specific risk factor affected Head Start's susceptibility to significant improper payments. For example, HHS did not consider the Head Start eligibility decisions that these organizations made at the subrecipient level\u2014calling into question the reliability of HHS's risk assessment. HHS's qualitative risk assessment for Head Start also did not document or effectively demonstrate how the total score for all risk factors led to a determination that the program was not susceptible to significant improper payments. For example, HHS assigned a high-risk rating for three of the nine risk factors: (1) permanency of the program, (2) volume of payments made through the program, and (3) complexity per transaction. HHS's risk assessment template included the nine risk factors, among other factors, and described how the divisions should consider each risk factor. However, HHS did not document how the descriptors or individual risk factors relate to the program's susceptibility to significant improper payments. Further, although HHS used a risk assessment template to assess each of the risk factors, the division responsible for the Head Start program did not always provide sufficient documentation or support for GAO to determine how it arrived at its risk determinations for each risk factor. Without supporting documentation, HHS cannot demonstrate, and GAO cannot determine, if Head Start's low risk determination for Head Start was reasonable. HHS did not assess many of its programs and activities at least once during the 3-year period from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as amended (IPIA). Although HHS conducted improper payment risk assessments for a total of 71 programs and activities during the 3-year period, HHS did not conduct the required risk assessment for at least 140 programs. Treasury's risk assessment template for Interest on the Public Debt and the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) lacked documentation to support its low risk determinations.

    "gao_GAO-18-411": "Why GAO Did This Study BLM manages approximately 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate throughout the country, including the acreage it leases to operators for oil and gas development. BLM uses a multistep process to determine whether to suspend oil and gas leases. GAO was asked to review BLM's monitoring of lease suspensions. This report examines (1) the process BLM uses to determine whether to suspend oil and gas leases; (2) the extent of oil and gas lease suspensions and the reasons for the suspensions of selected leases; and (3) the approach that BLM uses to monitor the status of lease suspensions and the extent to which this approach allows for oversight of such lease suspensions. GAO analyzed BLM data on oil and gas lease suspensions as of September 30, 2016, and interviewed BLM officials. GAO also reviewed BLM's official lease files and a nongeneralizable sample of 48 leases in Montana and Wyoming that were suspended as of September 30, 2016. What GAO Found The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) uses a multistep process to determine whether to suspend oil and gas leases, and this process typically begins with an operator submitting a request to the appropriate BLM field office. Once the request is received, the cognizant BLM field official\u2014usually a petroleum engineer at the field office\u2014reviews it for completeness and whether the reasons cited meet the suspension criteria established in federal regulations and BLM's Suspensions of Operations and/or Production Manual. These criteria require that lease suspensions be approved only in the interest of the conservation of natural resources or for circumstances beyond the operator's control. BLM officials said that BLM field offices are primarily responsible for monitoring the status of lease suspensions they issue to ensure that the conditions for granting the suspension still exist. LR2000 did not always contain the reasons for suspensions, which required GAO to take additional steps to identify the reasons. BLM officials said that while LR2000 does not have a field to specifically capture the reason for a suspension, and inclusion of this information is not mandatory, the general remarks field could be used for this purpose. Because GAO found this remarks field was rarely used to capture the reason for suspensions, GAO reviewed the official lease files for a sample of 48 leases in Montana and Wyoming that were suspended as of September 30, 2016, and GAO interviewed field office staff for clarification. The reasons for the suspensions generally fell into four broad categories: environmental reviews, delays in reviewing applications for permits to drill, logistical conflicts, and other reasons.

The reasons for the suspensions generally fell into four broad categories: environmental reviews, delays in reviewing applications for permits to drill, logistical conflicts, and other reasons. BLM uses an informal approach to monitor lease suspensions and does not have procedures in place for monitoring suspensions, which may not ensure consistent and effective oversight. GAO found that BLM's field offices vary in how they monitor lease suspensions, and BLM does not have official agency procedures in place for monitoring, relying instead on an informal approach. GAO found that BLM's state offices do not always maintain current information on lease suspensions in the official lease files or LR2000, and BLM headquarters and state officials told GAO they generally do not oversee the monitoring of lease suspensions. By developing procedures for monitoring lease suspensions, including when to conduct monitoring efforts, BLM could promote more consistent monitoring to better ensure that lease suspensions in effect are warranted. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that BLM include a data field in the update or replacement for LR2000 to record the reasons for lease suspensions, develop procedures for monitoring lease suspensions, and develop mechanisms for monitoring lease suspensions.

    "gao_GAO-19-62": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2014, the number of UAC apprehended at the U.S.-Mexican border rose from nearly 28,000 in fiscal year 2012 to more than 42,000 in fiscal year 2013, and to more than 73,000 in fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2017, the number of UAC apprehended at the U.S.-Mexican border decreased from nearly 75,000 to 75,000. In addition, the number of UAC removed from the United States and returned to their home countries decreased. GAO was asked to review U.S. assistance for returning migrants. This report examines (1) USAID's efforts to assist the reception and reintegration of returning migrants into their home countries since fiscal year 2014; and (2) what is known about the effectiveness of these efforts. GAO reviewed USAID's three program contribution agreements with IOM, reviewed IOM's migration data, and interviewed U.S. and host government officials in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. What GAO Found The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided funding for short- and long-term assistance to migrants returning to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, including assisting returning migrants upon arrival at points of entry and reintegrating them into their home countries. USAID provided approximately $27 million to IOM through three program contribution agreements to conduct these efforts. These efforts are in various stages of development in all three countries. Host governments face challenges in their efforts to reintegrate migrants, including limited resources and a lack of employment opportunities. USAID assessed the effectiveness of its reception and migrant-related data collection efforts through site visits, meetings with IOM, and report reviews. This assistance has improved the capacity of the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to provide reception services to returning migrants and to collect and utilize migration information. USAID has not yet assessed the effectiveness of reintegration efforts conducted to date, but plans to sign an agreement by the end of December 2018 for a new reintegration program which will include a monitoring and evaluation component.

    "gao_GAO-17-798T": "Why GAO Did This Study Since January 2017, the Navy has suffered four significant mishaps at sea that have resulted in serious damage to Navy ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of the four at sea mishaps that have occurred\u2014two collisions and one grounding\u2014have involved ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which the Navy has assigned ships homeported overseas, (2) the factors used to determine the size and composition of ship crews, and (3) the extent to which the Navy has implemented its readiness rebuilding efforts. This statement is based on GAO's May 2015 report, which examined the Navy's readiness rebuilding efforts. GAO reviewed the Navy's readiness rebuilding efforts and interviewed Navy officials. What GAO Found Since 2006, the Navy has doubled the percentage of its surface combatants and amphibious ships homeported overseas. In 2006, 20 ships were homeported overseas (7 percent of the fleet); today, 40 ships are homeported overseas (14 percent of the fleet) in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and Italy; and an additional destroyer will be homeported in Yokosuka, Japan in 2018. The primary reason that Navy ships homeported overseas provide more deployed time than ships homeported in the United States is that the Navy reduces their training and maintenance periods in order to maximize their operational availability. In May 2015, GAO found that the Navy's operational schedules for overseas-homeported ships limit dedicated training and maintenance periods, resulting in difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. GAO recommended that the Navy develop and implement a sustainable operational schedule for all ships homeported overseas. The Department of Defense (DOD) concurred with this recommendation and reported in 2015 that it had developed revised operational schedules for all ships homeported overseas. However, when GAO contacted DOD to obtain updated information for this testimony, U.S. Pacific Fleet officials stated that the revised operational schedules for the cruisers and destroyers homeported in Japan were still under review and had not been employed. As of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare certifications for cruiser and destroyer crews homeported in Japan had expired, and over two-thirds of the expired certifications\u2014including mobility-seamanship and air warfare\u2014had been expired for 5 months or more. GAO recommended that the Navy develop and implement a sustainable operational schedule for all ships homeported overseas. DOD concurred with this recommendation, but, as of August 2017, it has not conducted an assessment, even though it has continued to increase the number of ships homeported overseas. In the early 2000s, the Navy made several changes to its process for determining the size and composition of ship crews that may contribute to sailor overwork and create readiness and safety risks. These changes were intended to drive down crew sizes in order to save on personnel costs. However, these changes were not substantiated with analysis and may be creating readiness and safety risks. With fewer sailors operating and maintaining surface ships, the material condition of the ships declined, and GAO found that this decline ultimately contributed to an increase in operating and support costs that outweighed any savings on personnel. The Navy eventually reassessed and reversed some of the changes it had made during this period\u2014known as \u201coptimal manning\u201d\u2014but it continued to use a workweek standard that does not reflect the actual time sailors spend working and does not account for in-port workload\u2014both of which may be leading to sailors being overworked. Additionally, heavy workload does not end after ships return to port. Crews typically operate with fewer sailors while in port, so those crew members remaining must cover the workload of multiple sailors, causing additional strain and potential overwork. In May 2016, GAO found that the Navy was having difficulty in implementing its new schedule as intended. Both the public and private shipyards were having difficulty completing maintenance on time, owing primarily to the poor condition of the ships after more than a decade of heavy use, deferred maintenance, and the Navy's inability to accurately predict how much maintenance they would need. GAO reported that in 2011 through 2014 only 28 percent of scheduled maintenance for surface combatants was completed on time and just 11 percent was completed on time for aircraft carriers. GAO updated these data for the purposes of this testimony to include maintenance availabilities completed through the end of fiscal year 2016 and found continued difficulty completing maintenance on time for key portions of the Navy fleet. In September 2016, GAO found that although DOD has stated that readiness rebuilding is a priority, implementation and oversight of department-wide readiness rebuilding efforts did not fully include key elements of sound planning, and the lack of these elements puts the overall rebuilding efforts at risk. The Navy identified carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups",
    "gao_GAO-19-7": "Why GAO Did This Study BLM oversees the development of oil and gas resources on federal and Indian lands. BLM's Inspection and Enforcement program is intended to ensure that operators developing oil and gas resources do so in a manner that protects public safety, environmental health, and royalty income. This is a complex undertaking that occurs within the oil and gas market and requires BLM's inspectors to conduct technically challenging drilling, production, and plugging inspections. GAO was asked to review BLM's Inspection and Enforcement program. This report examines (1) the distribution of BLM's workload and workforce among the 33 BLM field offices with ongoing oil and gas development activities, (2) the number and amount of monetary assessments and civil penalties issued by BLM field offices, and (3) the extent to which BLM has completed all required internal control reviews of its field offices. GAO analyzed BLM data on the workload and workforce of the 33 field offices and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The distribution of the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) workload and the workforce among the 33 BLM field offices with ongoing oil and gas development activities showed an imbalance, based on GAO analysis of BLM data. BLM took both short- and long-term actions to address this imbalance, such as temporarily re-assigning inspectors from some medium activity offices to some of the highest activity offices. Based on GAO's review of BLM documentation and interviews with agency officials, two key factors affected the distribution of the program's workload: (1) energy market changes (e.g., price fluctuations) and (2) BLM actions to plan and prioritize inspection workload (e.g., changing risk classification for production inspections and decreasing the number of work months for plugging inspections). These factors affected several aspects of the program's workload (i.e., wells drilled, production inspection cases, planned plugging work months, and enforcement actions). For example, the number of wells drilled declined from about 400 in fiscal year 2012 to about 330 in fiscal year 2016. BLM changed its methodology to identify and classify risk, which led to fluctuations in the number of high-priority production inspection cases in a given fiscal year. BLM officials said that it was difficult to identify the specific reasons for year-to-year changes in the number of their high-priority production cases. BLM officials said that their ability to complete more high-priority production inspections increases during times of reduced industry drilling activity. Specifically, if industry is drilling fewer new wells, BLM can apply additional resources toward inspecting currently producing wells because inspectors who would normally conduct drilling inspections can now be deployed to high-priority production inspections. BLM reduced the estimated number of plugging inspection work months from about 200 in fiscal year 2012 to about 155 in fiscal year 2016, or about 23 percent. BLM field offices issued about 45 percent of all enforcement actions, 75 percent of all monetary assessments, and about 85 percent of all civil penalties. BLM state offices did not complete internal control reviews at 27 of 33 field offices\u2014including 5 of the 6 highest activity offices GAO identified. According to BLM's July 2012 oversight policy, state offices are to periodically conduct internal control reviews of their field offices to, among other things, (1) review whether inspections and enforcement actions are accurate, complete, and conducted in accordance with policy, (2) review staffing and training needs, and (3) identify areas where program guidance can be improved. BLM state offices completed internal control reviews at 6 of 33 field offices from 2013 through 2017 and scheduled reviews for 5 others from 2018 through 2020, as shown in the table. However, BLM did not complete reviews at 27 field offices, including 5 of the 6 highest activity field offices GAO identified. Federal standards for internal control state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such as by comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and analyzing significant differences. Without employing a risk-informed approach to scheduling and conducting internal control reviews that takes into account the risks to the Inspection and Enforcement program, such as those inherent in field offices' workload and workforce, BLM will not have reasonable assurance that it has adequate controls in place to address the effect of the field offices that pose the greatest risk to the program. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that BLM (1) identify the reasons it did not complete internal control reviews (e.g., human capital and workforce challenges), develop and implement a plan to address those reasons, and monitor state offices' progress toward completing required reviews. Interior concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-455": "Why GAO Did This Study Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) play a vital role in providing higher education opportunities for African-Americans. However, HBCUs continue to face challenges in securing financing to undertake needed capital projects. As a result, these colleges may be unable to make the campus improvements necessary to attract and retain students, potentially jeopardizing their long-term sustainability. In 2006, GAO recommended that Education consider alternatives to the escrow pool requirement, and Education submitted a legislative proposal to Congress, most recently in 2017, to require fees instead. In 2011, federal law authorized Education to further modify the terms and conditions of the Capital Financing Program for four HBCUs. GAO was asked to review the Capital Financing Program. This report examines (1) HBCUs' capital project needs; (2) funding sources HBCUs use to address their capital project needs; and (3) the extent to which Education helps HBCUs access and successfully participate in the program. GAO surveyed HBCUs, analyzed Education data, and interviewed officials from Education, HBCU organizations, and stakeholders. GAO also visited nine HBCUs in three states. What GAO Found Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)\u2014those with historically black missions and institutions\u2014reported that, on average, 46 percent of their building space needed to be repaired or replaced. HBCUs, planning documents, and GAO site visits identified three main reasons for capital project needs: a backlog of deferred maintenance, HBCUs' efforts to modernize campuses to be more competitive, and historical building requirements. HBCUs primarily rely on a few funding sources to address capital project needs, such as state grants and appropriations for public HBCUs and private giving and tuition and fees for private HBCUs. Officials from almost half of the HBCUs GAO interviewed (7 of 15) said relying on a few funding sources can affect a college's ability to fund capital projects. Education officials and several stakeholders also said this reliance can put the HBCUs at a financial disadvantage when seeking additional external funding, such as from the bond market. Fewer than half of HBCUs, or 46 of the 99 HBCUs that are eligible, have used the HBCU Capital Financing Program to fund capital projects, according to Education data. HBCUs have borrowed over $2 billion, with private HBCUs representing about two-thirds of the loan volume. Education has taken some steps to increase awareness of the Capital Financing Program, but some HBCUs and university system officials reported in GAO's survey and interviews that they were unaware of the 26-year-old program. Education officials said they attend a range of conferences and events in the HBCU and higher education communities to increase awareness of the program, such as conferences with higher education business officers and an annual national HBCU conference. However, about a quarter of non-participating HBCUs that responded to GAO's survey said they were unaware of the program. Officials from one state university system also reported they were unaware of the program. HBCUs and state university systems may be unaware of the Capital Financing Program because Education does not target its outreach in two key ways. First, Education does not reach out to or communicate program information directly with state university systems, which oversee groups of public universities\u2014both HBCUs and non-HBCUs\u2014supported by an individual state, even though public colleges accounted for half of all HBCUs in 2016. Second, Education has not systematically coordinated with states to address other laws or policies that create challenges or to identify potential solutions to help more public HBCUs participate in the program. Federal internal control standards state that agency management should communicate key information needed to achieve its objectives and plan for significant changes, including economic changes, analyze the effects of such plans, and respond appropriately. Federal internal control standards also state that agency management should plan for significant external events, analyze its effects on achieving program goals, and appropriately respond to those events. Analyzing the effects of loan modifications, including recently authorized deferments, to help colleges avoid default and successfully participate in the program, and on the potential costs absorbed by Education of delayed or reduced payments, would enable Education to fulfill this responsibility. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Education (1) increase outreach to individual HBCUs so that HBCU officials are informed of the program; (2) coordinate directly with state university systems to specifically address state-level challenges to participation and share potential solutions to increase public HBCU participation; and (3) analyze the potential benefits of loan modifications to all participating HBCUs against the potential risks to",

DOD's public water systems are required to comply with EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations. EPA regulates drinking water contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to manage contaminants in drinking water. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) internally reported data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations at military installations and used those data to assess compliance at its two types of public water systems and (2) taken actions to address concerns with its firefighting foam containing perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) and to address elevated levels of PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations. GAO analyzed DOD's data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations at DOD public water systems for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review. GAO also interviewed DOD and EPA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has not internally reported all data on compliance with health-based drinking water regulations at its two types of public water systems or used available data to evaluate differences between its two types of public water systems. For the years GAO reviewed\u2014fiscal years 2013 through 2015\u2014the military departments annually reported information internally to ASD (ASD) on compliance with EPA and state health-based drinking water regulations, which indicate that drinking water quality at DOD public water systems was similar to other systems in the United States. However, not all violations of health-based regulations were reported to ASD (EI&E) during this time frame, as is required by DOD policy. The military departments reported that a total of 77 military installations had at least one violation at some point from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015, but GAO found that at least 16 additional installations had violations that were reported to EPA but were not internally reported to ASD (EI&E). DOD also has not used available compliance data to identify why DOD public water systems that provide DOD-treated drinking water appear to have more violations of health-based regulations than DOD systems that provide non-DOD-treated drinking water. DOD has not used available data to assess why DOD public water systems providing DOD-treated drinking water appear to have more violations of health-based drinking water regulations than systems providing non-DOD-treated drinking water. Although GAO found that not all violations were reported by the military departments to ASD (EI&E), the data that were reported during fiscal years 2013 through 2015 indicated that about 99 percent of the people who received non-DOD-treated drinking water were served by systems with no violations, while about 89 percent of the people who received DOD-treated drinking water were served by systems with no violations. When GAO asked ASD (EI&E) and military department officials why these differences may exist, they were unable to provide an explanation because they had not used the reported water quality data to identify the reasons why DOD public water systems providing DOD-treated water appear to have more violations than systems providing non-DOD-treated drinking water. Although some officials offered ideas on the reasons for differences in compliance\u2014including the relative expertise of utilities and private companies, versus DOD, in providing drinking water\u2014DOD officials acknowledged that the agency has not evaluated the data to identify specific reasons for why the differences may exist. Without reviewing the data reported by the military departments to identify why there appear to be differences in violations between DOD's two types of public water systems and without identifying and implementing any actions to address any differences, ASD (EI&E) and the military departments may not be able to improve overall compliance with health-based drinking water regulations. DOD is taking steps to address health and environmental concerns with its use of firefighting foam that contains PFCs\u2014including PFOS and PFOA\u2014to include restricting the use of foam at its installations and funding research into the development of a PFC-free foam that can meet DOD performance requirements. DOD also has responded to EPA and state orders and initiated additional actions to address elevated levels of PFOS, PFOA, and perchlorate in drinking water at or near military installations. For example, DOD has initiated mitigation actions, which include installing treatment systems or supplying bottled water, to address PFOS and PFOA in drinking water for people living outside 19 installations\u20145 of which GAO visited during the course of this review. According to DOD data, these installations took various corrective actions to mitigate the presence of PFOS and PFOA in",
    "gao_GAO-18-615": "Why GAO Did This Study The ARB is a mechanism to foster more effective security of U.S. missions and personnel abroad by ensuring a thorough and independent review of security-related incidents. In August 2017, the U.S. embassy in Cuba reported that it had received a number of allegations of serious injuries from U.S. personnel and family members. The Senate report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the ARB. This report examines (1) the extent to which State's ARB incident vetting process ensures that the Office responsible is made aware of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property at U.S. missions abroad and (2) the extent to which the U.S. embassy in Cuba and several State entities responded to incidents that were later associated with various injuries in early 2017. GAO reviewed relevant laws, policies, and reports; analyzed State's ARB incident vetting process; and interviewed State officials. What GAO Found The Department of State's (State) Office of Management and Budget (M/PRI) is responsible for initiating and shepherding the incident vetting process to identify incidents that may warrant an ARB. M/PRI is responsible for initiating and shepherding the ARB incident vetting process once M/PRI becomes aware of an incident abroad that could involve loss of life, injury, or destruction of property. This process includes consultation with the Office of the Legal Adviser (Legal), the Department of State's Office of the Coordinator for Cuban Affairs (DS), and other offices as appropriate to evaluate whether the ARB statute criteria apply. If the ARB statute criteria are deemed applicable or if the applicability is questionable, M/PRI is responsible for calling a meeting of State's ARB Permanent Coordinating Committee. The Secretary of State makes the final decision on whether to convene an ARB. The U.S. Embassy in Havana is supported by several State entities. WHA, DS, and MED, among other State entities, support the U.S. embassy in Havana by providing advice and guidance on policy, security, and other issues. The U.S. Embassy in Havana is supported by the U.S. Department of State's (State) Office of the Under Secretary of State for Management (M/PRI). M/PRI is responsible for initiating and leading the ARB incident vetting process, including convening the Permanent Coordinating Committee. However, State's ARB policy does not define how M/PRI should become aware of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. State's policies do not define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. State's policies do not define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. State's Office of the Inspector General previously found deficiencies in State's internal communication of incidents that may meet ARB criteria. Despite State's 2006 cable on potential ARB incident reporting, in 2013, State's Inspector General found that State had no systematic process ensuring immediate notification of security-related incidents to M/PRI, and that DS did not routinely provide security reports to M/PRI. The Inspector General made an informal recommendation that DS should include M/PRI as an addressee on all security-related incident reports. State's policies do not define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. State's policies do not define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property. Until State establishes policies that ensure the appropriate office is promptly aware of potentially relevant incidents\u2014for example, policies that identify formal internal communication procedures and document responsibilities for such communication\u2014State is at risk of failing to comply with the ARB statute. Improving its security programs at U.S. diplomatic posts is all the more imperative given recent reports of similar incidents, such as in Guangzhou, China. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State revise its policies to define responsibilities for internal communication to M/PRI of incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property at, or related to, U.S. missions abroad. State concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-420": "Why GAO Did This Study The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for designing, constructing, renovating, altering, and repairing federal buildings. GSA's Design Excellence Program, which began in 1994, aims to create unique and aesthetically pleasing workspaces, have met the functional needs of tenant agencies, and have become public landmarks. GAO was asked to review the extent to which (1) GSA made design choices that affect operations and maintenance (O&M) costs; (2) GSA considers O&M costs and functionality when planning and designing buildings; and (3) GSA systematically collects and shares information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. GAO surveyed 78 GSA building managers at 10 Design Excellence buildings, visited 10 buildings, and interviewed GSA officials and tenants. What GAO Found GSA has made design choices in some Design Excellence buildings intended to reduce long-term O&M costs. For example, all 10 of the Design Excellence buildings were designed to include interior natural light, which some building managers reported reduced energy costs. In addition, all 10 of the Design Excellence buildings were designed to include durable and easily maintained materials and finishes, such as natural light and low maintenance landscaping. According to GSA officials, some design choices, such as multistory atriums and custom windows, have resulted in increased O&M costs compared to an average GSA building without those features. For example, 67 out of 78 building managers for Design Excellence buildings stated that the effect of including multistory open spaces, like atriums, increased O&M costs due to the challenges associated with heating and cooling, making needed repairs, and cleaning these spaces. GSA does not fully consider how design choices may affect the O&M costs of Design Excellence buildings. Specifically, GSA's procedures for planning, designing, and constructing new Design Excellence buildings focus on design creativity, construction challenges, budget, and schedule and do not direct GSA to estimate O&M costs during planning and design. While these procedures promote several factors to consider in a building's design\u2014including aesthetics, functionality, and constructability\u2014and generally require firms to submit documentation on budget and schedule, they do not call for information on expected O&M costs. In addition, these procedures do not include seeking input on design decisions from facilities personnel who will have responsibility for the ongoing O&M once the building is occupied. Federal standards for internal control state that federal agencies should use complete and relevant information when making decisions and design control activities, including procedures, to achieve objectives. Without procedures that clearly emphasize the need to more fully consider O&M costs in Design Excellence buildings during the planning and design stage, GSA and other stakeholders may not have a complete picture of all relevant information necessary to make informed decisions on how to best design future federal buildings. GSA has sometimes made design choices in buildings that do not apply to one of the primary functional goals of the Design Excellence Program\u2014to serve as a landmark that positively represents the federal government to the public. Specifically, GSA does not consider that some buildings, due to their purpose or location, are unlikely to function as landmarks because they have limited interaction with or limited visibility by the public. In this regard, GSA does not consider that some buildings, due to their purpose or location, are unlikely to function as landmarks because they have limited interaction with or limited visibility by the public. GSA officials stated that they are considering formalizing this sort of information collection and sharing as part of the Operational Excellence process, but as of March 2018, GSA has not established a schedule for completing its actions or updating its procedures. Without a formalized process for systematically collecting and sharing how design choices affected O&M costs in existing buildings, designs for future Design Excellence buildings may not benefit from the successful strategies used by others to reduce O&M costs or may continue to repeat problematic choices that may result in increased O&M costs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that GSA (1) estimate the full O&M costs of design choices in the planning and design process for new Design Excellence buildings; (2) consider the functionality of design choices during the planning and design stage; and (3) systematically collect and share information on O&M costs related to design choices in existing buildings. GSA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

The Department of Defense (DOD) has a long-standing interest in reducing the risk of fraud and waste by transferring excess controlled property to law enforcement agencies. The Department of Defense (DOD) has a long-standing interest in reducing the risk of fraud and waste by transferring excess controlled property to law enforcement agencies. In July 2017, GAO reported that DLA had weaknesses in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property. This statement discusses (1) the uses and benefits of the transfer of DOD excess controlled property, (2) DLA's actions to address weaknesses in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property, and (3) DLA's internal controls for preventing fraud. This statement is based on GAO's July 2017 report, which examined DLA's processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property. GAO reviewed DLA policies and procedures, interviewed DLA officials, and conducted independent testing of the LESO program's internal controls. What GAO Found Federal law enforcement agencies and state coordinators in GAO's survey\u2014as well as officials GAO interviewed from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies\u2014reported various uses of DOD excess controlled property for law enforcement activities. The reported uses included enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities. Also, law enforcement agencies reported using DOD's excess controlled property for other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue, natural disaster response, surveillance, reaching barricaded suspects, police training, and the serving of warrants. Federal, state, and local agencies cited a number of ways in which they had benefited from the transfer of controlled property, with several reporting that the transfers of controlled property allowed them to save money. For example, a local law enforcement official in Texas reported that 96 percent of the department budget goes to salaries and that the LESO program helped the department acquire items that it would otherwise not be able to afford, saving the department an estimated $2 million to $3 million. Additionally, agencies provided examples of how property they received through the LESO program have been used. For example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs officials reported they have used vehicles to support their Office of Justice Services' drug unit during marijuana eradication and border operations by providing transport to agents over inhospitable terrain in mountainous and desert environments. Moreover, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported that it used a robot to remove a rifle from an attempted murder suspect who had barricaded himself. DLA has taken some steps to address previously identified weaknesses in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled property through revisions to its policy and procedures on the management, oversight, and accountability of the LESO program. Such revisions were made, in part, because of recommendations made by the DOD and DLA Offices of Inspector General. GAO found weaknesses in three areas: (1) verifying and approving applications, (2) transferring property, and (3) the assessment of risk. First, GAO's independent testing of the LESO program's internal controls identified deficiencies in the processes for verifying and approving federal agency applications. Specifically, GAO investigators posing as authorized federal law enforcement officials of a fictitious agency applied and were granted access to the LESO program in early 2017. GAO investigators subsequently submitted requests to obtain controlled property, including non-lethal items and potentially-lethal items if modified with commercially available items. GAO investigators scheduled appointments and obtained the controlled property items, such as night-vision goggles, reflex (also known as reflectors) sights, infrared illuminators, simulated pipe bombs, and simulated rifles. GAO investigators scheduled appointments and obtained the controlled property items, such as those shown in the photos below. Second, GAO investigators, after being approved to participate in the LESO program, obtained access to the department's online systems to view and request controlled property. GAO subsequently submitted requests to obtain controlled property, including non-lethal items and potentially-lethal items if modified with commercially available items.

    "gao_GAO-18-552": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing all modes of transportation, including civil aviation. TSOs perform a critical role in securing the nation's commercial aviation system. TSA established the TSO Basic Training program at the TSA Academy in 2016 to provide TSOs with a dedicated facility with simulated checkpoints. GAO was asked to review TSO Basic Training. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA established the program and the factors considered in updating the curriculum, and (2) the extent to which TSA has implemented a training evaluation model to assess the program. GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials. GAO also interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) established the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) Basic Training program at the TSA Academy to obtain benefits from centralized training. According to the business case for TSO Basic Training and TSA officials, implementation of the TSO Basic Training program at the Academy was anticipated to provide a number of potential benefits. The anticipated benefits identified generally align under two distinct categories: (1) efficiencies and improvements obtained through the centralized delivery of training, and (2) enhanced professionalism and \"esprit de corps\" obtained through bringing newly hired screeners together for centralized training. Collectively, these benefits were also envisioned by TSA headquarters officials to have a positive impact on screening effectiveness and public perception of the TSA workforce. Factors considered in updating the TSO Basic Training curriculum include evolving security threats and input from course participants. For example, TSA officials told GAO that the Office of Terrorism and Explosive Threats (OTD) uses information from the Office of Screening Operations (OSO) to update the TSO Basic Training curriculum to address evolving security threats. TSA officials told GAO that OSO plans to implement a new model for TSO Basic Training in which TSOs will attend TSO Basic Training 2 to 6 months after they are hired rather than as soon as is practical. TSA officials told GAO that they are preparing for the change by modifying the TSO Basic Training curriculum to eliminate subjects that will be covered at the airports and to emphasize skills that more experienced TSOs will need, such as performing physical searches of passengers. TSA officials told GAO that they regularly review the results of the survey and consider whether it is appropriate to address the feedback by modifying TSO Basic Training. TSA has implemented three of the four levels of the Kirkpatrick Model, a training evaluation model that, in part, helps TSA collect feedback from course participants and evaluate the impact on individual development. However, the agency has not developed goals for the program or related performance measures to demonstrate progress toward goals. TSA reported potential benefits of TSO Basic Training in its business case and implemented the Kirkpatrick Model to assess training, but it has not yet identified specific goals that the TSO Basic Training program is expected to achieve, nor has it developed performance measures to evaluate progress toward goals. The business case and the Kirkpatrick Model are positive steps and document certain benefits of TSO Basic Training, but without a set of specific training goals and associated performance measures for the program, TSA is not able to fully evaluate the program's effectiveness and ensure accountability toward results. Such goals are important to help ensure alignment with course objectives and the end-of-course examinations administered as part of Level 2 of the Kirkpatrick Model. In addition, without the development of specific goals, it is not possible to determine what types of performance measures should be used to help show progress toward such goals. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that TSA establish specific goals for the TSO Basic Training program and develop performance measures that can be used to assess if the program is achieving desired outcomes and help ensure accountability for training results on a regular basis. DHS agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-42": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars on IT projects, including IT-related acquisitions. However, these projects often have not been disciplined and effective management. In 2014, Congress enacted FITARA, which requires agencies to improve the management of IT. GAO was asked to review the implementation of FITARA. This report examines the extent to which (1) federal agencies identify IT contracts and how much is invested in them, and (2) federal agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) are reviewing and approving IT acquisitions. GAO analyzed a random sample of 78,249 IT-related contracts at 22 agencies, selected based on their IT spending, and compared the resulting documentation to FITARA and OMB guidance. GAO also interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The 22 selected agencies identified 78,249 information technology (IT)-related contracts, to which they obligated approximately $14.7 billion in fiscal year 2016. Of that amount, approximately $14 billion was categorized as IT-related, consistent with the Category Management Leadership Council and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) product and service codes, and approximately $626 million was categorized under other, non-IT codes. The associated agencies obligated approximately $4.5 billion to these contracts, raising the total amount obligated to IT contracts in fiscal year 2016 to at least approximately $19.2 billion. The majority of the selected agencies that did not identify the approximately $4.5 billion in IT obligations also did not follow OMB's guidance to have the Chief Acquisition Officer (CIO) identify all IT acquisitions for CIO review and approval. Until agencies involve the acquisition office in their IT identification processes, and establish and effectively implement supporting guidance, they will likely not be able to ensure that all IT acquisitions are identified. As a result, agencies risk not having appropriate oversight of IT worth billions of dollars. Most of the processes at the 22 selected agencies do not fully satisfy OMB's requirements that the CIO review and approve IT acquisitions. Specifically, 8 agencies' processes fully satisfy OMB's requirements, while 14 of the agencies' processes do not fully satisfy the requirements. Of these, 8 agencies partially satisfy the requirements and 6 do not satisfy the requirements. For example, the National Science Foundation fully satisfies OMB's requirement by requiring that the CIO review and approve each IT acquisition plan. Similarly, the Small Business Administration requires the CIO to review and approve each IT acquisition plan over the FAR's simplified acquisition threshold. HUD partially satisfies OMB's requirement in that its process only requires the office of the CIO to review a subset of IT acquisitions (those over $500,000). In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban Development partially satisfies OMB's requirement in that its process only requires the office of the CIO to review a subset of IT acquisitions (those over $500,000). In addition, the Department of Labor (Labor) partially satisfies OMB's requirement in that its process only requires the office of the CIO to review a subset of IT acquisitions (those over $500,000). In addition, the Department of the Interior partially satisfies OMB's requirement in that its process only requires the office of the CIO to review a subset of IT acquisitions (those over $500,000). In addition, the Department of the Interior has delegated the approval authority to the Deputy CIO and others within the Office of the CIO, but this delegation has not been approved by OMB. VA does not yet have a process in place that satisfies OMB's requirements, but officials in VA's Office of Information and Technology stated that they are currently developing processes and procedures necessary to implement FITARA accountability and responsibilities for IT acquisitions. While the agency did not submit a documented time frame for its plans, VA officials stated that they would like to implement the new process by the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. What GAO Recommends GAO is making 39 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations. Of these 39 recommendations, GAO is making 39 recommendations to the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Social Security Administration, and the Social Security Administration. The agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-17-795T": "Why GAO Did This Study SSA is responsible for processing disability claims for individuals with certain conditions. CAL is a process that allows SSA to expedite the processing of disability claims for individuals with certain conditions. SSA has not always used the CAL process to ensure that the claims it approves are accurate and consistent. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which SSA has a formal and systematic approach for identifying CAL conditions, (2) the extent to which SSA ensures that claims are accurately identified for expedited CAL processing, and (3) the steps SSA takes to ensure the accuracy and consistency of decisions on CAL claims. This statement is based on GAO's August 2017 report, CAL: SSA Needs to Develop a Formal and Systematic Approach for Identifying CAL Conditions (GAO-17-68), and its August 2017 report, CAL: SSA Needs to Develop a Formal and Systematic Approach for Identifying CAL Conditions (GAO-17-68). GAO reviewed SSA's CAL webpage, reviewed relevant federal internal control standards, and interviewed SSA officials. What GAO Found The Social Security Administration (SSA) has in recent years relied on advocates for individuals with certain diseases and disorders to bring potential CAL conditions to its attention. However, SSA has not clearly communicated this or provided guidance on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, which communicates information to the public. Without more explicit instructions, GAO noted that advocates may not present information that is relevant for SSA's decision-making or that most strongly makes the case for these conditions to be included on the CAL list. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives. GAO concluded that absent clear guidance to advocates on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, SSA is missing an opportunity to gather quality information to inform its selection of CAL conditions. In addition, GAO found that relying on advocates to bring conditions to SSA's attention also introduces potential bias toward certain conditions and the possibility of missing others. Some conditions that are potentially deserving of CAL consideration may not have advocacy organizations affiliated with them, and some advocates may be unaware of CAL. As a result, some conditions may have a better chance of being considered than other, equally deserving ones that are not proposed, and individuals with those conditions may have to wait longer to receive approval for disability benefits. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives. GAO concluded that absent clear guidance to advocates on how to make suggestions through its CAL webpage, SSA is missing an opportunity to gather quality information to inform its selection of CAL conditions. In addition, GAO found that SSA has not developed or communicated clear, consistent criteria for deciding which potential conditions will be included on the CAL list. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should define objectives in specific and measurable terms so that they are understood at all levels of the agency and performance toward achieving these objectives can be assessed. GAO concluded that absent clear criteria for designating CAL conditions, advocates and other stakeholders may be confused as to why some conditions are not included on the CAL list and SSA may miss conditions that could qualify for CAL. SSA's procedures do not ensure all claims are accurately identified for expedited CAL processing. SSA primarily relies on software that searches for key words in claims. However, because text provided by claimants may be ambiguous, incomplete, inaccurate, or misspelled, the software is hindered in its ability to flag all claimants with CAL conditions and may also flag claimants for CAL processing that should not be flagged. For example, officials GAO interviewed at 5 of the 6 selected Disability Determination Services (DDS) offices said that they have seen claims inaccurately flagged for CAL when the claim text included words like \u201cfamily history of\u201d though the CAL condition was not asserted by the claimant. In addition, GAO found that DDS offices varied in their use of manual actions to add the CAL flag to claims that were not initially flagged for CAL by the software. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should record transactions in an accurate and timely fashion. GAO concluded that without clear guidance on when to make manual changes, DDS examiners may continue to take actions that are not timely and may hinder expedited processing and accurate tracking of CAL claims. GAO recommended that SSA clarify written policies and procedures regarding when manual addition and removal of CAL flags should occur on individual claims. SSA agreed with this recommendation. GAO also found that SSA has taken some steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of decisions on CAL claims, including developing detailed descriptions of CAL conditions, known as impairment summaries, but",
    "gao_GAO-17-794": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA has spent billions of dollars on a range of aviation security programs with the goal of detecting, disrupting, and deterring threats. However, TSA does not have a complete understanding of the contributions these programs are making to this goal. Specifically, TSA has some information on how well it can detect and disrupt threats and is taking steps to improve this information, but does not have information on its ability to deter attacks\u2014a key component of TSA's goal. GAO was asked to review TSA's aviation security countermeasures. This report examines (1) the effectiveness of selected countermeasures in detecting and disrupting threats to aviation security and (2) the extent to which TSA has a means to assess the deterrent effect of these countermeasures. GAO analyzed TSA's fiscal year 2015 cost data for six selected countermeasures\u2014passenger prescreening, checkpoint screening, checked baggage screening, explosives detection canines, and the Behavior Detection and Analysis (BDA) program\u2014and interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) collected fiscal year 2015 data on the effectiveness of four of the six countermeasures GAO selected\u2014passenger prescreening, checkpoint screening, checked baggage screening, and explosives detection canines\u2014in detecting or disrupting threats to passenger aviation security. TSA assesses this effectiveness differently for each of these four countermeasures. For example, TSA assessed the effectiveness of its passenger prescreening countermeasure in detecting passengers that may pose a threat to aviation security by measuring the percentage of airline passenger records vetted through its Secure Flight system and the number of high-risk passengers identified. In contrast, TSA assessed the effectiveness of its canine program in detecting and disrupting potential security threats by measuring canine-handler team performance during their annual certification tests as well as covert scenario-based tests called short notice assessments (SNA). Some of the effectiveness data TSA has for fiscal year 2015 are of limited reliability and TSA is taking steps to improve this information. For example, GAO reported in September 2016 that checkpoint and baggage screening effectiveness data from TSA's Aviation Screening Assessment Program (ASAP) Advantage covert tests conducted in fiscal year 2015 were not reliable. Specifically, TSA found that TSOs performed more poorly in ASAP tests conducted by an independent contractor than in the same tests conducted by local TSA personnel at the same airports. This raised questions about the validity of ASAP tests conducted by local TSA personnel and indicated that TSA's fiscal year 2015 ASAP pass rates likely showed a higher level of TSO performance in screening for prohibited items than was actually the case. In response to this issue, and to provide ongoing quality assurance for field-based covert testing results, in April 2016, TSA began deploying headquarters-based covert testing teams in both the checkpoint and checked baggage screening environments. TSA officials stated that comparing the results of field- and headquarters-based tests provides TSA with a useful indication of whether or not the field-based covert testing results are valid. In addition, some fiscal year 2015 effectiveness data indicate vulnerabilities in the agency's ability to detect and disrupt threats to aviation security. For example, results from covert testing conducted by TSA's Office of Operational Inspection during fiscal year 2015 indicate vulnerabilities in the checkpoint and checked baggage screening systems. TSA does not have a means to measure progress toward its goal of deterring attacks on the U.S. aviation system. TSA officials have cited the deterrent effect of various countermeasures\u2014including the Behavior Detection and Analysis (BDA) program, canine teams, behavior detection officers (BDO), and advanced imaging technology (AIT) machines\u2014but does not have information on the deterrent effect of any of these countermeasures. For example, TSA officials explained that canine teams that patrol airports\u2014searching unattended bags and unattended vehicles, among other activities\u2014provide a deterrent presence at airports, but officials noted that they do not have any data on these canines' deterrent effect. TSA officials told GAO that developing a means to assess TSA's deterrent effect would be difficult and require a multi-year effort but having such a means would be helpful. TSA officials told GAO that developing a means to assess TSA's deterrent effect would be difficult and require a multi-year effort but having such a means would be helpful.

    "gao_GAO-19-42": "Why GAO Did This Study The Arctic is warming and its sea ice is diminishing. However, the ice that remains will continue to be a challenge to those operating in the area. GAO has previously reported that the United States faces challenges in navigating the Arctic. GAO was asked to review the status of the Arctic. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Navy's report aligns with current assessments of Arctic threat levels and capabilities required to execute DOD's 2016 Arctic Strategy and (2) the extent to which the Navy has a capability requirement for ice-hardening existing vessels or for the construction of new ones. GAO reviewed the Navy's June 2018 report and interviewed officials from the Navy, U.S. Northern Command, and Coast Guard. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of State provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated into this report as appropriate. What GAO Found The Navy's June 2018 report aligns with current assessments of Arctic threat levels and capabilities required to execute the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2016 Arctic Strategy. Specifically, the report provides information on current naval capabilities in the Arctic region, with a particular emphasis on surface capabilities. The Navy also discusses the significant limitations of its surface ships for Arctic operations. The Navy's June 2018 report provides information on any gaps in the current naval capabilities that require ice-hardening of existing vessels or the construction of new vessels to preserve freedom of navigation in the Arctic region whenever and wherever necessary. The Navy stated that there are currently no validated capability gaps that require the Navy to ice-harden existing vessels or construct new ice-capable vessels to preserve freedom of navigation in the Arctic. Furthermore, the Navy stated that its current assets are sufficient to execute the 2016 DOD Arctic Strategy. The Navy's June 2018 report provides information on the analysis and recommendation for ice-hardening vessels. The Navy stated that it is not pursuing ice-hardening or the winterization of surface ships. According to the Navy, because there is no specific capability requirement for the Navy to ice-harden ships, the report does not list or name potential ice-hardening candidates among existing vessels or provide cost or schedule estimates for ice-hardening vessels. Navy officials stated that the Navy or Joint Force is unlikely to produce such a requirement in the near term. Navy officials stated that the Navy will continue to use DOD's established process, the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), to assess Arctic-related capability requirements in the near and long term. The JCIDS process is an early part of the JCIDS process, and informs updates to capability requirement documents related to specific materiel and nonmateriel capability solutions to be pursued.

    "gao_GAO-18-566T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for IT in fiscal year 2018. Despite such large expenditures, GAO has previously reported that investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. In addition, security deficiencies can threaten systems once they become operational. In 2014, Congress enacted the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which was intended to improve covered agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. This testimony addresses (1) the status of FITARA and FISMA, and (2) the extent to which agencies have addressed the IT acquisitions and operations high-risk area. This statement is based on GAO's February 2017 high-risk update and selected updates issued from July 2011 through August 2017. GAO reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and reports; interviewed agency officials; and analyzed agency-reported data on IT consolidation and optimization. What GAO Found Congress has recognized the importance of agencies' continued implementation of FITARA provisions, and has taken legislative action to extend selected provisions beyond their original dates of expiration. Specifically, Congress and the President enacted laws to: remove the expiration date for enhanced transparency and improved risk management provisions, which were set to expire in 2019; remove the expiration date for portfolio review, which was set to expire in 2019; and extend the expiration date for the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative from 2018 to 2020. In addition, Congress and the President enacted a law to authorize the availability of funding mechanisms to help further agencies' efforts to modernize IT. The law, known as the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, authorizes agencies to establish working capital funds for use in transitioning from legacy IT systems, as well as for addressing evolving threats to information security. The law also creates the Technology Modernization Fund, within the Department of the Treasury, from which agencies can \"borrow\" money to retire and replace legacy systems, as well as acquire or develop systems. In addition, Congress and the President enacted the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government-wide responsibilities. The act addresses the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks, promotes the use of automated security tools with the ability to continuously monitor and diagnose the security posture of federal agencies, and provides for improved oversight of federal agencies' information security programs. Among other things, the act clarifies and assigns additional responsibilities to entities such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the federal agencies. In addition, GAO's February 2017 high-risk update to this high-risk series highlighted the need for agencies to address the IT acquisitions and operations high-risk area. GAO's preliminary results from a draft report on CIO responsibilities that GAO has provided to the 24 selected agencies for comment and plan to issue in June 2018, suggest that none of the 24 agencies had policies that fully addressed the role of their Chief Information Officer (CIO). In this regard, a majority of the agencies fully or substantially addressed the role of their CIOs for the area of leadership and accountability. In addition, a majority of the agencies substantially or partially addressed the role of their CIOs for two areas: information security and IT budgeting. However, most agencies partially or minimally addressed the role of their CIOs for two areas: investment management and strategic planning. GAO's preliminary results also indicate that shortcomings in agencies' policies also are partially attributable to two weaknesses in OMB's FITARA implementation guidance. First, the guidance does not comprehensively address all CIO responsibilities, such as those related to assessing the extent to which personnel meet IT management knowledge and skill requirements, and ensuring that personnel are held accountable for complying with the information security program. Second, OMB's guidance does not ensure that CIOs have a significant role in (1) IT planning, programming, and budgeting decisions and (2) execution decisions and the management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT, as required by federal law and guidance. In the absence of comprehensive guidance, CIOs will not be positioned to effectively acquire, maintain, and secure their IT systems. In January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. For instance, most of the 22 agencies did not identify all of their IT contracts. In addition, 14 of the 22 agencies did not fully satisfy OMB's requirement that the CIO review and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that",
    "gao_GAO-18-309": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that about 26 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives are living below the poverty line, compared with 14 percent for the nation as a whole. IHS, EPA, USDA, and Reclamation provide financial assistance to tribes for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects. GAO was asked to review the extent to which federal agencies (1) identified Indian tribes' drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs; (2) funded tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects, including projects to address the most severe sanitation deficiencies; and (3) collaborated to meet Indian tribes' drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs. GAO reviewed IHS and EPA data on tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs, interviewed IHS and EPA officials, and surveyed seven federal agencies that administer programs to provide drinking water and wastewater infrastructure assistance to Indian tribes. What GAO Found The Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated costs for tribal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs in fiscal year 2016, but the needs are underestimated. IHS and EPA estimated that at least $3.2 billion in estimated costs for infrastructure projects to address existing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs for fiscal year 2016 and EPA estimated the costs of future tribal drinking water infrastructure needs at an additional $2.4 billion over the following 20 years. However, IHS's estimate of existing needs is likely too low because IHS has not identified all eligible Indian homes that may have existing sanitation deficiencies\u2014drinking water or wastewater infrastructure needs\u2014and some data in the system that IHS uses to track home-specific infrastructure needs are not accurate. By implementing a targeted, resource-efficient method to identify additional eligible Indian homes that may have existing sanitation deficiencies to include in the Home Inventory Tracking System (HITS), IHS could have better assurance that it has more complete information to help improve its estimate of the number of eligible Indian homes that may need sanitation facilities assistance. In fiscal year 2016, federal agencies obligated approximately $370 million for tribal drinking water or wastewater infrastructure projects. The agencies with tribal-specific programs for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure\u2014IHS, EPA, and USDA\u2014funded some projects to address what they identified as the most severe sanitation deficiencies\u2014communities and homes that do not have safe drinking water or wastewater disposal facilities. However, the agencies' processes may not always prioritize projects that address the most severe sanitation deficiencies. For example, USDA's scoring factors for its Native American program do not include a scoring factor category to evaluate the extent to which projects will address health risks that stem from tribes' lack of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. By implementing a scoring factor similar to the one in its Colonias program\u2014that is, one that awards points for proposed projects that address health risks from a lack of access to safe drinking water and wastewater disposal\u2014for the Native American program, USDA would have more assurance that it is evaluating project applications consistently and funding projects to address the most severe sanitation deficiencies in Indian communities, consistent with the program's goal. USDA awarded grants to municipalities and Alaska Native villages from 1997 through 2016, but the agency did not agree that the agency had awarded these grants to ineligible entities because the program's authorizing statute gives the State of Alaska control over the use of the grants. By ensuring that all Rural Alaska Village grants are awarded only to recipients authorized by statute, USDA will have assurance that it is complying with the law. Most of the seven federal agencies that administer programs to provide drinking water and wastewater infrastructure assistance to Indian tribes have taken actions to collaborate at the national level, and the agencies have identified additional opportunities to collaborate. At the regional level, seven federal agencies GAO surveyed reported collaborating on a range of activities within six selected states\u2014with some agencies frequently working together and others rarely collaborating\u2014and the agencies identified opportunities to increase collaboration at the regional level to better serve tribes. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IHS implement a targeted, resource-efficient method to identify additional eligible Indian homes that may have existing sanitation deficiencies to include in HITS; review its project selection processes; and implement a scoring factor that awards points for proposed Native American program projects that address health risks. IHS, EPA, USDA, and Reclamation agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-188": "Why GAO Did This Study SEC is responsible for reviewing companies' financial statements and other disclosures, including climate-related disclosures, in their annual filings. SEC also reviews companies' nonfinancial disclosures, which may include climate-related disclosures. In April 2016, SEC published a Concept Release to seek public comment on modernizing certain business and financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. The Concept Release specifically requested comments about \u201cDisclosure of Information Relating to Public Policy and Sustainability Matters.\u201d The public comment period for the Concept Release ended on July 21, 2016. GAO was asked to review SEC's climate-related disclosures. This report examines (1) steps SEC has taken to help companies understand disclosure requirements for climate-related risks, (2) steps SEC has taken to examine changes in climate-related disclosures since the release of its 2010 Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change (hereafter referred to as the 2010 Guidance), and (3) constraints SEC faces when reviewing climate-related disclosures and stakeholders' views of those disclosures. GAO reviewed SEC documents, including the 2010 Guidance and internal filing review guidance, related to SEC's review of climate-related and other disclosures in companies' annual filings. GAO also interviewed SEC staff and representatives from five industries selected based on their size and industry size. What GAO Found The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued the 2010 Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change (the 2010 Guidance) in April 2016 to clarify companies' existing disclosure requirements as they apply to climate-related matters. SEC staff said the issuance of the 2010 Guidance was the primary form of communication it used to clarify to companies their climate-related disclosure requirements. However, SEC staff also noted that companies should consider the 2010 Guidance along with all other guidance and securities laws and regulations applicable to their filings. SEC staff also examined climate-related disclosures for reports to Congress and issued a Concept Release seeking public input on disclosure requirements. SEC faces constraints in reviewing climate-related disclosures as it primarily relies on information that companies determine is material. SEC may not have details of the information companies used to support their determination of material climate-related risks. Also, this climate-related information varies in format and specificity among companies. SEC has tools, mechanisms, and resources to help ensure that its staff conducts reviews consistently across filings.

    "gao_GAO-18-351": "Why GAO Did This Study The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) provides cash assistance and medical benefits to help eligible black lung beneficiaries with their health. The Trust Fund's debt is primarily obtained from mine operators through the coal tax. The coal tax is imposed at two rates, depending on whether the coal is extracted from underground or surface mines. The current tax rates are $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. The Trust Fund's total debt to Treasury's general fund increased and exceeded $10 billion by fiscal year 2008. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the Trust Fund's debt. This report examines (1) the extent to which (1) black lung disability trust fund debt may change through 2050 and (2) selected options to improve its future financial position. GAO simulated the effects of the scheduled 2019 tax rate decrease on Trust Fund finances through 2050, and simulated options to improve its future financial position. GAO analyzed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from DOL, Treasury, and Health and Human Services (HHS). GAO also simulated the effects of various options to improve the Trust Fund's future financial position. What GAO Found Multiple factors have challenged the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund's (Trust Fund) finances since it was established about 40 years ago. Its expenditures have consistently exceeded its revenue, interest payments have grown, and legislative actions taken that were expected to improve Trust Fund finances did not completely address its debt. Combined black lung benefit payments and program administrative costs exceeded Trust Fund revenue every year for the program's first decade (fiscal years 1979 through 1989), resulting in the accrual of debt. During the Trust Fund's first three fiscal years in particular, revenue covered less than 40 percent of the Trust Fund's combined benefit payments and administrative costs. From fiscal years 1979 through 1989, the Trust Fund borrowed from Treasury's general fund at interest rates that varied from about 6.5 percent to about 13.9 percent. In fiscal year 2017, the Trust Fund's total principal amount of outstanding debt, which includes its legacy debt and the amount borrowed from Treasury's general fund that year, was about $4.3 billion. Trust Fund borrowing will likely continue to increase from fiscal years 2019 through 2050 due, in part, to the scheduled coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that will take effect in 2019 and declining coal production. GAO's moderate case simulation suggests that Trust Fund revenue may decrease, from about $485 million in fiscal year 2018 to about $298 million in fiscal year 2019, due, in part, to the scheduled approximate 55 percent decrease in the coal tax. GAO's moderate case simulation also suggests that the amount borrowed by the Trust Fund will likely increase from about $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2019 to about $15.4 billion in fiscal year 2050. Adjusting coal tax rates, forgiving interest, and forgiving debt are options that could improve the Trust Fund's future financial position. GAO simulated the effects of (1) adjusting the coal tax, (2) forgiving interest, and (3) forgiving debt.

    "gao_GAO-18-145": "Why GAO Did This Study The Select Agent Program regulates the transfer of biological agents, such as anthrax, to high-containment laboratories to protect the public from the risks they may pose to laboratory workers and the public. The program is administered by CDC and APHIS, both of which have high-containment laboratories registered with the program. GAO was asked to review the Select Agent Program. This report examines (1) the extent to which the program meets key elements of effective oversight, (2) the extent to which selected countries and regulatory sectors promote effective oversight, and (3) the extent to which the Select Agent Program has a mechanism to promote effective oversight. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials and laboratory representatives from CDC and APHIS, as well as experts from the National Academy of Sciences. What GAO Found The Select Agent Program does not fully meet key elements of effective oversight. In particular, the program has oversight shortcomings related to independence, performing reviews, technical expertise, transparency, and enforcement. For example, the program is not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it has not formally assessed the potential risks posed by its current organizational structure. In addition, the program regularly performs reviews of laboratories' compliance with regulatory and program requirements, but these reviews may not target the activities that pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. Moreover, even though the program has taken steps to hire additional staff and enhance the technical expertise of its staff, workforce and training gaps remain. The program has increased transparency since 2016, but the information it shares is limited and there is no consensus about what additional information could be shared, given security concerns. Lastly, the Select Agent Program has authority to enforce compliance with program requirements, but is still working to address past concerns about the need for greater consistency and clarity in actions it takes in exercising this authority. Selected countries and regulatory sectors employ approaches to promote effective oversight that, in some cases, differ from those of the Select Agent Program. For example, Great Britain's Health and Safety Executive, whose mission is to protect worker and public health and safety and who oversees laboratories that work with pathogens, is an independent central government agency, according to officials. Other countries and regulatory sectors have regulatory bodies that are structurally independent from the entities they oversee, take a risk-based approach to performing reviews, rely on scientists and other laboratory personnel to have requisite technical expertise on the pathogens and activities in their laboratories, share incident information on their public websites, and have prosecutorial authority when incidents occur. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Select Agent Program (1) regularly assess the potential risks posed by its current structure and the effectiveness of its mechanisms to address them, (2) develop and implement a plan to identify which laboratory activities carry the highest biological safety and security risks and to respond to those risks by aligning inspections and other oversight efforts to target those activities, and (3) develop and implement a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs for the program as a whole. The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA) provided written comments agreeing with all of GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-173": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD maintains many weapon systems, including aircraft, ships, submarines, and strategic missiles. DOD has policies and organizations in place within weapon system management and depot maintenance to manage the sustainment of operational system software. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of software sustainment. This report examines the extent to which (1) DOD has policies and organizations in place to manage the sustainment of operational system software for weapon systems; (2) DOD and the military departments track costs to sustain weapon system software; and (3) DOD has addressed challenges securing necessary data rights to sustain weapon system software. GAO reviewed DOD policies and guidance, and interviewed DOD and military department officials. GAO also reviewed statutes governing DOD intellectual property, including technical data rights, computer software, and computer software documentation. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies and organizations in place within weapon system management and depot maintenance to manage the sustainment of operational system software. GAO found that DOD has policies for managing the life-cycle of weapon systems, including sustainment; and that DOD policy on depot maintenance and cost also considers weapon system software issues. Several organizations, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and DOD software centers, play key roles in overseeing and managing software sustainment. Software sustainment activities are conducted at numerous facilities, including military department software centers, weapon system program management offices, government laboratories or software integration laboratories, and contractor facilities. Additionally, while DOD has defined software sustainment and software maintenance activities synonymously, and it defines these functions as part of depot maintenance, GAO determined that the Navy categorizes and reports software sustainment differently. DOD's ability to track weapon system software sustainment costs is impeded by limitations in the collection of software data by both the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation and the military departments. CAPE oversees the primary cost data collection systems: the Cost and Software Data Reporting system and the military departments' Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs system. Further, CAPE has limitations in its cost and software data reporting system for data collected from DOD software centers. GAO also found that the military departments collect incomplete data on software sustainment costs in their Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs systems. DOD has begun taking actions to address these challenges. For example, DOD has commissioned studies to examine its access to and use of intellectual property, including technical data rights and proprietary restrictions. However, Congress has yet to receive two of those studies. Reporting on the findings and recommendations, as well as on any actions DOD may take in response to both studies, would provide insight and would highlight timely issues with technical data rights to keep Congress and DOD informed of government and industry concerns and enable them to use that knowledge in their decision making on weapon systems that may be in operation for decades to come. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) categorize and report its software sustainment costs, (2) take steps to prioritize obtaining complete cost and software data from DOD software centers, and (3) submit a report to Congress about a study on access to intellectual property for weapon system sustainment. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-633": "Why GAO Did This Study UI claimants receive nearly $30 billion in unemployment benefits in 2017, and reemployment services can help them find work more quickly and reduce UI program expenditures. DOL has a role in reemployment services, and has a role in identifying and referring UI claimants to reemployment services. GAO was asked to review DOL's efforts to identify and select UI claimants for reemployment services. This report examines (1) how selected states provide reemployment services to UI claimants, and (2) the extent to which DOL has identified and selected UI claimants for reemployment services. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DOL data on reemployment service spending; and interviewed DOL officials. What GAO Found Officials from all six of the Department of Labor's (DOL) selected states said they provide reemployment services designed to help UI claimants get back to work quickly. These services include assessing claimant skills and service needs, providing job search assistance and referrals, and conducting interviewing and resume workshops, among others. State officials said they may also refer claimants with more extensive needs to additional services, such as longer-term case management or retraining. Officials from all six selected states said they use technology and integrate resources from across federally funded workforce programs as strategies that help enhance efficiency and improve UI claimant customer experiences. Officials from all six selected states said they use technology and integrate resources from across federally funded workforce programs as strategies that help enhance efficiency and improve UI claimant customer experiences. Officials from all six selected states said their accounting systems did not generally track expenses by the UI claimant status of jobseekers served, and as a result, they could not isolate all reemployment service spending on UI claimants specifically. DOL officials said it would be burdensome for states to track and report workforce program expenditures on reemployment services provided to UI claimants specifically, as states have flexibility to use funds from multiple federal sources on services to both claimants and other jobseekers. DOL officials said it would be burdensome for states to track and report workforce program expenditures on reemployment services provided to UI claimants specifically, as states have flexibility to use funds from multiple federal sources on services to both claimants and other jobseekers. Past national studies and GAO's review of information from nine selected states indicate that the practices used by states to profile, or identify, UI claimants who are most likely to exhaust their benefits and need assistance returning to work differ. A 2007 DOL-sponsored study and a 2014 follow-up questionnaire to states found that, nationally, a large majority of states reported using statistical profiling systems, while a few states used a type of non-statistical profiling system known as a characteristic screen. The 2007 study also found that the performance of states' profiling systems varied widely. Specifically, while some systems predicted claimants' likelihood of exhaustion relatively well, others did not perform much better than random chance. Accepted statistical practices recommend that profiling systems be updated regularly, and DOL has recommended that states update their profiling systems every 2 to 4 years. However, more than half of states that responded to the 2014 questionnaire reported that they had not updated their systems since before 2008. DOL has an opportunity to use its new UI state self-assessment to systematically collect information that could inform its oversight of state profiling practices and technical assistance efforts. DOL officials said they view their primary role, related to profiling systems, as providing technical assistance; however, by law, DOL is also responsible for ensuring that states' profiling systems meet federal requirements. Further, GAO recommended in a 2007 report that DOL take a more active role in ensuring profiling system accuracy, and federal internal control standards state that agencies should obtain timely and relevant data to conduct effective monitoring. Without collecting more detailed and consistent profiling system information and having a clearer plan for how to use it, DOL's ability to conduct effective monitoring and respond to risks will continue to be limited. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOL (1) systematically collect sufficient information on state profiling systems, (2) develop a process to use information on state risks of poor profiling system performance to provide technical assistance to states that need to improve their systems, and (3) update agency guidance to ensure that it clearly informs states about the range of allowable profiling approaches. DOL agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

NASA's IT portfolio includes highly-specialized IT, which includes equipment, systems, and software that is used to acquire, store, retrieve, manipulate, and/or transmit data or information when the IT is embedded in a mission platform or provides a platform required for simulating, executing, or operating a mission. NASA's Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for developing and implementing approaches for executing the goals and outcomes in its strategic plan; ensuring that the agency's human resources possess the requisite knowledge and skills in IT and information resources management; maximizing the value of NASA IT investments through an investment management process; and leading and implementing the agency's IT security program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the effectiveness of NASA's approach to overseeing and managing IT. This report addresses the extent to which NASA has established and implemented leading IT management practices in strategic planning, workforce planning, governance, and cybersecurity. GAO compared NASA's IT management policies, procedures, and other documentation to criteria established by federal laws and leading practices. GAO also reviewed NASA's IT strategic plan and related planning guidance. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has not yet effectively established and implemented leading information technology (IT) management practices for strategic planning, workforce planning, governance, and cybersecurity. Specifically, the agency's IT strategic planning process is not yet fully documented and its IT strategic plan lacks key elements called for by leading practices. For example, the agency's strategic plan describes the responsibilities and accountability for IT resources across the agency. However, the agency has not fully documented the methods by which the agency defines its IT needs and develops strategies, systems, and capabilities to meet those needs. For example, the Office of the CIO is to perform a gap analysis to inform the development of NASA's roadmap that translates its IT needs and the strategies identified for meeting those needs into tactical plans. The tactical plans are to define how the strategic plan will be incrementally executed to achieve the longer term goals. However, the updated plan does not fully describe strategies NASA intends to use to achieve the desired results or descriptions of interdependencies within and across projects. Until NASA incorporates the key elements of a comprehensive IT strategic plan, it will lack critical information needed to align information resources with business strategies and investment decisions. NASA has not yet fully implemented IT workforce planning efforts. Specifically, the agency has not yet fully implemented five of the eight key IT workforce planning activities that GAO previously outlined. Specifically, the agency has not yet fully implemented the Office of the CIO's efforts to establish an effective IT governance structure. Specifically, the agency has not yet fully established that structure, documented improvements to its investment selection process, fully implemented investment oversight leading practices, or fully defined its policies and procedures for IT portfolio management. Similarly, although NASA continues cybersecurity improvement efforts, important elements of an effective cybersecurity approach have not been completed, including establishing a risk management strategy, an information security program plan, and updated policies and procedures. Until NASA leadership fully addresses these leading practices, its ability to overcome its longstanding weaknesses and ensure effective oversight and management of IT across the agency will remain limited. Moreover, NASA may be limited in its ability to strengthen its risk posture, including ensuring effective cybersecurity across partnerships with commercial entities, federal agencies, and other countries. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NASA (1) fully document its IT strategic planning process, including the methods by which the agency defines IT needs and develops strategies, systems, and capabilities to meet those needs; (2) update its IT strategic plan to fully describe strategies the agency intends to use to achieve desired results; (3) fully implement the eight key IT workforce planning activities; (4) fully implement the IT governance structure; (5) fully define policies and procedures for developing an effective portfolio management process; and (6) fully implement an effective approach to managing agency-wide cybersecurity risk.

    "gao_GAO-18-424": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's MWR programs provide a wide range of benefits for servicemembers and their families that ultimately help support military missions and readiness, both in times of war and peace. DOD's MWR programs are divided into three distinct program categories, two of which also have specific funding targets. GAO was asked to review the MWR programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which the services met the funding targets for MWR programs and the steps they are taking to address them, and (2) the extent to which DOD has established an oversight structure and performance measures for MWR programs. GAO reviewed DOD's MWR program guidance and funding targets, and interviewed DOD and service officials. What GAO Found The services did not consistently meet one of the two funding targets for Military Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs and are taking steps to address this, but the Department of Defense (DOD) has not comprehensively evaluated the funding targets to ensure they are appropriate. The services generally met the funding target for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 for MWR Category A mission-sustaining programs, but did not consistently meet the target for Category B programs that provide community support systems to servicemembers and their families during the same time period. Service officials said they are taking steps to meet the Category B target, such as restoring targeted levels of appropriated funding support in future budget planning. Data indicate that the services are getting closer to meeting the target. However, DOD has not comprehensively evaluated the funding targets, which were established more than 20 years ago, to ensure they currently are appropriate. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government recommend that management periodically review policies and procedures for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving an entity's objectives. Until DOD comprehensively evaluates the appropriateness of current funding targets and documents any changes made to the targets, DOD cannot be certain that the targets reflect the current operating environment and do not pose undue financial burden on the servicemembers. DOD has established an oversight structure and performance measures for MWR programs but has not developed measurable goals for determining whether MWR programs are cost-effective. Specifically, DOD Instruction 1015.10 assigns roles and responsibilities for oversight of MWR programs to the U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) Office of the U.S. Secretary of the Army (USD(P&R), the Secretaries of the military departments, and the Chiefs of the military services (i.e., the Chiefs of Staff for the Army and the Air Force, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps). In addition, the services' respective policies assign roles and responsibilities for MWR program oversight to the commander level. Lastly, the services' respective policies assign roles and responsibilities for MWR program oversight to the commander level. DOD and the services have performance measures to assess MWR programs, but these measures do not include measurable goals, which are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 55 activities that currently make up the MWR programs. Specifically, DOD identifies six broad performance measure categories in its instruction and, according to service officials, the services collect and use various types of information within these categories to periodically assess and adjust these activities, as appropriate. However, these measures do not include measurable goals, which are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 55 activities that currently make up the MWR programs. Specifically, DOD identifies six broad performance measure categories in its instruction and, according to service officials, the services collect and use various types of information within these categories to periodically assess and adjust these activities, as appropriate. In an effort to better evaluate MWR programs, the services have efforts underway that include the following to develop specific performance measures for their programs beyond the broad performance measures contained in DOD Instruction 1015.10. Until DOD develops performance measures that include measurable goals, it will be difficult for DOD and Congress to determine whether the individual activities and overall MWR programs are meeting desired outcomes in a cost-effective manner. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD comprehensively evaluate the funding targets for Category A and B MWR programs and document any changes made to the targets and the methodology used. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-285": "Why GAO Did This Study RHS provides rental assistance to low-income tenants in rural areas. RHS's program is intended to preserve affordable rental housing for low-income tenants. The program is administered by RHS and is intended to provide affordable rental housing to low-income tenants. The program is estimated to have about 14,000 properties with 427,000 rental units. The House report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 included a provision for GAO to review RHS's efforts to preserve rural rental housing. This report examines (1) RHS's efforts to estimate the dates that properties may exit the program due to mortgage maturity, and (2) steps RHS has taken to preserve the affordability of rural rental properties with maturing mortgages. GAO analyzed RHS data on mortgage maturity and exit dates, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed RHS officials. What GAO Found The Rural Housing Service (RHS) developed a tool to estimate the dates that properties may exit the rural rental housing program due to mortgage maturity, and better controls could improve data accuracy. RHS developed the Multi-Family Housing Property Preservation Tool (preservation tool), an electronic system designed to use data from two RHS databases to estimate mortgage maturity and property exit dates and to calculate new dates that may result from RHS's preservation efforts. Before introducing the preservation tool in 2016, RHS officials manually calculated exit dates for rural rental properties, a process that was subject to errors and inconsistencies due to properties with multiple mortgages and mortgages that could be prepaid. RHS officials said the preservation tool and the underlying data it uses are publicly accessible via the Internet and are intended to improve program transparency and help support the agency's preservation efforts. The tool enables RHS to look at trends in property exits across years and help determine when RHS will need to take preservation actions. As of April 2018, RHS had estimated property exit data available from 2017 to 2050, but not information on properties whose mortgages may mature in 2051 or beyond. RHS officials said that data will be released publically on its website when available. RHS's efforts to address properties with maturing mortgages have lacked a number of important steps that would better position the agency to preserve properties. First, RHS has not comprehensively planned and prepared for the larger number of potential property exits in future years, such as developing goals and metrics to assess the effectiveness of its preservation efforts and analyzing risks to its ability to preserve properties. Second, RHS has not analyzed or responded to risks involving staff management of maturing mortgages. For example, RHS has not analyzed or responded to risks involving staff management of maturing mortgages. Third, RHS has options to extend loan terms in order to continue rental assistance at properties but cannot continue providing rental assistance to tenants once the loan is paid off and the property exits RHS's affordable housing program. Some owners of properties with maturing mortgages may be open to continue offering rental assistance and agree to restrict the units to eligible low-income tenants after mortgage maturity. Further, some industry stakeholders cited that having the ability to extend existing rental assistance contracts after mortgage maturity would be useful in protecting tenants from rent increases or displacement. However, in some cases, property owners may not want to extend rental assistance contracts after mortgage maturity. Tenants living in these properties could be subject to rent increases or the risk of displacement. RHS also lacks the authority to continue rental assistance to properties with maturing mortgages and is limited in its ability to issue vouchers to tenants affected by property exits. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that RHS (1) establish additional controls to check the accuracy of all loan information entered into RHS information technology systems, (2) establish goals and measures for its rural rental housing preservation and rehabilitation efforts, (3) monitor the results of its preservation efforts, and (4) identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving its preservation goals. RHS agreed with all five recommendations but did not provide a formal agency comment letter.",
    "gao_GAO-19-3": "Why GAO Did This Study VA provides education benefits to eligible veterans and their beneficiaries enrolled in approved programs of education and training to help them afford postsecondary education. VA contracts with state agencies to help provide this school oversight. In fiscal year 2017, there were about 14,460 schools receiving VA education benefits for about 750,000 veterans and their beneficiaries across the country. GAO was asked to review VA's oversight of schools receiving these benefits. This report examines (1) the impact of limited funding on state agencies' oversight responsibilities, (2) the extent to which VA has assessed the risks of future state withdrawals, and (3) how VA and state agencies coordinate on oversight activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws and VA documents, interviewed VA and state agency officials, and reviewed VA and state agency documents. GAO also interviewed VA and state agency officials. What GAO Found Limited funding has affected state agencies' oversight responsibilities, leading state agencies to withdraw from this role, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not assessed how it will respond to future state withdrawals. VA recently changed its method of allocating funding to state agencies. VA officials said this new method was a significant improvement over the previous method they used, which was very limited. For example, VA officials said the prior funding method did not estimate how long it took state agencies to perform certain oversight activities. VA officials said this limitation was a key reason they decided to develop a new method. VA officials said the new method does not allocate sufficient funds. For example, VA officials said the new funding method does not properly estimate the time it takes state officials to travel to schools and carry out oversight functions, including conducting certain school approvals and providing schools with technical assistance and training. VA officials said the new funding method does not properly estimate the time it takes state officials to conduct certain school approvals and provide schools with technical assistance and training. VA officials said the new funding method does not properly estimate the time it takes state officials to travel to schools and carry out oversight functions, including conducting certain school approvals and providing schools with technical assistance and training. VA officials said the contractor would review the accuracy of the funding method's allowances for state agencies' salary, benefits, and travel costs, and its time estimates for states to conduct oversight activities to determine if changes are needed. VA has not assessed the risks of future state withdrawals, and without a contingency plan to address how VA will oversee additional schools, the agency runs the risk that if more states withdraw from their oversight responsibilities, then VA will be unprepared to oversee the schools in these states. VA and state agencies use certain risk factors to select schools for compliance surveys, and have taken steps toward a new oversight approach. For example, VA prioritizes schools based on risk factors such as rapid increases in veteran enrollment. VA officials said they have not yet used the risk factors cited in the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Colmery Act), which explicitly authorizes VA to use the state agencies for risk-based surveys and other oversight based on a school's level of risk. VA officials said they are exploring risk factors to consider in developing its compliance survey strategy for selecting schools in fiscal years 2019 to 2021. VA and state agencies coordinate to divide responsibility for who will conduct compliance surveys of schools receiving VA education benefits in a variety of ways, according to VA and state agency officials. VA officials said they collaborate with NASAA on providing training for state agency staff. VA officials said they are developing additional guidance for states on targeted school reviews. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA (1) complete efforts to identify and assess risks related to future withdrawals by state agencies in overseeing schools and (2) address these risks by preparing a contingency plan for how VA will oversee additional schools if more states choose not to renew their oversight contracts. VA agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-275T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal criminal justice system is a complex system of federal agencies that play key roles in determining the appropriateness of incarceration for offenders and inmates. BOP is responsible for the custody and care of federal inmates. BOP provides reentry services to inmates within federal prisons that may include drug treatment programs, education and vocational training, and psychology services. BOP also is to facilitate the transfer of inmates into RRCs, which provide assistance as inmates transition into communities, to include home confinement. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which federal collateral consequences can affect reentry and (2) the extent to which BOP has addressed GAO's recommendations related to federal collateral consequences for nonviolent drug convictions. This statement is based on GAO's September 2017 report on federal collateral consequences for nonviolent drug convictions (GAO-17-691). GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, interviewed federal criminal justice stakeholders, and reviewed relevant federal collateral consequences data. What GAO Found As of December 31, 2016, there were 641 collateral consequences in federal laws and regulations that can be imposed upon individuals with nonviolent drug convictions. GAO reported on collateral consequences contained in federal laws and regulations (i.e., federal collateral consequences) that can be imposed upon individuals with nonviolent drug convictions. GAO also reported on selected stakeholders' views. Most of the stakeholders that GAO interviewed\u201413 of 14\u2014said it was important for the federal government to take action to mitigate these collateral consequences. Thirteen stakeholders said that mitigating federal collateral consequences could potentially reduce the likelihood that individuals with NVDC reoffend. Similarly, 11 stakeholders said that mitigation could potentially increase the likelihood that individuals with NVDC successfully reenter the community after jail or prison. GAO reported in June 2015 and June 2016 that in part to help address challenges associated with overcrowding in certain institutions and related costs of incarceration, the Department of Justice (DOJ) had taken steps to reduce the prison population by pursuing initiatives to: use alternatives to incarceration for low-level nonviolent crimes; prioritize prosecutions to focus on serious cases; and commute, or reduce, sentences of qualified federal inmates. In these reports, GAO highlighted potential areas for continued oversight of these initiatives and made six recommendations. DOJ concurred with five of these recommendations and partially concurred with the other. As of December 2017, DOJ has implemented two of the six recommendations and has not fully addressed the remaining four. GAO reported in June 2015 that DOJ had taken steps to pursue alternatives to incarceration for certain offenders, but could improve data collection and efforts to measure outcomes resulting from the use of pretrial diversion alternatives. GAO recommended that DOJ (1) separately identify and track the different types of pretrial diversion programs, (2) provide guidance to its attorneys on the appropriate way to enter data, (3) identify, obtain, and track data on the outcomes and costs of pretrial diversion programs, and (4) develop performance measures to assess diversion program outcomes. DOJ partially concurred with the recommendation, and agreed to continually refine and enhance the indicators to improve their clarity and context. However, DOJ did not agree that establishing measurable targets for its indicators was appropriate. GAO recognized that it might not be appropriate to create targets for every indicator. Nevertheless, GAO maintained that measurable performance targets that are properly developed, communicated, and managed can aid Department leadership in the admittedly challenging task of assessing progress in the Smart on Crime initiative. GAO recommended that DOJ modify its Smart on Crime indicators to incorporate key elements of successful performance measurement systems. DOJ partially concurred with the recommendation, and agreed to continually refine and enhance the indicators to improve their clarity and context. However, DOJ did not agree that establishing measurable targets for its indicators was appropriate. GAO continues to believe that obtaining data on the costs and outcomes of pretrial diversion programs and establishing performance measures would gain multiple advantages in its ability to manage these programs and optimize their outcomes and cost implications. GAO also reported in June 2015 that DOJ had taken steps to evaluate its reentry programs. GAO recommended that BOP include, as part of its current evaluation plan, all 18 of BOP's national reentry programs, and prioritize its evaluations by considering factors such as resources required for conducting evaluations. BOP has continued to update the evaluation plan to reflect changes in priority. For example, the most recent plan, updated in July 2017, lists BOP's Mental Health Step Down Unit program as its top priority, with a target evaluation date of fiscal year 2018. According to BOP, this reflects the need for analysis of services for seriously mentally ill inmates. BOP has taken steps to assess costs of home",
    "gao_GAO-18-72": "Why GAO Did This Study The ISC requires executive departments and agencies to assess the physical security of their facilities. The ISC also requires agencies to monitor the performance of their physical security programs. GAO was asked to review the ISC's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures. This report examines (1) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the ISC Standard and (2) what management challenges, if any, selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results. GAO reviewed ISC standards and policies and interviewed agency officials. GAO also visited 13 selected facilities selected based on reported security levels and the number of countermeasures implemented. What GAO Found None of the four selected agencies' security assessment methodologies fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures. The ISC gives agencies some flexibility to design their own security-assessment methodologies for identifying necessary countermeasures as long as the chosen methodology adheres to fundamental principles of a sound risk-management methodology. Specifically, methodologies must: consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities, and assess three factors of risk (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) for each of the events. Furthermore, the ISC Standard requires executive departments and agencies to document decisions that deviate from the ISC Standard. Agencies' policies and methodologies reference the ISC Standard. However, none of the agencies' methodologies considered all of the undesirable events during assessments. For example, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) methodology did not fully align with the ISC Standard because it did not consider all of the undesirable events nor assess threat and consequence. CBP officials told GAO that as of January 2017, they began using an improved methodology to assess the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences for 30 of 33 undesirable events\u2014omitting three now identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC Standard. However, CBP has not yet updated its handbook to align with the ISC Standard, even though it started this effort over 3 years ago in December 2013. CBP officials did not provide a draft of its updated handbook, but they provided a plan with milestone dates for issuing the handbook by September 2018. CBP officials also told GAO that updates to the handbook may have to wait due to competing priorities, including efforts to address the backlog of assessments. Without updated policies and procedures requiring a methodology that adheres to the ISC Standard (including all 33 undesirable events now identified in the November 2016 revision to the ISC Standard), agencies may not collect the information needed to assess risk and determine priorities for improved security. This situation could hamper the agencies' ability to make informed resource allocation decisions or to recommend countermeasures commensurate to the needs at specific facilities. Without these key aspects of a comprehensive security program\u2014a methodology that meets the standard, policies, and procedures that incorporate that methodology; the ability to complete assessments on time; and information to perform monitoring\u2014agencies remain vulnerable to substantial security risks. GAO found that three of the four agencies (CBP, ARS, and the Forest Service) did not meet the ISC requirement to assess higher-level facilities at least once every 3 years. Officials reported various challenges including (1) assessments competing with other security activities, (2) an insufficient number of qualified staff to conduct assessments when compared to the number of facilities, or (3) not knowing of the required assessment schedule. Without balancing assessments with competing priorities, CBP's time frames for completing the assessments by the end of fiscal year 2018 may not be feasible and may also result in the agency's not addressing other important physical security responsibilities. GAO found that agencies' methods of collecting and storing security information had limitations that affected agency and facility officials' oversight of the physical security of their facilities. For example, CBP's handbook does not include requirements for data collection and analysis for monitoring physical-security program activities. Without including data collection and analysis requirements in its updated handbook, CBP may be unable to monitor the performance of its physical security program. Without a policy requiring ongoing monitoring of information\u2014an internal control activity\u2014agencies may be unable to assess the overall performance of their physical security program and take any necessary corrective actions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS, ARS, and the Forest Service (1) update their policies and procedures to require a methodology that fully aligns with the ISC Standard and (2) revise the assumptions used in the plan to address the assessment backlog to balance assessments with competing priorities, such as updating the policy manual and reviewing new construction design, to develop a feasible time frame for completing the assessment backlog.

    "gao_GAO-19-181": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is on a long-term, unsustainable fiscal path. GAO has previously reported that the federal government is spending far more money than it is collecting and is projected to do so going forward. Further, fiscal pressures have already begun to affect the management of the federal workforce, including decisions to hire, retain, train, contract, and collaborate. GAO was asked to review federal workforce management. This report addresses (1) key trends affecting federal work and workers, and (2) key talent management strategies agencies can employ to achieve a high-performing federal workforce, given those trends. GAO analyzed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Population Survey (CPS) and federal procurement data system \u2013 Next Generation, and interviewed federal Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO), federal employee and management group representatives, and private sector and foreign government officials. What GAO Found GAO identified key trends in agency operations and attitudes toward work that are affecting how federal work is done and, consequently, the skills and competencies that workers need to accomplish agency missions. These trends will require a federal workforce that can better adapt to and leverage constantly evolving technology and mission requirements. They will also require a federal workforce that can effectively collaborate and partner with workers both within and outside of the federal sector to achieve national policy objectives. For example, the federal workforce is relying on nonfederal partners to achieve policy goals, such as enumerating the population of the nation's population. GAO found that increasing diversity in the workforce may require new skills to manage a diverse workforce that seeks purpose, autonomy, and career mobility. GAO also identified shifts in employee attitudes toward work, which present recruiting opportunities and challenges for the federal government. Experts said that employees seek meaningful work (i.e., work that can influence the greater society), autonomy within the workplace (i.e., opportunities to develop creative and innovative solutions to complex problems), control over their work environment (i.e., they want to set a schedule and to work in a location that provides work-life balance), and career mobility, including opportunities for upward mobility (i.e., promotions) and lateral mobility (i.e., opportunities to rotate to different roles or projects within the same agency, a different agency, or outside of government). Given the changing demographic composition of the federal workforce and shifting attitudes toward work, GAO's analysis suggested that it may be important to select and train managers and supervisors who possess several leadership competencies. These competencies include fostering an inclusive workplace (valuing diversity and individual differences and leveraging these differences to achieve the agency's mission); team building (inspiring and fostering team commitment, spirit, pride, and trust); interpersonal skills (treating others with courtesy, sensitivity, and respect); and managing conflict (encouraging differing opinions to be expressed and resolving disagreements in a constructive manner). Such competencies can help managers and supervisors develop an agency culture where all employees feel valued, respected, engaged, and able to contribute toward an agency's mission. GAO identified actionable strategies that agencies may be able to use to effectively manage the future federal workforce in key talent management areas. These strategies are not an exhaustive list, collectively they suggest basic steps that agencies can take within existing authorities to position themselves to meet their talent needs. Since, in some cases, agencies already use these strategies, focused attention to leadership, culture, and sound management practices can help agencies prepare for the future workforce. For each strategy, GAO highlights some of the challenges agencies face, actions OPM can take to implement open, related recommendations from GAO's prior work, and practices that may help agencies implement the strategy. These practices are based on GAO's review of related reports, group interviews with federal Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO), and interviews with selected private organizations and foreign governments. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report. GAO has previously made recommendations to OPM to improve its management of the federal workforce. OPM has taken actions consistent with these recommendations.",

WMATA's rail and bus systems provide nearly a million passengers each day, and those passengers rely on WMATA for safe and reliable public transportation in the nation's capital and the surrounding areas. The federal, state, and local governments that fund WMATA expect WMATA to wisely use taxpayer funds to ensure the system is safe and reliable. GAO was asked to review WMATA's capital spending. This report examines (1) how WMATA expended its capital funding from fiscal years 2011 through 2017; (2) how WMATA's new capital planning process addresses weaknesses it identified in the previous process; and (3) WMATA's progress toward its track preventive maintenance goals and how the program aligns with leading program management practices. GAO reviewed WMATA documents and interviewed WMATA officials. GAO also compared WMATA's track preventive maintenance program to leading program management practices. What GAO Found The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) expended approximately $5.9 billion from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, primarily on replacing and maintaining its rail and bus fleets. WMATA expended the largest portion on assets related to the replacement, rehabilitation, and maintenance of its revenue vehicles (railcars, buses, and vans) and lesser amounts on other categories of assets.

    "gao_GAO-18-216": "Why GAO Did This Study The growth of e-commerce has accelerated the growth of counterfeit goods, which can pose risks to consumers. GAO was asked to review the challenges counterfeit goods pose to consumers. This report examines (1) what is known about counterfeit goods entering the United States and the challenges they present, (2) efforts U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have undertaken to enhance IPR enforcement and the extent to which they have assessed the results of these efforts, and (3) the extent to which CBP and ICE collaborate on IPR enforcement as well as ways in which they coordinate with the private sector in enforcing IPR. GAO reviewed CBP and ICE documents and interviewed CBP and ICE officials and representatives of rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites. GAO also conducted undercover purchases of consumer goods from third-party sellers on five popular e-commerce websites. What GAO Found The growth of e-commerce has contributed to a fundamental change in the market for counterfeit goods, according to CBP data and CBP officials. According to CBP data, the volume, value, and variety of counterfeit goods entering the United States increased in fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and counterfeit goods were increasingly imported in smaller express carrier or mail packages. The results of GAO's undercover purchases from third-party sellers indicate that counterfeit goods are available on a variety of popular e-commerce websites frequented by U.S. consumers. These changes present a number of challenges for U.S. agencies, consumers, and the private sector. For example, counterfeits can make it difficult for law enforcement officers to distinguish between legitimate and counterfeit goods, and counterfeiters may use a variety of methods to try to deceive law enforcement or evade detection. CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement, but CBP has not fully evaluated the results of its efforts. For example, CBP's metrics for tracking the overall effectiveness of its IPR enforcement have limitations. CBP has not systematically evaluated individual IPR enforcement activities, and CBP lacks a defined process for assessing port-led initiatives and sharing information about effective practices. CBP and ICE collaborate on IPR enforcement in ways that are generally consistent with selected key practices for interagency collaboration. For example, CBP and ICE define and articulate common outcomes, and they continue to define common outcomes through interagency efforts. CBP and ICE also coordinate with the private sector in a variety of ways. For example, CBP and ICE work with the private sector to encourage rights holders to record trademarks and copyrights, make determinations on the authenticity of goods, conduct training, and collaborate with e-commerce websites. However, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit the ability of rights holders and e-commerce websites to protect IPR. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CBP (1) evaluate the effectiveness of its IPR enforcement efforts and (2) assess what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with the private sector. CBP concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-253": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to limit operational deployments for individual service members, but has been less focused on the impact of total time away from home on personnel, commonly called perstempo. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 included a provision that required DOD to manage the number of days its service members are deployed. Section 991 of title 10 defines \u201cperstempo\u201d as the amount of time individual service members are engaged in their official duties at a location or under circumstances that make it infeasible for them to spend off-duty time in the housing in which they reside. The law also requires the Secretary of Defense or a delegated official to approve when service members exceed these thresholds, and requires DOD to establish a system for tracking and recording the number of deployment perstempo days for each member of the armed forces. Congress also required GAO to review perstempo. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD, service, and SOCOM policies identify specific and measurable thresholds on perstempo for individual service members and (2) the extent to which DOD and the services have reliable data to monitor perstempo. GAO reviewed DOD, service, and SOCOM policies and interviewed DOD, service, and SOCOM officials. What GAO Found DOD, service, and SOCOM policies vary in identifying specific and measurable thresholds on perstempo for individual service members. DOD policy focuses on time away for deployment, which is a part of perstempo but does not encompass the full range of activities that can take service members away from home. Specifically, a 2013 memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness states that individual service members should not be deployed longer than they are at their home station. However, the memorandum describes perstempo only in general terms\u2014stating that individual service members should not serve extended periods of time away from their homestation unless required by operational necessity. An official in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness acknowledged that the department has not defined DOD's perstempo threshold\u2014to encompass non-deployment events\u2014in specific and measurable terms and has not directed the services to establish such perstempo thresholds. The Navy and Special Operations Command have established perstempo thresholds in their policies and clarified which types of perstempo events apply to their thresholds. While these policies vary slightly, both the Navy and SOCOM describe in their policies the need to balance the pace of operations with the quality of life of their service members. The Army, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps are either not enforcing or have not established a specific and measurable perstempo threshold in their policies. As a result, each service has taken a slightly different approach. The Army, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps are either not enforcing or have not established a specific and measurable perstempo threshold in their policies. The Army, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps are either not enforcing or have not established a specific and measurable perstempo threshold in their policies. As a result, each service has taken a slightly different approach. DOD does not have reliable perstempo data, which limits its ability to effectively monitor perstempo across the department. In part due to the incompleteness of the perstempo data, an official within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness told GAO that the office cannot monitor perstempo even though section 136 of title 10 makes the office responsible for doing so. For example, a December 2017 Defense Manpower Data Center analysis indicated that perstempo data are missing records for at least 145,000 individuals that deployed in fiscal years 2014-2016. In addition, officials from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation told GAO that they attempted to analyze the effects of high rates of perstempo on unit readiness in 2016 but were unable to draw conclusions from the analysis because, among other things, the perstempo data were incomplete. Senior service officials also told GAO that the analysis had limited usefulness due to unreliable data. Incomplete and unreliable data have presented management problems, particularly for the Navy and the Special Operations Command as they have sought to manage the perstempo of their service members. For example, a Naval Personnel Command official who oversees the Navy's perstempo program told GAO that the 18,000 Navy personnel with more than 220 perstempo days in fiscal year 2016\u2014that GAO estimated using Defense Manpower Data Center data\u2014likely significantly understates the actual number of Navy personnel with high rates of perstempo.

Given the importance of grants as a tool to achieve federal objectives and the large outlays the federal government makes to fund them each year, effective training could help provide grants managers with the skills and competencies they need to better manage and oversee those dollars. GAO was asked to review grants training. This report examines (1) the extent to which OPM, OMB, and CFOC have taken steps to help provide grants training and (2) the extent to which selected agencies follow selected leading training practices. GAO reviewed OPM, OMB, and CFOC documents and interviewed OMB staff and officials from the selected agencies. GAO also compared current grants training practices at the selected agencies and sub-agencies with selected leading training practices. What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) have taken some steps to help provide grants training but have opportunities for further improvements. OPM, in consultation with OMB and the CFOC, developed a grants management competency model that includes general competencies such as accountability, writing, and computer skills. OPM also developed a grants job series, some grants training, and a career roadmap. However, OMB and CFOC have not widely publicized the roadmap and some sub-agencies GAO reviewed were unaware of it. Moreover, OMB and the CFOC are not collecting detailed data on users or feedback, which limits their ability to determine how useful these resources are to the federal grants workforce. The selected agencies varied in following selected leading training practices and they provided limited monitoring and oversight of their sub-agencies' grants training efforts. Without sufficient monitoring and oversight, the agencies cannot have reasonable assurance that their sub-agencies are sufficiently training their grants employees so they have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to properly manage, administer, and monitor the billions of dollars that the federal government spends on grants annually. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB (1) publicly publicize the Career Roadmap guidance among the 24 CFO agencies, (2) collect data metrics regularly on the Career Roadmap Builder online tool and Grants Training 101, and (3) obtain periodic feedback from federal agencies on the usefulness of these tools and any needed improvements. OMB and CFOC generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-68": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD uses Cobra Dane and other radar systems to track missile threats and classify missile threats. Cobra Dane is located at Shemya Island, Alaska, and is used to track missile threats from North Korea. The Air Force reported that Cobra Dane and LRDR can contribute to various missions, and GAO found that additional radar investments may reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane to meet mission requirements. GAO was asked to review the Cobra Dane and LRDR capabilities. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Air Force and MDA have shared and unique capabilities to support their respective missions, and (2) the extent to which the Air Force and MDA have shared and unique capabilities to support their respective missions. GAO reviewed the Air Force's report to Congress, and MDA's studies on Cobra Dane and LRDR. GAO also interviewed officials from the Air Force and MDA. What GAO Found The Air Force reported that Cobra Dane and Land Radar Defense (LRDR) can contribute to various missions, and GAO found that additional radar investments may reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane to meet mission requirements. The Air Force reported that Cobra Dane's location at Shemya Island allows it to track missile threats from North Korea earlier in their trajectories than LRDR would be able to track at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska. This is consistent with an MDA analysis that GAO reviewed that outlined additional advantages provided by Cobra Dane's location. For example, the Air Force reported that Cobra Dane's location would allow it to track missile threats earlier in their trajectories than LRDR would be able to track at Clear Air Force Station. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) completed studies that examined how LRDR could perform at various locations in Alaska, and the cost-effectiveness of constructing and sustaining the radar at those sites. MDA determined that locating LRDR at Clear Air Force Station would result in lower costs and enhanced system performance. DOD officials and documents GAO reviewed, including the Air Force's report to Congress, stated that other radar investments may reduce the department's reliance on Cobra Dane to meet mission requirements. For example, the Pacific Radar and Space Fence may reduce DOD's reliance on Cobra Dane to support ballistic missile defense and space surveillance, respectively. The Air Force reported that Cobra Dane met its requirement for operational availability\u2014i.e., the percentage of time that the radar system is able to meet its ballistic missile defense and space surveillance missions. Specifically, the Air Force report noted that Cobra Dane had been available an average of 91 percent of the time over a 2-year period (January 2016 through December 2017), which exceeded the 90 percent requirement for operational availability. Information that GAO reviewed from a more recent 2-year period (August 2016 through July 2018) showed that Cobra Dane's 2-year average for operational availability had declined to approximately 88 percent\u2014below the 90 percent requirement. Air Force officials stated that they can mitigate the effect on the ballistic missile defense mission if they know far enough in advance that Cobra Dane will not be operationally available\u2014such as during scheduled downtime. In its report to Congress, the Air Force projected that the Air Force and MDA would contribute total funding of $278.6 million based on their fiscal year 2019 budget plans for the operation and sustainment of Cobra Dane. According to the report, the Air Force and MDA plan to share funding for the operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar, and for three modernization projects that make up their sustainment plan for the radar. The Air Force also reported that the Air Force and MDA expedited Cobra Dane's mission system replacement project, but Air Force officials told GAO they face challenges in expediting the other two projects without compromising Cobra Dane's operational availability. For the mission system replacement, MDA requested additional funding in fiscal year 2018. Air Force and MDA officials told GAO that the additional funding they received allowed them to prioritize the mission system replacement and advance its timeline earlier that year. Air Force officials stated that they explored ways to expedite the two other projects as long as the amount of scheduled downtime is kept to acceptable levels. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD had no comments on the draft report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-155": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is responsible for preparing for and responding to threats from biological agents, including those that could harm human health and agricultural security. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Agriculture (USDA) to jointly develop a national biodefense strategy and associated implementation plan. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to develop a biodefense enterprise. This report examines (1) how federal agencies use threat awareness information to inform biodefense investments, and (2) the extent to which federal agencies share threat awareness information and the extent to which the biodefense strategy could help address fragmentation and complexity across the biodefense enterprise. GAO reviewed relevant federal documents and interviewed officials from key agencies, including DHS, DOD, HHS, USDA, and EPA. GAO also interviewed officials from the National Security Council and other offices within the executive office of the President. What GAO Found Key federal biodefense agencies rely on intelligence and global surveillance information, scientific study of disease agent characteristics, and analysis to better understand threats and help make decisions about biodefense investments. For example, DHS solicits information from the intelligence community about adversaries' capabilities to acquire, produce, reengineer, and disseminate a biological agent. DHS also conducts global disease surveillance to monitor threats from naturally occurring agents. For example, DHS conducts global disease surveillance on emerging infectious disease events to rapidly detect and monitor the characteristics of the disease event to determine whether and what kind of threat it poses to the U.S. population. Similarly, USDA conducts surveillance of foreign animal diseases and plant pests and pathogens to determine what threat they may pose to the U.S. agriculture industry. Agency officials in GAO's review described how their threat awareness activities help identify biological threat agents of concern and broad-based capability needs, which help guide their biodefense investment decisions. For example, agencies use threat information to determine which agents represent their highest priorities based on the potential of those agents to cause catastrophic harm. Officials from HHS and USDA also described properties or criteria against which they evaluate emerging or reemerging biological agents while conducting surveillance activities to determine whether they pose a serious threat, such as health effects after exposure to an agent or toxin, degree of contagiousness, economic and trade impact, and likely transmission routes. This threat assessment activity allows agencies to characterize and respond to urgent or real-time disease events, such as a Zika virus or an avian influenza outbreak. In addition, some agencies also reported using threat awareness information as part of efforts to identify and develop broader capabilities that would prepare them to respond to more than one agent. For example, DOD looks at what types of protective equipment are needed to complete the mission in the face of various threats, rather than starting with an individual threat agent. Officials from key federal agencies, including DHS, DOD, HHS, USDA, and EPA, identified multiple mechanisms that facilitated collaboration among government partners, including working groups and interagency agreements. However, opportunities remain to enhance threat awareness across the entire biodefense enterprise, leverage shared resources, and inform budgetary tradeoffs among various threats and agency programs. For example, the Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (BTRA) is a dedicated effort to identify and assess the risk of biological events that stem from nonstate actors intentionally seeking to harm U.S. interests using biological agents. By design, it is focused on the consequences and likelihood of terrorist events threatening human health, and does not assess the risk from other types of biological threats. However, there is no similar comprehensive mechanism in place that integrates threat awareness information for all sources of intentional biological threats, as well as naturally occurring events that could harm or destabilize U.S. interests by catastrophically affecting humans, animals, and plants. The absence of mechanisms to develop shared threat awareness across the full set of biological threats and use that information to identify opportunities for leveraging resources to mitigate risk across the enterprise is another example of the fragmentation and complexity GAO has previously identified. For example, the National Security Council's National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats is focused solely on outlining the federal government's approach to reducing the risks of biological weapons proliferation and terrorism, while the National Health Security Strategy authored by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) seeks to strengthen communities' abilities to protect against and respond to any incidents with negative health consequences. While these and other strategies, such as the National Strategy for Biosurveillance, address aspects of biodefense, no single strategy provides a comprehensive approach for the nation to prepare and plan for biological threats. In addition, there is no individual or entity with responsibility, authority, and accountability for overseeing the entire bio",
    "gao_GAO-18-294": "Why GAO Did This Study The HAVA included a number of provisions related to voting equipment and election administration activities, including requiring voting systems equipped for persons with disabilities at each polling place in federal elections. In March 2015, the EAC adopted a fourth iteration of the voluntary guidelines, referred to as VVSG 1.1, which clarified the guidelines to improve testability by testing laboratories, among other updates. The EAC, NIST, and the TGDC are in the process of developing the next iteration of the guidelines, VVSG 2.0, and these guidelines are expected to be issued in late summer 2018. GAO was asked to review voting equipment replacement and development. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What types of voting equipment did local election jurisdictions use for the 2016 general election, and what are jurisdiction perspectives on equipment use and performance? (2) What factors are considered when deciding whether to replace voting equipment and what approaches have selected jurisdictions taken to replace their equipment? (3) What are selected stakeholders' perspectives on how federal voting system guidelines affect the replacement and development of voting equipment, and what actions has the EAC taken to update the guidelines? GAO surveyed officials from 800 local election jurisdictions nationwide, surveyed election officials in five selected jurisdictions, and interviewed election officials and voting system vendors and subject matter experts. What GAO Found Local election jurisdictions primarily used two types of voting equipment, monitored such equipment, and were generally satisfied with its performance during the 2016 general election. According to GAO's survey of local election jurisdictions, jurisdictions monitored the performance of their predominant voting equipment through a variety of methods, such as equipment testing, performance measurement and tracking of malfunctions, and postelection audits and recounts. According to GAO's survey of local election jurisdictions, jurisdictions with approximately 96 percent of the population nationwide were very satisfied or generally satisfied with the performance of their predominant voting equipment during the 2016 general election. Specifically, GAO estimates that jurisdictions with 70 percent of the population nationwide were very satisfied with their voting equipment's performance and 26 percent were generally satisfied. Among jurisdictions that used different predominant types of equipment, jurisdictions that predominantly used optical/digital scan equipment that were more satisfied with their equipment's performance in 2016 had a larger estimated share of their population (20 percent) compared to jurisdictions that predominantly used direct recording electronic (DRE) equipment (4 percent). Local election jurisdictions and states consider multiple factors when deciding whether to replace voting equipment. After considering the factors, jurisdictions may decide to replace their equipment or continue using their existing equipment. The four key factors GAO identified are: (1) the need for voting equipment to meet federal, state, and local voting system standards and requirements; (2) the cost to acquire new equipment and availability of funding; (3) the ability to maintain equipment and receive timely vendor support; and (4) the overall performance and features of voting equipment. On the basis of GAO's survey of state election officials and interviews with officials from selected voting system vendors and subject matter experts\u2014representatives from nongovernmental research and other organizations involved in the field of election administration\u2014GAO found that these stakeholders have varying perspectives on how the current Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG 1.0 and VVSG 1.1) and their associated testing and certification processes facilitated or posed challenges to the replacement and development of voting equipment. The EAC, NIST, and the TGDC are in the process of developing the next iteration of the guidelines, VVSG 2.0, and these guidelines are expected to be issued in late summer 2018. Typically, a lag exists between when guidelines are issued and when they are used for testing and certification. EAC officials stated that it has generally taken about 18 months before the guidelines are ready for use for testing voting systems. This is due in part to the need for the voting system test laboratories to be reaccredited to test to the new voluntary guidelines by the EAC. EAC officials stated that it is unlikely that systems will be certified in time to be ready for use in the 2020 election. However, these officials noted that they are available to meet with vendors that would like to start developing equipment based on the new guidelines.

    "gao_GAO-19-36": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars each year to support its programs. The federal government also spends billions of dollars each year to support its programs. The federal government has a long-standing interest in ensuring that the federal government is spending its resources effectively. GAO was asked to review the use of spending authority and permanent appropriations. This report (1) identifies and analyzes federal budget accounts with spending authority and permanent appropriations, including the statutory references for the authorities, changes in the number of accounts and dollar amounts since fiscal year 1994, and other relevant information; and (2) describes whether the identified accounts are subject to or exempt from sequestration or subject to any special sequestration rules or limitations. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2015 budget authority data from fiscal years 1994 through 2015, the most recent year for which data were available when GAO began its work. GAO also analyzed the most recent data available from fiscal years 1995 through 2015, the most recent year for which data were available when GAO began its work. GAO also analyzed the most recent data available from fiscal years 1994 through 2015, the most recent year for which data were available when GAO began its work. What GAO Found The amount of spending authority and permanent appropriations reported government-wide grew 88 percent, from fiscal years 1994 through 2015 adjusted for inflation. Specifically, in fiscal year 2015, approximately $3.2 trillion was reported, compared with approximately $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 1994 ($1.7 trillion in fiscal year 2015 dollars). Although the total reported amount of spending authority and permanent appropriations increased over time, the changes for each authority type varied when comparing fiscal years 1994 to 2015. For example, the number of accounts with permanent appropriations and offsetting collections increased while contract and borrowing authority decreased. The majority of spending authority and permanent appropriations reported in fiscal year 2015 was concentrated in large agencies and budget accounts that fund entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported the highest use of spending authority and permanent appropriations. HHS also had the most accounts in the list of top 10 accounts in fiscal year 2015. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported the largest dollar amount of borrowing authority in most years, including fiscal years 1994, 2005, and 2015. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) were the two agencies that reported the largest percentages of dollar amounts of contract authority in fiscal years 1994 and 2015. The majority of agencies had offsetting collections authority. The majority of agencies had monetary credits or bartering, but none of these agencies reported using this authority from fiscal years 1995 through 2015. The majority of spending authority and permanent appropriations authorities were exempt from sequestration in fiscal year 2015. This is a reversal from fiscal year 1994, when the majority of spending authority and permanent appropriations authorities were subject to sequestration. This is a 20 percentage point increase since fiscal year 1994. Correspondingly, the proportion of spending authority and permanent appropriations authorities that were subject to sequestration decreased 35 percentage points from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 2015. The proportion of authorities that were partially subject to sequestration increased from 4 percent in fiscal year 1994 to 11 percent in 2015. Designations were not available for 11 percent of the authorities in GAO's inventory, due to methodological differences with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data.

    "gao_GAO-18-201": "Why GAO Did This Study VA provides medical care to nearly 9-million veterans annually. VA's medical centers are a critical component of VA's mission. VA's medical centers are located in a variety of locations, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and other facilities. GAO was asked to review VA's physical security at its medical centers. This report assesses (1) the extent that VA's policies for physical-security risk management reflect elements of federally established risk management standards and (2) VA's oversight of risk management of physical security at VHA facilities. GAO reviewed VA's risk management policies and procedures and interviewed VA officials. GAO also reviewed security data from nine medical centers selected based on geographic location, patient volume, and reported security incidents. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) risk management process does not fully reflect the standards established by the Interagency Security Committee (ISC). Although structured differently, GAO found that VA's process includes some elements of ISC's process but is missing other elements, gaps that could result in risks' not being fully assessed and appropriate countermeasures not being identified. For example, VA's policy does not require the documentation of risk acceptance, which is required by the ISC Standard. Without such documentation, VA cannot evaluate the effectiveness of its physical security programs being locally implemented across its facilities. VA does not assess the effectiveness of its risk management process. VA's Office of Security and Law Enforcement (OSLE) is responsible for overseeing the activities of each VHA medical center's police department. However, OSLE does not assess the quality of the assessments or whether they align with VA's policy requirements. For example, none of the vulnerability assessments GAO reviewed included documentation that all eight of VA's threat categories were reviewed, and at three locations, no threat categories were documented as reviewed in the assessments. Without a system-wide oversight strategy, VA cannot ensure that local physical security-decisions are based on actual risk, are appropriate to protect the facility, and are effective, or whether the variations or the security impact of them are important. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA review and revise its risk management policies for VHA facilities to ensure VA incorporates ISC standards, as appropriate. VA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-642T": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a long-standing interest in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. In February 2018, GAO reported that money laundering risk is high in the Southwest border region because of the high volume of cash transactions, the number of cross-border transactions, and foreign account holders. GAO also reported that the federal banking regulators have taken actions to address concerns about derisking. This statement discusses (1) the factors that affect the access to banking services for Southwest border customers, (2) the extent to which money transmitters serving selected countries reported losing access to banking services, and (3) the extent to which federal banking regulators have evaluated the extent to which derisking is occurring. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report, which examined (1) the factors that affect the access to banking services for Southwest border customers, (2) the extent to which money transmitters reported losing access to banking services, and (3) the extent to which federal banking regulators evaluated the extent to which derisking is occurring. GAO surveyed a nationally representative sample of banks and analyzed data on bank branch closures from 2013 through 2016. GAO also interviewed officials from Treasury, the federal banking regulators, and 12 money transmitters serving selected countries. What GAO Found Money laundering risk is high in the Southwest border region because of the high volume of cash transactions, the number of cross-border transactions, and foreign account holders. GAO's nationally representative survey found that many Southwest border banks may be engaging in derisking. Nationally, GAO's econometric analysis suggested that counties that were urban, younger, had higher income, or had higher money laundering-related risk were more likely to lose branches. Money laundering-related risks were likely to have been relatively more important drivers of branch closures in the Southwest border region. In March 2018, GAO found that money transmitters serving selected countries reported losing bank accounts or having restrictions placed on them, which some banks confirmed. As a result, some money transmitters relied on nonbanking channels, such as cash couriers, to transfer remittances. All 12 money transmitters GAO interviewed at the time reported losing some banking relationships in the last 10 years. Some money transmitters, including all 4 that served Somalia, said they relied on nonbanking channels, such as moving cash, to transfer funds, which increased their operational costs and exposure to risks. Treasury officials noted that despite information that some money transmitters have lost banking accounts, Treasury saw no evidence that the volume of remittances was falling or that costs of sending remittances were rising. In February 2018, GAO reported that the federal banking regulators and the federal banking regulators had taken actions to address concerns about derisking, including issuing guidance to banks and conducting some evaluations to assess the extent to which derisking is occurring. However, the actions regulators took to address concerns raised in their BSA/AML regulatory reviews were limited in scope (for example, they focused primarily on the burden resulting from the filing of currency-to-cash transactions (CTR) and securities-to-interest (SAR) filings) and had not evaluated all factors that may influence banks to derisk or close branches. Moreover, in March 2018 GAO found that Treasury could not assess the effects of money transmitters' loss of banking access on remittance flows because existing data did not allow Treasury to identify remittances transferred through banking and nonbanking channels. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the federal banking regulators and the Treasury jointly conduct a retrospective review of BSA/AML regulations and their implementation for banks, focusing on how banks' regulatory concerns may be influencing their willingness to provide services. In their written responses, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency agreed to leverage ongoing interagency work reviewing BSA/AML regulations and their implementation for banks to address GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-17-785": "Why GAO Did This Study The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires FCC to set regulations to assure the commercial availability of devices that access MVPD service (which currently are typically set-top boxes) by making them available from third parties unaffiliated with MVPDs. FCC's proposed rule would have allowed third party device manufacturers to create new devices and user interfaces\u2014the means through which users interact with a set-top box such as the menus, remote control, and methods of searching for programming\u2014to access MVPD services. The Act also required GAO to report on the status of competition in the video market. This report examines (1) the role of set-top boxes in delivering programming in an evolving video market, (2) the extent to which consumers are able to access video programming without subscribing to set-top boxes, and (3) the extent to which FCC has taken actions to increase consumer choice for set-top boxes. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed 11 experts and industry analysts and experts from a non-generalizable sample of 35 large MVPDs, a sample of 11 public interest organizations, and a non-generalizable sample of 11 large MVPDs. What GAO Found The Internet provides opportunities for consumers to access video programming without the need for a set-top box. These providers vary regarding the types of video services they offer: content aggregators (e.g., Netflix and Amazon) and direct to consumer (e.g., CBS All Access, HBONow, and Univision Now): These providers offer video on-demand through a subscription. They aggregate content from multiple sources and may provide their own content (e.g., Netflix's original series House of Cards) along with content from other programmers. There are also niche aggregators such as Indie Flix that provide specialized programming. There are also niche aggregators such as Indie Flix that provide specialized programming. Many subscribers to MVPDs are still reliant on at least one set-top box, usually leased from their provider, to access video programming. However, many MVPDs are also offering their video programming over the Internet and through alternative devices. For example, many MVPDs have started to allow consumers to access their subscription content via the Internet in and out of the home, on multiple devices, and when they want, for example: Many cable networks allow subscribers to MVPDs that carry that network to access live or on-demand content through an app or website specific to that network. MVPDs do not develop or control these apps and websites. However, many MVPDs have also developed their own apps allowing their subscribers to access a range of content. Despite growth in alternative devices and services, a Kagan report indicated that set-top boxes will still play an important role in the near future for accessing video programming from MVPDs as the industry replaces many current set-top boxes with higher end versions. FCC has conducted limited analysis of this issue to support its responsibilities under the Act to assure the commercial availability of devices that can access MVPD programming. Most selected stakeholders and industry experts GAO interviewed did not see a need for FCC to intervene in the set-top box market at this time, given the changes taking place that provide consumers with more choices for services and devices to access video programming. All 11 of the experts and analysts GAO interviewed said that the industry is moving away from set-top boxes on its own by providing content through other means and 9 of those 11 added that, as a result, there is no need for FCC regulatory intervention. Furthermore, only 8 of the 35 total industry stakeholders GAO interviewed stated that regulations are needed. These stakeholders pointed to the development of apps and devices beyond set-top boxes that consumers can use to access video content. However, representatives of all three public interest organizations GAO interviewed said that FCC regulations are still needed to promote consumer choice for devices. FCC has conducted some analysis related to these issues, but neither the proposed rule nor the recent video competition report reflect a comprehensive analysis looking at how these interrelated issues affect each other. In commenting on a draft of this report, FCC noted that the limited action of taking a not- yet-adopted proposal off circulation would not generally be an occasion for providing a regulatory impact analysis since such an action would have no regulatory effect. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FCC, as part of its future annual video competition reports, analyze how the ongoing evolution in the video programming market affects competition in the related market for set-top boxes and devices, including how this evolution affects the extent to which consumer choice for devices to access MVPD content remains a relevant aspect of the competitive environment. FCC agreed with GAO",
    "gao_GAO-18-493": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has been looking at ways to break up larger satellites into smaller ones or payloads after decades of building large, complex satellites to meet its space-based requirements. DOD has been using commercially hosted payloads to gain space-based capability. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of commercially hosted payloads. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has used commercially hosted payloads, (2) factors that have contributed to DOD's limited use of commercially hosted payloads, and (3) the extent to which DOD has information on commercially hosted payloads. GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed officials from DOD, the Air Force, and other government agencies. GAO also interviewed officials from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Department of Commerce. What GAO Found Since 2009, the Department of Defense (DOD) has used commercially hosted payloads\u2014a DOD payload on a commercial satellite\u2014three times and plans to conduct three more missions through 2022. DOD estimates that it has achieved cost savings of several hundred million dollars from these experimental payloads. DOD officials told GAO they expect to realize additional cost savings and be able to place capabilities on orbit more quickly from several hosted payload efforts that are planned or underway. Opportunities for additional hosted payload efforts may arise in the near term amid DOD planning for upcoming and follow-on space systems. Two factors have contributed to DOD's limited use of commercially hosted payloads. First, DOD officials identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with any given commercial host satellite. For example, most of the offices GAO spoke with cited size, weight, and power constraints, among others, as barriers to using hosted payloads. Second, while individual DOD offices have realized cost and schedule benefits, DOD as a whole has limited information on costs and benefits of hosted payloads. Further, the knowledge it has gathered is fragmented across the agency\u2014with multiple offices collecting piecemeal information on the use of hosted payloads. The limited knowledge and data on hosted payloads that is fragmented across the agency have contributed to resistance among space acquisition officials to adopting this approach. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD require programs using commercially hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",

GAO was asked to review the federal government's oversight of Internet privacy. This report examines (1) the benefits and concerns about the collection and use of consumers' data from the Internet, (2) the extent to which FTC and FCC oversee Internet privacy, and (3) the views of selected stakeholders on the effectiveness of current Internet privacy oversight. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed stakeholders from academia, industry, consumer advocacy groups, and FTC and FCC commissioners. GAO also interviewed stakeholders from FTC, FCC, and the Department of Commerce. What GAO Found The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have used different approaches to oversee Internet privacy. FTC uses its authority under section 5 of the FTC Act to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices. FTC also uses its authority under section 5 of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to police the collection and use of personal information from children by online services. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally said that there should be a balance between the freedom of companies to collect and use consumers' data needed to provide services and the necessity to protect consumers' privacy. Stakeholders also said that consumers lack an understanding of how their data are collected and used. FTC and FCC have used different approaches to oversee Internet privacy. FTC uses its authority under section 5 of the FTC Act to enforce the Fair Information Practice Principles, which are intended to balance privacy concerns with the need for using consumers' data. During the last decade, FTC filed 101 Internet privacy enforcement actions for practices that the agency alleged were unfair, deceptive, a violation of COPPA, a violation of a settlement agreement, or a combination of those reasons. Most of these actions pertained to first-time violations of the FTC Act for which FTC does not have the authority to levy civil penalties. In those cases where a party violated an FTC regulation or settlement agreement, however, FTC does have the authority to impose civil penalties. Selected stakeholders GAO interviewed provided various views on the effectiveness of current Internet privacy oversight and how it could be enhanced. Some stakeholders said that FTC's current approach is effective because the agency has expertise and experience in privacy issues and has the flexibility to take enforcement action on a case-by-case basis. In addition, a content provider said that FTC has taken enforcement actions against companies of various sizes in different sectors and has a powerful tool by being able to require companies to be audited by outside entities for up to 20 years. Stakeholders also said that regulations can provide clarity to industry and consumers, as well as fairness and flexibility in enforcement. Some stakeholders said that FTC's current approach is limited in part because it focuses on investigating and litigating cases that cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. Stakeholders and FTC identified potential actions to enhance Internet privacy oversight. For example, a key component of FTC's mission, as specified by the FTC Act, is to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive practices. Stakeholders said that a privacy statute could enhance Internet privacy oversight by, for example, clearly articulating to consumers, industry, and privacy enforcers what behaviors are prohibited, among other things. Stakeholders also said that a statute could enhance Internet privacy oversight by creating uniform standards for all players in the Internet ecosystem that is focused on the consumer rather than the regulatory legacy of the companies involved (regulations that apply to specific types of companies based on what they are or used to be, such as telecommunications carriers, cable companies, broadcasters, and mobile wireless providers). Stakeholders also said that there are advantages to overseeing Internet privacy with a statute that provides APA section 553 notice-and-comment rulemaking authority. FTC officials said that these additional steps add time and complexity to the rulemaking process. FTC officials said that these additional steps add time and complexity to the rulemaking process.

    "gao_GAO-18-446": "Why GAO Did This Study Reverse auctions are a tool for federal agencies to lower the price for which vendors are willing to sell a particular good or service. Agencies can use reverse auctions to order from various existing contract vehicles, such as indefinite delivery vehicles under which the government has already determined that a specific group of vendors is qualified to sell specific goods or services. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' use of reverse auctions. This report examines (1) federal agencies' use of reverse auctions between 2013 and 2017, (2) the extent to which selected agencies achieved benefits through reverse auctions, and (3) the extent to which selected agencies have insight into reverse auction fees. GAO reviewed policies and guidance from OFPP and at five agencies, and interviewed agency officials and representatives from reverse auction providers. GAO also reviewed agency-level guidance and data from FedBid, the largest reverse auction provider. What GAO Found GAO found the value of awarded reverse auctions decreased approximately 22 percent across the government between 2013 and 2017, from about $1.9 billion to about $1.5 billion. Although the number of auctions consistently decreased each year from 2013 to 2017, the dollar value of auctions increased after 2015, indicating that some individual reverse auctions have been for larger dollar values in the past couple of years. During this same period, the overall trend in federal contract obligations initially decreased from 2013 through 2015 and then increased overall through 2017\u2014from about $490 billion in 2013 to $508 billion in 2017. Hence, since 2013, contracts awarded through reverse auctions have consistently represented less than 0.5 percent of federal contract spending. GAO found that the dollar value of awarded reverse auctions varied from 2013 to 2017 across the six agencies GAO reviewed, with total reverse auction value greater in 2017 than in 2013 for half of the agencies (DHS, Navy, and State). The agencies GAO reviewed obtained iterative bidding, indicating enhanced competition between multiple vendors, in nearly three-quarters of reverse auctions, and contracting officials cited reduced administrative burden as another key benefit, but determining the actual amount of savings is challenging due to data issues. GAO found that reverse auctions that took place in 2016 resulted in contract awards that were an estimated $100 million below the government's pre-auction estimate, though the extent to which this figure represents actual savings is difficult to determine. GAO found that the agencies GAO reviewed did not maximize the potential benefits of reverse auctions\u2014competition and savings. GAO found that over one-third of reverse auctions in 2012 had no iterative bidding and that it was unclear whether savings calculated for reverse auctions were accurate because cost estimates developed before the auction may have been set too low or too high. In addition, almost half of the reverse auctions were used to obtain items from existing contracts. GAO found that agency guidance and contracting approaches lack sufficient information to ensure good business decisions and appropriate contract oversight. GAO found that agency contracting officials generally did not have a complete and accurate understanding of reverse auction fee structures. This hinders their ability to make informed decisions about when to use reverse auctions or which reverse auction platform to use for a specific procurement, potentially leading to paying more fees than necessary for reverse auctions for the level of service required. GAO found that none of the agency-level guidance GAO reviewed fully informed contracting officials about the availability of reverse auction providers and platforms and any applicable reverse auction fee structures, nor did the guidance ensure that contracting officials would compare the options available to them when considering whether to use reverse auctions. In addition, agencies that used the services of FedBid, the largest reverse auction provider, did not always draft sufficiently detailed fee arrangements to ensure that the agencies were knowledgeable about and could conduct oversight of FedBid's indirect fees. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Army assess why reverse auctions that are conducted using existing contract vehicles have only one bidder at higher rates than reverse auctions conducted on the open market; determine what factors indicate that conducting reverse auctions is appropriate when using existing contract vehicles; and provide this information to contracting officials so that they can consider it when developing their acquisition strategies. The Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), the Interior, and the Army concurred with 18 of the 21 recommendations GAO made, and did not concur with three.",
    "gao_GAO-19-130": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Education (Education) administers the Pell Grant Program, which provides grants to low-income undergraduate and certain post-baccalaureate students who are enrolled in a degree or certificate program (which can include vocational programs) and have federally-defined financial need. In the 2016-2017 school year, 59 Second Chance Pell schools disbursed approximately $35.6 million in Pell grants to a total of 8,769 individual students. GAO was asked to review the pilot. This report examines (1) the actions Education and other stakeholders took to implement the pilot, (2) the experiences that participating schools are having as they implement the pilot, and (3) what opportunities, if any, exist for improvement. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, analyzed Education data on the pilot, and interviewed officials from 12 schools selected to represent a range of characteristics, including location and size, as well as correctional partners. GAO also visited three prisons and one school campus. What GAO Found Education selected 64 schools to participate in the Second Chance Pell pilot, which allowed a limited number of students to receive Pell grants despite their incarceration. Education selected 64 schools for the pilot that varied along several characteristics, including location and size, as well as ensuring that selected schools did not have a history of compliance issues or other problems delivering federal student aid. Education hosted four webinars for officials at schools selected to participate in the pilot, and Education held the final webinar in August 2016 in collaboration with the Department of Justice. Education also hosted breakout sessions for Second Chance Pell schools at its annual Federal Student Aid Training Conference in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Across the pilot's first 2 years, 59 Second Chance Pell schools disbursed approximately $35.6 million in Pell grants to a total of 8,769 individual students. Officials from 12 of the 12 schools GAO interviewed reported experiencing some challenges implementing the pilot, but developed new approaches to address these challenges. For example, officials from 6 of the 12 schools said that some of their incarcerated applicants did not know or have access to their Social Security Number. The two most commonly-identified reasons applicants were initially ineligible for Pell grants were (1) some applicants had not registered with the Selective Service System, and (2) some had an existing federal student loan in default status. Schools and applicants faced challenges addressing these reasons. For example, officials from 7 of the 12 schools said that some applicants had trouble obtaining documentation from a parent or spouse. Officials from 8 of the 12 schools reported hiring additional staff or allocating more staff hours to help manage the increased administrative workload. Officials from 9 of the 12 schools said that limited technology in prisons, especially limited access to the Internet, presented a challenge. Officials from 9 of the 12 schools said that space and scheduling limitations in prisons also presented a challenge. Officials from 7 of the 12 schools said at least one incarcerated student was either transferred to another prison or was released during the pilot. Officials from 7 of the 12 schools said at least one incarcerated student was either transferred to another prison or was released during the pilot. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Education complete its evaluation of Second Chance Pell in order to report on the pilot's findings and conclusions reached. Education concurred with the recommendation.",

    "gao_GAO-19-72": "Why GAO Did This Study The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) requires federal agencies to report data on federal awards, such as contracts, grants, and loans. USAspending.gov is the website that provides federal spending information to the public. The DATA Act also requires GAO to review implementation of the act. This report (1) identifies key practices for transparently reporting government data on a centralized website, and (2) evaluates the extent to which USAspending.gov is consistent with these key practices, as well as existing standards for federal websites. GAO analyzed literature and interviewed open data experts and good governance groups. GAO also reviewed USAspending.gov against criteria for federal websites and open data programs. What GAO Found GAO identified five key practices that managers of open government data programs can consider to help ensure the transparent presentation of their data. GAO identified these key practices by systematically evaluating and synthesizing information from literature on open data as well as interviews with open data experts and good governance groups. These key practices and key actions are intended to be used in tandem with requirements for federal government websites and open data programs, such as relevant laws and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. These key practices and actions are not intended to replace or supersede any applicable requirements. When considering an individual open government data program, some key practices and actions may be more relevant than others because the purpose and characteristics of open government data programs may vary. In addition, while this report focuses on the presentation of open government data, open data practitioners should also consider other elements\u2014including data quality and data governance\u2014to ensure that the public has access to high-quality information. USAspending.gov aligns with the key practices of providing free and unrestricted data and engaging with users. However, Treasury does not fully describe the data and two data elements required by law are not searchable. In addition, Treasury lacks a process to ensure all pages on the website are secure, consistent with federal requirements. Spending data are open by default and sensitive information is protected. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) requires the website displaying the data that agencies must provide to be accessible to the public at no cost. In response to requirements in FFATA, as amended by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), in May 2014, OMB and Treasury developed standard definitions for data elements for agencies to report, and Treasury displays these open data on USAspending.gov. In addition, USAspending.gov provides users with detailed and disaggregated data. However, Treasury does not fully describe the data and two data elements required by law are not searchable. In addition, Treasury lacks a process to ensure all pages on the website are secure, consistent with federal requirements. Without an effective control process in place, Treasury does not have assurance that any new pages that may be added to USAspending.gov will conform to federal information security requirements. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Treasury (1) ensure all pages on USAspending.gov use the secure HTTPS protocol, (2) fully comply with OMB's requirements by providing metadata in a single location that are easy to find on the USAspending.gov website, (3) fully comply with OMB's requirements by communicating licensing information on USAspending.gov, and (4) fully comply with OMB's requirements by providing users with easy access to structured metadata.

    "gao_GAO-19-71": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars annually on document services, including printing and reproduction. DOD's DLA Document Services provides printing and reproduction services to DOD and the military services. GAO was asked to review DOD's document services. This report examines (1) the progress DOD has made in achieving efficiencies in its document services and opportunities, if any, for further efficiencies, and (2) the extent to which DOD reports accurate financial information about its document services to key stakeholders. GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also analyzed DOD's budget justification materials for printing and reproduction activities and the military services' annual budget requests. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps toward achieving efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services, taking steps to reduce the cost and number of office print devices, and increasing its use of electronic content management. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. DOD has taken steps toward achieving efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services, taking steps to reduce the cost and number of office print devices, and increasing its use of electronic content management. However, GAO identified four areas where further gains may be possible: better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. DOD has not implemented a department-wide approach for acquiring print devices, and DOD components use at least four different sources to acquire them, with costs that vary widely for similar devices. For example, as one of its services, DLA Document Services provides print devices, as well as associated maintenance and supplies, to DOD components. The Army and Air Force have each established their own service-wide contracts for obtaining print devices and have mandated their use, while the Department of the Navy has mandated that the Navy and Marine Corps use DLA Document Services to obtain these devices. Military service officials told GAO that consolidating purchases with a single service-wide source reduces the cost of these devices by taking advantage of economies of scale, because vendors can offer better pricing for larger numbers of customer orders. GAO's review found that DOD has not implemented a department-wide approach for acquiring print devices, and DOD components use at least four different sources to acquire them, with costs that vary widely for similar devices. For example, as one of its services, DLA Document Services provides print devices, as well as associated maintenance and supplies, to DOD components. The Army and Air Force have each established their own service-wide contracts for obtaining print devices and have mandated their use, while the Department of the Navy has mandated that the Navy and Marine Corps use DLA Document Services to obtain these devices. DOD has set goals intended to reduce the number of print devices and realize tens of millions of dollars in savings each year, but it has not demonstrated that it has achieved these savings, because of limitations in internal controls. Additional efforts aimed at collecting and analyzing information to examine areas for further consolidation of DLA Document Services' mission specialty locations might provide DOD with additional cost savings. DOD's annual budget requests do not provide distinct information on two areas of its document services mission\u2014print device procurement and electronic content management. For example, the budget materials for printing and reproduction omit obligations for print device procurement and electronic content management. By providing more accurate costs for its document services activities, DOD would ensure that Congress and departmental leaders have the insight needed to make informed decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD assess whether DLA Document Services' single manager role for printing and reproduction provides the best value to the government and whether any additional efficiencies are possible, and use the results of that assessment to inform the revision of DOD Instruction 5330.03. DOD partially concurred with the recommendations, stating that it has not evaluated options to report more accurate funding information on its document services.",
    "gao_GAO-19-138": "Why GAO Did This Study Physical access control systems are used to manage access to controlled areas, such as a building or a room in a building. Physical access control systems can be electronically connected in different ways, including within a given building or across an agency or department. OMB and GSA have taken steps to help agencies implement GSA-approved physical access control systems. GAO was asked to review the implementation of physical access control systems. This report examines (1) the steps OMB and GSA have taken to fulfill their government-wide responsibilities related to physical access control system implementation requirements and (2) challenges selected federal agencies face in adhering to federal physical access control system requirements. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from OMB and GSA; and reviewed documents from five selected agencies. GAO also interviewed officials from physical access control system manufacturers, integrators, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have taken steps to help agencies procure and implement secure and interoperable GSA-approved physical access control systems across the federal government. For example, OMB has issued guidance to clarify agency responsibility to use GSA's Approved Products List. GSA has also taken actions to improve guidance and facilitate the implementation of physical access control systems. For example, GSA has developed a list of system integrators that can be used to install physical access control systems that have been approved for the Approved Products List. However, GAO found that neither OMB nor GSA currently collect data on agency efforts to implement physical access control system requirements, including use of the Approved Products List. This is significant because GAO's interviews with physical access control system manufacturers, integrators, and selected agencies indicate that government-wide implementation of physical access control systems may be limited and raises questions about government-wide progress. Officials from four of the five selected agencies GAO reviewed told GAO that, since 2013, when physical access control system end-to-end testing requirements began, they had only purchased GSA-approved physical access control system equipment for a limited number of their facilities. Moreover, they said that where purchasing occurred, it was sometimes for physical access control systems that required replacement because they were nearing the end of their useful life. Officials from five selected agencies are illustrative of the oversight difficulties that OMB faces because it does not have baseline information about agencies' efforts to implement physical access control systems, including implementation of GSA-approved systems. This lack of information hampers OMB's efforts to (1) meaningfully track and monitor agencies' adherence to physical access control system requirements, or (2) provide an incentive for agencies to be more accountable with regard to where their physical access control systems stand in terms of their ability to prevent security breaches. Federal internal-control standards state that establishing a baseline level of information on adherence to physical access control system requirements prevents OMB from gauging the level of progress being made by agencies. Likewise, an increased understanding of the extent and nature of the challenges that federal agencies may face as they implement physical access control systems may help enhance adherence to physical access control system requirements. This two-pronged approach, the establishment of a baseline and a better understanding of the challenges agencies face as they implement physical access control systems, could prove beneficial in achieving the vision of secure, interoperable systems across departments and agencies. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB determine a government-wide baseline level of progress in meeting physical access control system requirements, including implementation of GSA-approved systems, and monitor progress in meeting these requirements. OMB staff agreed with GAO's recommendation.",

This report examines (1) how BOP has used its authority to pay retention incentives; (2) what internal controls are in place for the use of retention incentives; and (3) the extent to which BOP plans for and evaluates the use of retention incentives. GAO reviewed BOP's fiscal year 2016 retention incentive expenditures and interviewed BOP officials. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable random sample of 40 application packet case files for retention incentives awarded from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. What GAO Found The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) spent more than 97 percent of its total retention incentive expenditures on employees at four California institutions and for medical professionals nationwide. BOP officials told GAO that these institutions were consistently understaffed as a result of their lower salaries in comparison to salaries offered by other BOP institutions in California metropolitan areas. BOP has a number of internal controls in place to ensure that retention incentive applications and approvals meet BOP and other requirements. BOP officials told GAO that these controls are part of a multilayered application and review process that begins at the institution and culminates at BOP's Central Office. GAO's review of a random sample of 40 application packet case files for retention incentives awarded from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 found that they all generally incorporated the internal controls described by officials. BOP officials stated that they conduct periodic audits and reviews of its human capital activities and related internal controls, to ensure that retention incentives are being used appropriately. BOP officials stated that planning for human capital needs is conducted at institutions during quarterly workforce utilization meetings or manpower salary meetings. During these meetings, executive staff at the institution discuss the current state of the institution's workforce. BOP officials stated that they anticipate that the strategic human capital operating plan will be a supplement to their workforce utilization meetings and that an agency-wide plan will provide a set of strategies for all institutions to consider. However, BOP could not provide documentation of the project beginning or whether it would include a strategic approach specific to retention incentives. Including retention incentives in BOP's strategic human capital operating plan would create a roadmap for the agency and the institutions to use to move from being reactive in their current workforce needs\u2014for example, awarding retention incentives on an ad hoc basis when funds are available\u2014to being strategic in how retention incentives are used and to ensure that these and other flexibilities help the agency achieve its long-term workforce goals.

DOE uses contractors to manage and operate its facilities, including subcontracts, which are contracts under which the government reimburses a contractor for allowable costs incurred, to the extent prescribed by the contract. GAO was asked to review DOE's oversight of contractors' subcontract management. This report examines (1) the entities that participated in DOE's 24 largest prime contracts, the extent to which they subcontracted their work, and the entities that participated in those subcontracts during fiscal year 2016, and (2) the extent to which DOE ensures that contractors conduct required subcontract audits and that contractors are effectively overseeing subcontracts.

What GAO Found In fiscal year 2016, 28 entities were party to the Department of Energy's (DOE) 24 largest prime contracts. Specifically, DOE awarded 15 prime contracts to contractors composed of groups of two to five entities and awarded the remaining nine of the 24 prime contracts in GAO's selection to contractors composed of a single entity.

    "gao_GAO-19-198": "Why GAO Did This Study DODIG is responsible for investigating misconduct and whistleblower reprisal complaints. DODIG and the military service IGs share responsibility for investigating misconduct and whistleblower reprisal complaints. GAO was asked to review DODIG and the military service IGs' performance. This report examines the extent to which (1) DODIG and the military service IGs met and took steps to achieve key fiscal year 2018 timeliness and quality goals related to the handling of whistleblower complaints, and (2) DODIG and the military service IGs have established processes to protect the confidentiality of whistleblowers. GAO reviewed DODIG and military service IG timeliness and quality goals, and interviewed DODIG and military service IG officials. GAO also surveyed 86 DODIG employees to assess whether, in their view, confidentiality processes are being implemented in accordance with guidance and standards, identify potential confidentiality violations, and gather perceptions on the integrity of the internal process for reporting misconduct. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Inspector General (DODIG) and the military service offices of inspector general (IG) met some, but not all, fiscal year 2018 timeliness and quality goals related to the handling of whistleblower complaints. DODIG met some but not all internal timeliness goals for fiscal year 2018 related to the intake and referral of whistleblower allegations, as well as the oversight of DOD component investigations. DODIG also did not meet internal goals related to the timeliness of senior official misconduct investigations or internal and statutory goals related to the timeliness of reprisal investigations. DODIG and the military service IGs have implemented and planned various initiatives to improve the timeliness of their processing of senior official misconduct and reprisal complaints. While these initiatives are positive steps, given that the performance of some measures is far below the goals, additional efforts could be made to improve performance against unmet timeliness goals\u2014including those pertaining to senior official misconduct investigations conducted by the military service IGs, military service IG notifications made to DODIG, and military service IG intake reviews for reprisal cases. Additionally, DODIG and the military service IGs do not agree on the timeframes prescribed by DOD policy for military service IGs to notify DODIG of the receipt of a complaint, thereby complicating achievement of these goals. Until DODIG develops guidance that incorporates procedures to protect confidentiality and documents how to maintain whistleblower confidentiality throughout the referral process, it will lack reasonable assurance that its process for investigating internal misconduct allegations can fully protect the confidentiality of whistleblowers. DODIG and the military service IGs do not experience significant challenges in accessing sensitive or classified information necessary to handle whistleblower complaints, according to cognizant IG officials. Such information includes documentary evidence or witness statements. Similarly, 79 of 86 (92 percent) DODIG respondents to GAO's survey reported that they are generally able to access all types of unclassified information necessary to perform the duties of their position, while 82 of 86 (95 percent) respondents stated that they are either able to access classified information as necessary or do not require access to classified information. DODIG and the military service IGs are following DOD's IT risk management process, which involves the assessment of and authorization to operate IT used to manage DOD information\u2014including sensitive but unclassified whistleblower information. However, DODIG has not developed sufficient system controls needed to restrict access across the three DODIG directorates that are principally responsible for handling whistleblower information. For example, a DODIG employee in either the senior officials or reprisal investigations directorates can access Hotline records in the Defense Case Activity Tracking System (D-CATS) that the employee does not have a need to access, with the exception of cases specifically restricted by the DOD Hotline to prevent unauthorized access. DODIG has identified instances in which sensitive but unclassified whistleblower information in the DODIG Administrative Investigations directorate whistleblower case management system and document repository was accessible to DODIG personnel who did not have a need to know this information. DODIG has taken remedial actions and identified additional recommended steps, including developing enhanced user management procedures and internal controls related to establishing user accounts, reconciling current user permissions, and controlling access to restricted records. However, DODIG's process does not include steps to test document repository permissions after case management system updates, which were determined by DODIG to be the cause of some permission issues. Without considering interim actions to address the lack of cross-directorate access controls, DODIG may be unable to sufficiently mitigate security risks while D-CATS is developed",
    "gao_GAO-18-243": "Why GAO Did This Study The UN has carried out 71 peacekeeping operations since 1948, and has 16 active UN peacekeeping operations worldwide. The UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) was established following escalating sectarian violence in CAR that resulted in the destruction of state institutions, thousands of deaths, and 2.5 million people\u2014more than half of CAR's entire population\u2014in need of humanitarian aid. The UN Security Council Resolution 2149 established MINUSCA following escalating sectarian violence in CAR that resulted in the destruction of state institutions, thousands of deaths, and 2.5 million people\u2014more than half of CAR's entire population\u2014in need of humanitarian aid, according to a UN report. The UN reported in June 2017 that it maintained 95,544 uniformed peacekeepers, 5,004 international civilians, 10,149 local civilians, and 1,597 UN volunteers in support of its operations around the world. GAO was asked to review the costs of UN peacekeeping operations. This report (1) compares the reported costs of a specific UN peacekeeping operation to the estimated costs of a hypothetical, comparable operation implemented by the United States; (2) identifies factors that affect cost differences; and (3) identifies stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. GAO analyzed UN budget and expenditure data covering the initial start-up period (April 2014 to June 2014) and the first 3 UN fiscal years (July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017). GAO also compared the U.S. cost estimate to UN costs for MINUSCA, which included both military and civilian components, with estimated costs for a hypothetical U.S. operation with a similar level of military and civilian personnel. GAO also interviewed U.S. and UN officials regarding U.S. and UN standards and policies that explain differences between MINUSCA costs and the estimated costs of a U.S. operation. What GAO Found Based on data and other input from the United Nations (UN), Department of Defense (DOD), and State, GAO estimates that it would cost the United States more than twice as much as it would cost the UN to implement a hypothetical operation comparable to MINUSCA, the ongoing UN operation in the Central African Republic (CAR). GAO's comparison covers the time from which MINUSCA was established in April 2014 through the end of UN fiscal year 2017, which ended on June 30, 2017\u2014a total of 3 years and 3 months, the first 39 months of MINUSCA. Over this time period, UN costs for MINUSCA totaled approximately $2.4 billion. Using roughly the same basic parameters for MINUSCA, including similar deployment levels of military and civilian personnel over the same time period, in consultation with DOD and State officials, GAO estimates that a comparable, hypothetical U.S. operation would likely cost nearly $5.7 billion, more than twice the UN cost for MINUSCA. This estimate does not include, among other things, the cost for State diplomatic security and office space for civilian staff, the inclusion of which could further increase the total estimated U.S. cost for such an operation. Various factors contribute to the differences in costs between actual UN expenditures for MINUSCA from April 10, 2014 through June 30, 2017\u2014the first 39 months of MINUSCA\u2014and a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation over the same time period, including disparities in the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems. These disparities reflect operational, structural, and doctrinal differences in the way the United States likely would undertake a hypothetical, comparable operation, should such an operation be deemed in the U.S. national interest. UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations have various relative strengths, according to U.S. and UN officials GAO met with. Relative strengths of UN peacekeeping operations include international and local acceptance, access to global expertise, and the ability to leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks, according to these officials. Relative strengths of U.S. peacekeeping operations would include faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capabilities, according to U.S. and UN officials.",
    "gao_GAO-18-343": "Why GAO Did This Study ICE operates the largest immigration detention system in the world, with more than 50,000 detainees in its custody. ICE uses two key variables\u2014the bed rate and the ADP\u2014when formulating its budget request. GAO was asked to review ICE's budget process. This report examines (1) how ICE calculates its budget request and how it uses its projections, and (2) the extent to which ICE's cost estimate for immigration detention resources meets best practices. GAO reviewed ICE's budget formulation guidance and ADP projections, and interviewed ICE officials. What GAO Found U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) follows budget formulation guidance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and uses two key variables\u2014the bed rate and the ADP\u2014when formulating its budget request. ICE calculates the total amount requested for ICE's immigration detention costs using its formula. ICE's budget request is based on DHS guidance, and uses two key variables\u2014the bed rate and the ADP\u2014when formulating its budget request. ICE calculates the projected adult bed rate by tracking obligations and expenditures in four categories\u2014bed/guard costs, health care, other direct costs, and service-wide costs, also known as indirect costs. ICE calculates the projected bed rate by using its own inflation rate based on the escalation of detention costs instead of a standard inflation rate provided by the Office of Management and Budget or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). However, ICE did not provide documentation to support its rationale for not using the inflation factor. ICE's adult bed rate projections underestimated the actual bed rate from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. Specifically, ICE underestimated the bed rate by $2.16 in fiscal year 2014, by $8.08 in fiscal year 2015, by $5.42 in fiscal year 2016, and by $0.31 in fiscal year 2017 (see figure). For illustrative purposes, underestimating the bed rate by $5 per day, assuming an ADP of 34,000, yields a more than $62 million underestimation in the detention budget request. ICE uses historical costs to develop its projected adult bed rate projections, but could improve projections. ICE uses its own inflation rate based on the escalation of detention costs instead of a standard inflation rate provided by the Office of Management and Budget or DHS, but did not provide documentation of its rationale. ICE officials stated that historical costs more accurately reflect potential increases, but did not provide documentation to support that rationale. ICE officials stated that historical costs more accurately reflect potential increases, but did not provide documentation to support that rationale. By basing its detention cost estimates on quality information, ICE would help ensure they are useful to Congress for making resource allocation decisions. ICE reported using ADP figures that are based on policy decisions, but it is unclear if the ADP figures were based on statistical analysis. Further, ICE did not provide documentation on how it calculated the final ADP numbers used in its budget requests. For example, the fiscal year 2018 budget justification includes a projected adult bed rate of 48,879 adults, a 63 percent increase over the fiscal year 2017 projected adult ADP (29,953) and a 49 percent increase over the fiscal year 2016 actual adult ADP (32,770). Although ICE provided a general explanation of various factors that influence ADP, the agency did not provide documentation quantifying the effect of these factors nor the calculations or methodology used to arrive at the 48,879 figure. ICE officials stated that ADP is difficult to forecast given the unpredictable nature of events such as natural disasters, gang activity, or political upheaval in another part of the world, which may lead to an unanticipated increase in migration.

    "gao_GAO-18-233": "Why GAO Did This Study Emergency preparedness is a shared responsibility for the higher education community. GAO was asked to review emergency preparedness efforts at colleges. This report examines (1) how selected colleges prepare for emergencies, (2) the resources federal agencies provide to help prepare for emergencies, and (3) the extent to which selected colleges and stakeholders have awareness of federal resources. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed federal agency officials; and analyzed federal websites and federal websites. GAO also interviewed emergency preparedness associations and emergency managers at 18 selected colleges. What GAO Found Selected colleges prepare for emergencies by involving the campus community, developing and publicizing emergency preparedness plans, and partnering with local and state agencies. College offices responsible for emergency preparedness efforts and the number of staff assigned to such efforts varied among the 18 selected colleges. About half of the officials responsible for emergency preparedness efforts at the 18 selected colleges also spent time on other types of responsibilities that were not specific to emergency preparedness, such as health and safety issues. College officials GAO interviewed described preparations for a range of emergencies and used a variety of tools to communicate and practice their plans. Officials at the 18 selected colleges most commonly described using college websites, text messages, or mass email alerts to communicate emergency preparedness information to the campus community. Officials at most of the selected colleges said they relied on either their local or state partners, or both, for advice, questions, or to obtain resources for emergency preparedness. These partners were also the first responders for colleges experiencing emergencies and may include local and state police and fire departments, hospitals, and emergency management offices. Officials at most of the selected colleges said they worked with partners in their local community, such as police, fire, and emergency management departments or local public health agencies, in preparing for emergencies.

Officials at most of the selected colleges said they worked with state law enforcement entities to, for example, obtain information about emerging threats, or involve state officials in drills and exercises to practice their colleges' emergency plans. Officials at the selected colleges cited mixed levels of awareness regarding federal resources on emergency preparedness developed specifically for them. Officials from the selected colleges cited mixed levels of awareness regarding federal resources on emergency preparedness developed specifically for them. For example, officials at all 18 colleges said they were aware of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Incident Management System (NIMS) resources focused on general emergency preparedness, such as NIMS. However, GAO found that college emergency managers were less frequently aware of college-specific resources produced or funded by Education, DOJ, and others. Specifically, college emergency managers at almost half of the selected schools said that they were unaware of each of the following key resources: the 2013 Guide for Developing High-Quality Emergency Operations Plans, the NCCPS website, or Education's Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center website. In addition, the college officials with whom GAO spoke sometimes requested the federal government develop specific resources without realizing these resources already exist. Federal officials and representatives from college emergency preparedness associations have also observed gaps in awareness of federal resources among college officials and have acknowledged it as a challenge. For example, one agency official said that every time she goes to a conference, she finds more college officials who have not heard of key federal resources, signaling a continued need for more",

NRC staff record their time related to services, such as licensing, inspections, special projects, and license reviews, which is then billed to licensees to recover the full cost of these services. NRC staff also charge licensees for billable overhead costs, such as overhead costs for project managers and resident inspectors. GAO was asked to review NRC's billing process. This report examines (1) the extent to which NRC has implemented or plans to implement changes in four main areas of its billing process to address problems identified by NRC's Office of the Inspector General and NRC internal reviews, and (2) challenges licensees identified with NRC's billing process and NRC's recent and planned changes. GAO reviewed NRC documents and interviewed NRC staff and 13 licensees selected based on the number of licensees and work performed. GAO also interviewed NRC staff and 13 licensees. What GAO Found The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently implemented or plans to implement changes in four main areas of its billing process to address problems identified by NRC's Office of the Inspector General and NRC internal reviews: controls over activity codes, guidance and training for NRC staff, quarterly validation of charges, and charging licensees for billable overhead costs. NRC's Office of the Inspector General and internal reviews found problems with NRC's internal controls over activity codes, which affected the quality of data used for billing and other agency processes. The management of activity codes was decentralized, meaning that staff in NRC's offices generated the codes and each office followed its own policies and procedures regarding the setup and use of these codes. NRC also did not have a standardized set of activity codes to be used across the agency. Activity codes were instead linked to specific licensees, meaning that identical work activities for two licensees would require two different activity codes. These conditions resulted in an excessive number of activity codes in the agency's time and labor management system. NRC staff could also search and access the entire inventory of activity codes, including those unrelated to their work. NRC staff could also search and access the entire inventory of activity codes, including those unrelated to their work. NRC staff could also use manual generated reports to compile information they needed. NRC staff also charged licensees for billable overhead costs. NRC staff explained that the overhead costs went unbilled because project managers and resident inspectors charged billable overhead time to nonbillable activity codes, rather than to the billable activity codes associated with licensees. NRC staff said that the current quarterly validation process is not standardized across the regional and program offices and there is no agency guidance to ensure that staff in different offices conduct the process consistently. NRC is planning to standardize the quarterly validation process and to establish clear roles and responsibilities for staff participating in the process. Licensees GAO interviewed identified challenges with the amount of information available about NRC's billable work, and NRC's recent and planned changes may not fully address these challenges. Licensees GAO interviewed identified challenges with the amount of information available about NRC's billable work, and NRC's recent changes have made more information available, but some licensees are not aware of the information. Licensees also identified challenges with NRC's method of delivering paper invoices by mail, and although NRC's recent and planned changes may help address these challenges, NRC's plans are incomplete. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NRC (1) communicate to all licensees that supplemental billing information\u2014including biweekly reports and monthly status reports on contractor charges\u2014is available and how to request it; (2) develop agency policy and guidance for staff on what billing information related to contractor charges NRC staff can provide to licensees and how it should be provided; and (3) develop a project management plan that incorporates standards for project management, including establishing plans for schedule and cost. NRC agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-168": "Why GAO Did This Study The WOSB program enables federal contracting officers to identify and establish a sheltered market, or set-aside, for competition among WOSBs and EDWOSBs in certain industries. The 2015 NDAA included a provision for GAO to review the WOSB program. This report examines (1) the extent to which SBA has implemented changes to the WOSB program made by the 2015 NDAA; (2) the extent to which SBA has implemented changes to address previously identified oversight deficiencies; and (3) changes in WOSB program use since 2011 and stakeholder views on its use, including since the 2015 implementation of sole-source authority. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, SBA regulations, and SBA documentation; interviewed SBA officials; and analyzed federal procurement data from fiscal years 2011 through 2018. What GAO Found The Small Business Administration (SBA) has implemented one of the three changes that the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (2015 NDAA) made to the Women-Owned Small Business Program (WOSB program)\u2014sole-source authority. The two other changes\u2014authorizing SBA to implement its own certification process for WOSBs and requiring SBA to eliminate the WOSB self-certification option\u2014have not been implemented. The 2015 NDAA did not require a specific time frame for SBA to update its regulations. SBA officials have stated that they will not eliminate self-certification until the new certification process for the WOSB program is in place, which they expect to be completed by January 1, 2020. SBA has not fully addressed deficiencies in its oversight of third-party certifiers that GAO identified in its October 2014 report. GAO found that SBA did not have formal policies for reviewing the performance of its four approved third-party certifiers, including their compliance with their agreements with SBA. Further, GAO found that SBA had not developed formal policies and procedures for, among other things, reviewing the monthly reports that certifiers submit to SBA. As a result, GAO recommended that SBA establish comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess the performance of the third-party certifiers in accordance with their agreements with SBA and program regulations. While SBA has taken some steps to address the recommendation, as of February 2019, it remained open. SBA also has not fully addressed deficiencies in its eligibility examinations of WOSB program participants. GAO found that SBA lacked formalized guidance for its eligibility examination processes and that the examinations continued to identify high rates of potentially ineligible businesses. As a result, GAO recommended that SBA enhance its examination of businesses that register for the WOSB program to ensure that only eligible businesses obtain WOSB set-aside contracts. SBA has taken some steps to implement GAO's recommendation, such as completing its 2017 Standard Operating Procedures and its WOSB Program Desk Guide, both of which include written policies and procedures for WOSB program eligibility examinations. However, as of February 2019, SBA had not provided an updated SOP. SBA also has not fully addressed deficiencies that the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) identified previously\u2014and that GAO also identified during this review\u2014related to WOSB set-asides being awarded under ineligible industry codes. GAO's analysis of federal procurement data from fiscal years 2011 through 2018 found that 3.5 percent (or about $76 million) of WOSB program obligations were awarded under ineligible industry codes that were never eligible for the WOSB program. SBA officials said that they have discussed options for working with the General Services Administration (GSA) to add controls defining eligible NAICS codes for WOSB program set-aside opportunities on FedBizOpps.gov\u2014the website that contracting officers use to post announcements about available federal contracting opportunities. Adding controls to this system would help contracting officers realize as they are writing the contract requirements that they should not set aside contracts under the WOSB program without reviewing the proper NAICS codes. SBA officials said that the feasibility of this option was still being discussed and that the issue was not a high priority.

    "gao_GAO-18-440": "Why GAO Did This Study The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is responsible for investigating criminals and criminal organizations that use firearms, arson, or explosives in violent criminal activity. ATF referred about 13,000 firearms denials to its field divisions for investigation from fiscal years 2011 through 2017. GAO was asked to review federal and state efforts to investigate and prosecute firearms denials. This report (1) describes the extent to which federal and selected state law enforcement agencies investigate and prosecute firearms denial cases; (2) examines the challenges, if any, that federal and selected state law enforcement agencies face in investigating and prosecuting firearms denial cases; and (3) describes the circumstances that lead to the investigation and prosecution of persons denied firearms. GAO reviewed federal and state laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed ATF data on firearms denials; and interviewed federal and state officials and prosecutors in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. What GAO Found In fiscal year 2017, ATF referred about 13,000 firearms denials to its field divisions for investigation, of which USAOs had prosecuted 12 cases as of June 2018. In March 2018, the Attorney General issued a memo that directed all United States Attorneys to enhance prosecution of cases involving individuals who make false statements on the ATF Form 4473. Officials from 10 of 13 selected public safety (POC) states said that they do not investigate or prosecute firearms denials. Officials from all six selected ATF field divisions said that investigating firearms denials can be challenging because of the high volume and require use of their limited resources. ATF headquarters has not assessed the extent to which field divisions use warning notices in lieu of prosecution, which could provide greater awareness of their deterrence value. EOUSA officials said that denial cases are difficult to prosecute and offer less value for public safety than other prosecutions. State officials said that denial investigations compete with other investigations and can be difficult to successfully prosecute. While individuals are denied firearms purchases because they are prohibited from possessing firearms under federal or state law, federal denial investigations and prosecutions are generally based on additional aggravating circumstances. The types of denial cases that are referred for investigation in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia are determined in part by the priorities the states have set for such referrals. For example, in Oregon and Pennsylvania, which investigate all firearms denials, these priorities include cases involving stolen guns, purchasers with active warrants, active protection orders, and prior felony convictions. In Virginia, which investigates a subset of all denials based on risk, the state has a policy to prioritize denials that is similar to Oregon and Pennsylvania\u2014active warrants, active protection orders, and mental health issues. Prosecutions of denial cases in these states are generally based on the strength of the case\u2014including the adequacy and availability of proof the individual knew he or she was prohibited and falsified information\u2014and the nature of the ATF investigation itself. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that ATF assess the extent to which field divisions use warning notices in lieu of prosecution and determine whether any policy changes are needed. ATF concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-134T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has invested billions of dollars in broadband deployment on tribal lands. However, the cost of providing broadband service on tribal lands is high, and the federal government has not provided the appropriate share of federal funding to increase broadband deployment. GAO was asked to review broadband deployment on tribal lands. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which FCC collects and reports accurate and complete data on broadband deployment on tribal lands, (2) the extent to which tribal partnerships exist to increase broadband deployment, and (3) the barriers to obtaining federal funding for broadband deployment. This statement is based on GAO's September 2018 report on broadband deployment on tribal lands and selected updates conducted in September 2018. GAO reviewed FCC and RUS documents and interviewed FCC and RUS officials and tribal stakeholders. What GAO Found In its September 2018 report on broadband access on tribal lands, GAO found that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects broadband availability data from broadband providers, but its method for collecting the data does not accurately or completely capture broadband access\u2014the ability to obtain service\u2014on tribal lands. FCC defines \u201cavailable\u201d as whether the provider does\u2014or could, within a typical service interval or without an extraordinary commitment of resources\u2014provide service to at least one end-user premises in a census block. FCC officials told GAO that FCC measures availability at the census block level because sub-census block data may be costly to collect. However, FCC acknowledged that by requiring a provider to report where it could provide service, it is not possible to tell whether the provider would be unable or unwilling to take on additional subscribers in a census block it lists as served. In addition, when reporting on broadband access in tribal lands, FCC uses the broadband availability data described above, and does not collect information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access. These factors include affordability, service quality, and service denials. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most. GAO recommended FCC develop and implement methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands. FCC agreed with this recommendation and stated that it is exploring methods to collect more granular broadband deployment data. GAO also found that few tribal partnerships exist to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands. Because of the greater costs associated with deploying broadband on unserved tribal lands that are generally rural, with possibly rugged terrain, there may be little to no private sector incentive to deploy broadband or enter into a partnership arrangement to do so. GAO also reported in September 2018 that FCC and RUS are the primary sources of federal funding to deploy broadband infrastructure in rural and remote areas where the cost of providing service is high, including tribal lands. Based on GAO's review of the funding provided by four federal programs targeted to increase deployment in unserved areas, very little has gone directly to tribes or to tribally owned broadband providers. Specifically, GAO found that from 2010 to 2017, less than 1 percent of FCC funding and about 14 percent of RUS funding went directly to tribes and tribally owned providers. Combined, FCC and RUS funding totaled $34.6 billion during that time period and tribes and tribally owned providers received $235 million, or about 0.7 percent. The tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned broadband providers GAO interviewed cited several barriers that tribes may face when seeking federal funding for broadband deployment. These barriers include the statutory requirement for the eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) designation and grant application requirements. According to tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned broadband providers GAO interviewed, FCC has provided ETCs with billions of dollars to deploy service to unserved areas, but FCC's efforts have not always been successful in the hardest to reach areas, particularly tribal lands. The representatives stated that FCC's competitive market approach does not work where competition cannot be supported and that there needs to be a different approach. Similarly, tribal officials from Idaho told GAO that although the provider in their area has received millions of dollars in Connect America Fund subsidies, it has not deployed broadband on the tribal lands. What GAO Recommends GAO recommended that FCC develop and implement methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands. FCC agreed with this recommendation and stated that it is exploring methods to collect more granular broadband deployment data.",
    "gao_GAO-19-58": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends about $90 billion annually on IT. In 2012, OMB began requiring agencies to implement cloud services, which allow agencies to use shared pools of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage applications, and services) to provide IT services. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to implement cloud services. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected agencies have implemented cloud services, and (2) the benefits and challenges selected agencies have experienced in implementing cloud services. GAO analyzed OMB and agency guidance, and interviewed officials from OMB and 16 agencies selected based on their use of cloud services. GAO also interviewed officials from the selected agencies. What GAO Found The 16 selected agencies reported making progress in implementing cloud services\u2014namely, they established guidance for assessing investments for cloud services, performed those assessments, and implemented cloud services for their investments. However, the extent of these agencies' progress varied. Specifically, 10 of the 16 agencies established guidance for assessing all new and existing investments for cloud services, while 6 agencies did not. In addition, while these agencies had assessed the majority of their investments for cloud services planned for fiscal year 2019, 12 agencies had not completed an assessment of 10 or more IT investments for cloud services. Lastly, 10 of the 16 agencies reported a percentage increase in the use of cloud services from fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2019, while two agencies reported no percentage change and four agencies reported a decrease during this 4-year period. The 16 agencies in GAO's review made progress in implementing cloud services. Specifically, the 16 agencies reported that their spending on cloud investments had increased by over $1 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2018 for investments with total life-cycle costs of $1 million or more. However, the agencies reported that factors such as inconsistent tracking of spending data, along with confusion in interpreting OMB guidance, impacted the accuracy of their reported cloud spending data. In addition, 13 of the 16 agencies provided savings data indicating that they had saved hundreds of millions of dollars on cloud services, but agencies reported that they had problems with tracking this data. Further, six agencies reported that they had reinvested cloud savings into other IT modernization efforts or other improvements to IT services. Officials from 15 of the 16 agencies reported that they had realized several significant benefits from the adoption of cloud services, ranging from improvements in the delivery of IT services to increasing the efficiency of operations and systems. In addition, the 15 agencies noted that certain key practices enabled them to realize these benefits through the successful implementation of cloud services. These practices included establishing new governance planning activities and policies, reorganizing the management of agency IT resources, and having executive leadership involved to help drive acquisition efforts. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB require agencies to explicitly report, at least on a quarterly basis, the savings and cost avoidance associated with cloud computing investments. OMB and the 16 agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

The act required DHS to assess its cybersecurity workforce. The act also required DHS to report its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. This statement addresses the extent to which DHS (1) has identified and assigned employment codes to all of its cybersecurity positions, and (2) has identified and reported its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report, Cybersecurity: Federal Efforts Are Under Way That May Address Workforce Challenges, GAO-17-533T (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 4, 2017). What GAO Found The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to perform workforce assessment-related activities to identify and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. Specifically, the act called for DHS to (1) establish procedures for identifying and categorizing cybersecurity positions and assigning codes to positions (within 90 days of law's enactment); (2) identify all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions and determine the work category and specialty area of each; (3) assign employment codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions based on the position's primary cybersecurity work category and specialty areas; and (4) submit to OPM an annual report through 2021 that describes work categories and specialty areas of critical need and substantiates the critical need designations. The act required DHS to complete the majority of these activities by specific due dates between March 2015 and September 2016. Within DHS, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is responsible for carrying out these provisions, including the coordination of the department's overall efforts to identify, categorize, code, and report its cybersecurity workforce assessment progress to OPM and Congress. DHS has not fully identified cybersecurity positions or assigned employment codes in a complete and reliable manner. The act required DHS to establish procedures to identify and assign the appropriate employment code, in accordance with Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Guide to Data Standards, to all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions by March 2015. In addition, the act required DHS to establish procedures to identify and assign the appropriate employment code, in accordance with OPM's Guide to Data Standards, to all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions by March 2015. However, OCHCO did not update its procedures to include information on identifying positions and assigning codes until April 2016\u201413 months after the due date specified by the act. In addition, the procedures were not complete because they did not include information related to identifying and coding vacant positions, as the act required. Moreover, the departmental procedures did not identify the individual within each DHS component who was responsible for leading and overseeing the identification and coding of the component's cybersecurity positions. Further, although components were able to supplement the departmental procedures by developing their own component-specific procedures for identifying and coding their cybersecurity positions, OCHCO did not review those procedures for consistency with departmental guidance. The department could not provide documentation that OCHCO had verified or reviewed component-developed procedures. Without assurance that procedures are timely, complete, and reviewed, DHS cannot be certain that its components have the procedures to identify and code all positions with cybersecurity functions, as required by the act. Accordingly, GAO recommended that DHS (1) develop procedures on how to identify and code vacant cybersecurity positions, (2) identify the individual in each component who is responsible for leading that component's efforts in identifying and coding cybersecurity positions, and (3) establish and implement a process to periodically review each component's procedures for identifying component cybersecurity positions and maintaining accurate coding. DHS concurred with the recommendations and stated that it would implement them by April 30, 2018. DHS has not yet completed required identification activities. The act required DHS to identify all of its cybersecurity positions, including vacant positions, by September 2015. Further, the act called for the department to use OPM's Guide to Data Standards to categorize the identified positions and determine the work category or specialty area of each position. As of December 2016, the department reported that it had identified 10,725 cybersecurity positions, including 6,734 federal civilian positions, 584 military positions, and 3,407 contractor positions. Nevertheless, as of November 2017, the department had not completed identifying all of its cybersecurity positions and it had not determined the work categories or specialty areas of the positions. In explaining why the department had not identified all its positions, OCHCO officials stated that components varied in reporting their identified vacant positions because the department did not have a system to track vacancies. In addition, the act required DHS to assign 2-digit employment codes",
    "gao_GAO-18-571T": "Why GAO Did This Study This testimony discusses the results of GAO's work on the federal government's fiscal year 2017 budget request. GAO's work has contributed to a number of key authorizations and appropriations. In addition, congressional oversight of agencies' efforts has been critical in realizing the full benefits of GAO's suggested actions addressed to the executive branch. This testimony is based on GAO's 2018 annual report, which is being released today. It addresses (1) the progress that Congress and executive branch agencies have made in addressing the issues GAO identified in each of its last seven annual reports, (2) the financial benefits that have resulted from actions taken by Congress and executive branch agencies, and (3) the potential for additional benefits. This statement is based on GAO's 2018 annual report, which is being released today. What GAO Found The progress that Congress and executive branch agencies have made in addressing the issues GAO identified in each of its last seven annual reports has resulted in $178 billion in financial benefits, including roughly $125 billion in financial benefits from 2010 through 2017, with at least an additional $53 billion in estimated benefits projected to accrue in 2018 or later. These financial benefits continue to grow as GAO and others have reported on problems caused by fragmented leadership and a lack of a single authority in oversight of these multibillion dollar programs. GAO anticipates that CMS's recent actions could potentially reduce the federal government's liability for Medicaid by billions, or tens of billions, annually. While not all actions result in financial benefits to taxpayers, all of GAO's suggested actions, when implemented, can result in other benefits\u2014for instance, they make government more efficient or eliminate, reduce, or improve management of fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative programs. For example, such benefits can be seen in the results of GAO's work on the government's acquisition of space programs. For over two decades, GAO and others have reported on problems caused by fragmented leadership and a lack of a single authority in oversight of these multibillion dollar programs. In 2012, GAO made a recommendation aimed at strengthening leadership and authority of space systems acquisitions. In response to a recommendation GAO made in 2012, Congress made changes to certain DOD space leadership positions and required the department to conduct a review and identify a recommended organizational and management structure for its national security space components, and submit related reports. The act also required DOD to contract with a federally funded research and development center not closely affiliated with the Air Force to develop a plan to establish a separate military department responsible for DOD national security space activities. These actions could reduce fragmentation and speed decision making in the development of a substantial investment in space systems. While Congress and executive branch agencies have made progress toward addressing the 798 total actions GAO has identified since 2011, further steps are needed to fully address the 365 actions that are partially addressed or not addressed. GAO estimates that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be realized should Congress and executive branch agencies fully address open actions. In addition to producing financial benefits, these actions make government more efficient; improve major government programs or agencies; reduce the risk of mismanagement, fraud, waste, and abuse; and increase assurance that programs comply with laws and funds are legally spent. In its 2011 to 2018 annual reports, GAO directed 100 actions to Congress, including the 3 new congressional actions GAO identified in 2018. Of the 100 actions, 58 remain open (11 of which were partially addressed and 47 were not addressed or new) as of March 2018. Of the 100 actions, 58 remain open (11 of which were partially addressed and 47 were not addressed or new) as of March 2018.",
    "gao_GAO-19-166": "Why GAO Did This Study The effects of climate change may affect migration patterns across the globe. For example, sea level rise, a slow-onset disaster, may result in the salinization of soil and drinking water, thereby undermining a country's ability to sustain livelihoods and maintain critical services, which could cause some people to migrate. Sudden-onset disasters may also contribute to migration as people flee natural disasters, in most cases leading to temporary displacement. For example, people may either voluntarily migrate, or be forced to migrate, to earn money needed to rebuild damaged homes after flooding, especially as extreme weather events increase in intensity and number. The effects of climate change add another layer of complexity to this decision, but there is debate about the role climate change plays in migration. GAO was asked to review the effects of climate change on migration. This report (1) describes executive branch actions related to climate change and migration from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) examines the extent to which the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD) have discussed the potential effects of climate change on migration in their plans and risk assessments; and (3) describes State, USAID, and DOD activities, if any, that are related to climate change and global migration. GAO reviewed executive actions, budget requests, and executive branch strategies that affected State, USAID, and DOD, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found State, USAID, and DOD were required by executive orders to assess climate change-related risks to their missions and, for State and USAID, to their strategies, among other things. In response to Executive Order 13653, which has since been revoked, the agencies completed adaptation plans that integrated considerations of climate change into agency operations and overall mission objectives. In response to Executive Order 13677, which has not been revoked, State and USAID developed processes for climate change risk assessments for their country and regional planning documents. Although these assessments are not specific to migration, a few of the assessments identified the nexus of climate change and migration. State issued new guidance to its missions in 2018, but this guidance does not include information on the process for assessing climate change-related risks to its integrated country strategies. Without clear guidance on its process for assessing climate change-related risks to its integrated country strategies, missions may not examine climate change as a risk to their strategic objectives or to do so in a consistent manner, and thus may not have the information they would need to identify migration as a risk of climate change. State, USAID, and DOD have some activities that could potentially address climate change as a driver of migration, although none of these activities specifically focused on the issue. For example, USAID has climate change adaptation activities, but to date migration has not been a focus of this programming. With the shift in priorities related to climate change in fiscal year 2017, agencies have reduced some of these activities. For example, USAID has climate change adaptation activities, but to date migration has not been a focus of this programming. With the shift in priorities related to climate change in fiscal year 2017, agencies have reduced some of these activities. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State (1) provide missions with guidance that clearly documents its process for assessing climate change-related risks to its integrated country strategies; (2) provide missions with climate change risk assessments for integrated country strategies; and (3) provide missions with climate change risk assessments for integrated country strategies. State did not oppose the recommendation and noted that the agency will update its integrated country strategy guidance by June 30, 2019 to inform missions that they have the option to include an annex on climate resilience, as well as other topics. However, State indicated that the agency will begin working with stakeholders to consider whether to recommend that the Secretary of State ask the President to rescind Executive Order 13677.

    "gao_GAO-19-141": "Why GAO Did This Study In fiscal year 2016, Medicare paid about $1.4 billion to LTCHs, a large proportion of which were paid at the standard rate. The Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 modified the LTCH payment system by establishing a two-tiered payment system\u2014such that certain LTCH discharges continue to be paid at the standard rate and others are paid at a generally lower, site-neutral rate. The act also required GAO to review Medicare payments to LTCHs. This report examines (1) the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries who receive services at the two qualifying hospitals need specialized follow-up care to manage the chronic, long-term effects of a catastrophic spinal cord or brain injury, and (2) the extent to which the two qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs treat similar patients and provide similar services. GAO analyzed Medicare claims data, Medicare claims data, and other information from the two qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs. GAO also interviewed officials from the two qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs, and other stakeholders. What GAO Found GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at the two qualifying hospitals need specialized follow-up care to manage the chronic, long-term effects of a catastrophic spinal cord or brain injury. Most of these patients are younger than 65 and ineligible for Medicare at the time of their initial injury, according to officials from the qualifying hospitals. Instead, according to officials, these patients typically become eligible for Medicare 2 years or more after their initial injury due to disability. GAO found that the two qualifying hospitals primarily treated traumatic spinal cord or brain injuries, but their Medicare populations differed from each other during the period from fiscal year 2013 to 2016. Specifically, during this time, the two qualifying hospitals\u2014Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center\u2014were commonly assigned to three diagnosis groups covering spinal procedures and spinal disorders and injuries. GAO found that the two qualifying hospitals would have been paid at the blended site-neutral rate\u2014equal to 50 percent of the site-neutral rate and 50 percent of the standard rate\u2014if applicable payment policies from future years (2017 through 2021) were applied to those discharges. GAO found that the two qualifying hospitals would have received some payments at the standard rate, but that most of their discharges would have been paid at the lower, site-neutral rate\u2014assuming similar caseloads (e.g., patient mix). GAO also found that the two qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs may have fewer services provided and fewer patients served by the qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs. For example, officials from Craig Hospital told GAO they stopped providing post-operative care to patients requiring spinal surgery, such as patients with syringomyelia, in 2016\u2014instead referring them to other facilities\u2014in part because these discharges do not meet the criteria for the standard rate. As of September 2018, they do not plan to provide this care in the future unless the temporary exception is extended. Officials from the two qualifying hospitals and some stakeholders GAO interviewed noted that the LTCH site-neutral payment policies may result in fewer services provided and fewer patients served by the qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs. For example, officials from Craig Hospital told GAO they stopped providing post-operative care to patients requiring spinal surgery, such as patients with syringomyelia, in 2016\u2014instead referring them to other facilities\u2014in part because these discharges do not meet the criteria for the standard rate. As of September 2018, they do not plan to provide this care in the future unless the temporary exception is extended. Officials from the two qualifying hospitals and some stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested the two qualifying hospitals treat patients with conditions different from those treated at most other LTCHs, and can offer specialized care. Officials from the two qualifying hospitals told GAO that, relative to most other facilities\u2014including most traditional LTCHs\u2014they offer a more complete continuum of care to meet the needs of patients at different stages of spinal cord and brain injury treatment, without the need to transfer to different facilities. Officials also stated that, unlike most traditional LTCHs, they are able to offer more specialized care for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, including more comprehensive rehabilitation services. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally agreed that the two qualifying hospitals have developed expertise in treating spinal cord and brain injury patients and offer intensive rehabilitation services that are not provided in most other LTCHs. Differences in payment systems and data limitations make it difficult to directly compare the attributes of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the two qualifying hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF), including the costs of care they receive. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-277T": "Why GAO Did This Study NASA's space telescopes are critical to the nation's ability to explore the universe and to understand the origin and destiny of the universe. NASA's current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects\u2014WFIRST, TESS, and JWST\u2014that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. This statement discusses (1) the status of NASA's major space telescope projects and (2) lessons learned from NASA acquisitions that could help to minimize cost overruns and schedule delays. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work on NASA's major space telescope projects. GAO reviewed NASA's acquisition policies and procedures, interviewed NASA officials, and reviewed relevant NASA documents. What GAO Found The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects\u2014WFIRST, TESS, and JWST\u2014that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. WFIRST is in the earliest stages of the acquisition life cycle. With preliminary cost estimates ranging from $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion, this project is an observatory designed to perform wide-field imaging and survey of the sky at near-infrared wavelengths to answer questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and to expand our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. TESS\u2014a smaller project whose latest cost estimate is approximately $337 million\u2014is targeted to launch in March 2018 and will be used to conduct the first extensive survey of the sky from space for transiting exoplanets. Finally, JWST, with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion, is one of NASA's most complex projects and top priorities. The telescope is designed to help understand the origin and destiny of the universe, the creation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies, and the formation of stars and planetary systems. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST's science instruments are to detect very faint infrared sources and, as such, are required to operate at extremely cold temperatures. To help keep these instruments cold, a multi-layered tennis-court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these three projects are each making progress in line with their phase of the acquisition cycle, but also face challenges in execution. Some of these challenges are unique to the projects themselves and some are common among the projects in NASA's portfolio. For example, when projects enter the integration and test phase, unforeseen challenges can arise and affect the cost and schedule for the project. As Congress, NASA, and the science community consider future telescope efforts, it will be exceedingly important to shape and manage new programs in a manner that minimizes cost overruns and schedule delays. This is particularly important for the largest programs as even small cost increases can have reverberating effects. NASA's telescope and other science projects will always have inherent technical, design, and integration risks because they are complex, specialized, and often push the state of the art in space technology. But too often, GAO reports find that management and oversight problems\u2014which can include poor planning, optimistic cost estimating, funding gaps, lax oversight, and poor contractor performance, among other issues\u2014are the real drivers behind cost and schedule growth. To its credit, NASA has taken significant steps, partly in response to GAO's past recommendations, to reduce acquisition risk from both a technical and management standpoint, including actions to enhance cost and schedule estimating, provide adequate levels of reserves to projects, establish better processes and metrics to monitor projects, and expand the use of earned value management to better monitor contractor performance. Moreover, in recent years, GAO has found that many of the projects within the agency's major project portfolio have improved their cost and schedule performance. Nevertheless, the extent to which NASA has adopted some of the following lessons learned within its portfolio of major projects is mixed, and NASA has an opportunity to strengthen its program management of major acquisitions, including its space telescopes, by doing so.",
    "gao_GAO-18-249": "Why GAO Did This Study The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is tasked with reviewing certain foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers of U.S. businesses to determine the effect of the transaction on the national security of the United States. CFIUS reviews transactions involving a large variety of countries and industry sectors to determine if such transactions pose a threat to national security and whether the transactions should be allowed to proceed. GAO was asked to review CFIUS. This report (1) examines changes in CFIUS workload and staffing from 2011 through 2016, and (2) provides information on stakeholder views on potential changes to CFIUS. GAO reviewed relevant laws, executive orders, and regulations; analyzed CFIUS workload and staffing data from 2011 through 2016; and interviewed CFIUS member agency officials and external experts. What GAO Found The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has experienced an increase in workload in recent years, but Treasury, as CFIUS lead, has not coordinated member agency efforts to better understand staffing levels needed to complete core committee functions. According to CFIUS member agency officials, the volume of transactions notified to the committee and the complexity of CFIUS reviews in terms of technology, transaction structure, and national security concerns have increased substantially from 2011 through 2016, while CFIUS staffing levels have experienced a modest increase during the same time period. Member agency officials stated that CFIUS is able to review all transactions that have been voluntarily notified to the committee. However, many stakeholders, including most member agency officials and several external experts, expressed concerns that CFIUS member agencies were limited in their ability to complete other CFIUS functions, such as identifying non-notified transactions. In addition, agency officials were unsure if they would have sufficient staff if the CFIUS workload were to continue to increase. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish the organizational structure necessary to achieve its objectives and periodically evaluate this structure. Treasury has not coordinated member agency efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to complete the current and future CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions. Without attaining an understanding of the staffing levels needed to address the current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if legislative changes to CFIUS's authorities further expand its workload, CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and address threats to the national security of the United States. CFIUS member agencies and selected nonmember participant agencies, as well as external experts, offered a range of views on the potential benefits and drawbacks to possible changes to CFIUS. In general, CFIUS member agencies and nonmember participant agencies stated that the existing structure is working effectively and described drawbacks to potential changes, such as changing membership or voting rights. Perspectives among agency officials and external experts varied on the potential effects of redefining which transactions should be considered for CFIUS review, such as requiring CFIUS to review all covered transactions. Agency officials and external experts described a range of potential effects of expanding the list of factors CFIUS considers, such as requiring CFIUS to review all covered transactions. Many officials and external experts agreed that one potential drawback of many of the possible changes is a likely increase to the CFIUS workload, generating concerns about the committee's capacity to complete its core functions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury, as CFIUS lead, and working with member agencies, should coordinate member agencies' efforts to better understand the staffing levels needed to address the current and projected CFIUS workload associated with core committee functions. Treasury agreed with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-107": "Why GAO Did This Study SIV holders are special immigrants who have worked for the U.S. government for at least one year as translators or interpreters. SIV holders are eligible for resettlement assistance upon arrival in the United States. GAO was asked to review the resettlement process for SIV holders. This report examines (1) the extent to which SIV holders are self-sufficient and (2) the challenges SIV holders face in resettling in the United States. GAO analyzed data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of State (State) on SIV holders and interviewed officials from national and local resettlement agencies and SIV holders who participated in 11 focus groups with SIV holders in selected states. GAO also interviewed officials from national and local resettlement agencies and advocacy groups. What GAO Found Limited data from the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) from fiscal years 2011 through 2017 showed that most principal special immigrant visa (SIV) holders were unemployed and relied on cash assistance for income 90 days after arrival to the United States. Available data from ORR for one of its programs, the Matching Grant program, provide slightly longer-term information, but only cover a portion of SIV holders and are not representative. ORR's Matching Grant data for fiscal year 2016 (the only year available) showed that most SIV holders were employed 6 months after arrival and no longer reliant on cash assistance. Although ORR regularly surveys the general refugee population up to 5 years after resettlement in order to examine their longer-term outcomes, it has never surveyed SIV holders for such information. Despite ORR's efforts to examine the long-term outcomes of refugees and related populations, it has not yet fully explored the feasibility of doing so or other possibilities to obtain information about the SIV holder population. Without longer-term data or other in-depth research, neither ORR nor policymakers have information as to whether SIV holders have progressed beyond the immediate goal of basic self-sufficiency toward improved economic security and cultural integration over the longer term. SIV holders faced a variety of challenges while resettling in the United States, according to representatives of 13 local resettlement agencies and SIV holders who participated in 11 focus groups. Among local resettlement agencies, the two in Northern Virginia reported significant challenges with their capacity to assist the large numbers of SIV holders in the area, while agencies in other locations GAO visited reported fewer capacity challenges. SIV holders also experienced challenges finding skilled employment, which did not align with their expectations of resettlement in the United States. For example, SIV holders often expected better housing or to be placed in certain locations near the main SIV holder community; however, this was not always possible due to limited availability of affordable housing. SIV holders also experienced challenges finding skilled employment, which did not align with their expectations of resettlement in the United States. For example, SIV holders often expected better housing or to be placed in certain locations near the main SIV holder community; however, this was not always possible due to limited availability of affordable housing. Finally, SIV holders often expected more assistance in obtaining high-skilled employment than they generally received. For example, some SIV holders said they expected more assistance in obtaining high-skilled employment than they generally received. However, the persistent gap among SIV holders' expectations and their experiences suggests that these efforts are falling short. For example, the informational materials for SIV holders are general and lack specific details or more in-depth information on issues, such as housing affordability, employment, or the type of government assistance they will or are likely to receive. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that ORR include SIV holders in its Annual Survey of Refugees, and that PRM identify and implement additional ways to deliver information to prospective SIV holders about resettlement to assist with adjustment and expectations after arrival in the United States. HHS and State agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-643": "Why GAO Did This Study WMATA operates the nation's second largest heavy rail transit system and fifth largest bus system. WMATA's ridership declined from about 17 percent in fiscal year 2006 to about 12 percent in fiscal year 2017. WMATA's pension plans are governed by a collective bargaining agreement. GAO was asked to review WMATA's workforce costs. This report assesses (1) how WMATA's workforce costs have changed from fiscal years 2006 through 2017 and factors contributing to those changes; (2) how WMATA identifies and addresses its current and future workforce needs; and (3) how WMATA has designed, implemented, and monitored its employee performance management systems. GAO analyzed WMATA's budgets and audited financial statements from fiscal years 2006 through 2017; reviewed WMATA's employee and retiree benefit costs; and interviewed WMATA and DOT officials. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2006 through 2017, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) total workforce costs\u2014composed of wages, salaries, and benefits for current and retired employees\u2014increased modestly in inflation-adjusted dollars (on average by about 3 percent annually) from fiscal years 2006 through 2017. This modest increase reflected small increases in wage and salary costs and substantial increases in employee and retiree benefit costs. In particular, WMATA's required annual contributions to its pension plans increased by an annual average of almost 19 percent and were WMATA's fastest growing workforce cost component from fiscal years 2006 through 2017. The possibility of further increases in the costs of WMATA's pension plans poses significant risk to the agency's financial operations, yet WMATA has not fully assessed these risks. WMATA identifies the staffing levels it needs each year through its annual budgeting process, but does not have a strategic process to identify and address its long-term workforce needs to meet the agency's goals. For example, in preparing the annual budget request for the Board of Directors, WMATA officials identify the number of staff needed in individual departments the following fiscal year. However, WMATA does not have a process for identifying and addressing agency-wide workforce needs beyond one year or in relation to agency-wide goals, contrary to leading practices. In addition, WMATA has some workforce development programs, including some that are piloted or planned, but these programs are not based on an agency-wide assessment of the skills the agency needs to meet its strategic goals. Instead, WMATA's workforce development programs are directed to short-term needs such as filling vacancies. WMATA has implemented two performance management systems to cover its various employee groups, but these systems lack some key elements of an effective performance management system. Specifically, WMATA has linked employee performance to pay for some employees; however, WMATA's performance management systems do not (1) consistently align employee and agency goals or assign responsibilities, (2) make meaningful distinctions in performance, or (3) consistently use competencies to identify the behaviors individual employees need to contribute to strategic goals. In addition, WMATA does not have sufficient controls to ensure that supervisors submit complete, accurate, and timely performance reviews and use performance management information to track progress towards strategic goals. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that WMATA conduct a comprehensive assessment of the financial risks to which it is exposed from its pension plans and communicate the results to its pension plan trustees and other stakeholders, such as its Board of Directors. WMATA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-470": "Why GAO Did This Study The executive orders issued in January 2017 directed executive branch agencies to implement a series of reporting, policy, and programmatic provisions to carry out the administration's border security and immigration policies and priorities. The executive orders also directed DHS to, among other actions, produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border; issue new policy guidance regarding the appropriate and consistent use of detention of foreign nationals for violations of immigration law; plan, design, and construct a wall or other physical barriers along the southern border; and hire and on-board, as soon as practicable, 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents. The executive orders also directed DHS and DOJ to ensure that jurisdictions that willfully prohibit or otherwise restrict communication with DHS regarding immigration status information are not eligible to receive federal grants, except as determined necessary for law enforcement purposes. GAO was asked to review the implementation of executive orders. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS, DOJ, and State have implemented the executive orders and (2) the resources DHS, DOJ, and State used to implement the executive orders. GAO reviewed executive order provisions and agency documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed budgetary data from DHS, DOJ, and State. What GAO Found The Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State (State) each play key roles in enforcing U.S. immigration law and securing U.S. borders. DHS, DOJ, and State issued reports, developed or revised policies, and took initial planning and programmatic actions in response to the executive orders. Each agency took a distinct approach to implementing the orders based on its organizational structure and the scope of its responsibilities. For example, DHS established an Executive Order Task Force, which was responsible for coordinating and tracking initial component actions to implement the executive orders. DHS also initiated a number of planning and programmatic actions to implement the executive orders. For example, DHS terminated the Priority Enforcement Program, under which ICE prioritized the apprehension, detention, and removal of foreign nationals who posed threats to national security, public safety, or border security, including convicted felons; and restored the Secure Communities Program, pursuant to which ICE may also target for removal those charged, but not yet convicted, of criminal offenses, among others.

For example, DHS directed ICE to terminate outreach or advocacy services to potentially removable foreign nationals, and reallocate all resources currently used for such purposes to a new office to assist victims of crimes allegedly perpetrated by removable foreign nationals (the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or VOICE, office, established in April 2017). DHS, DOJ, and State used existing fiscal year 2017 resources to support initial executive order actions; DHS also received and expended supplemental funds to implement the executive orders. For example, DHS received $65.4 million for hiring and, according to DHS officials, used these funds to plan and prepare for the surge in Border Patrol agents directed by Executive Order 13767. DHS also received and expended supplemental funds in May 2017 to implement the executive orders. DHS and DOJ officials anticipate additional costs to further implement the executive orders and expect that certain provisions will require a multi-year effort. DHS officials noted that additional future planning and funds will be needed to fully implement actions in the orders. Agencies plan to continue to use their base budgets as well as request additional funds as needed to carry out their mission. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DHS provided written comments,",
    "gao_GAO-18-467": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for acquiring billions of dollars in goods and services annually. DOD has a demanding contracting process that includes solicitation issuance, solicitation evaluation, and contract award. GAO was asked to review the time taken to award contracts. This report examines (1) DOD's efforts to determine the time it takes to award contracts; (2) what available data show regarding the time between solicitation issuance and award for selected weapon systems-related contracts; and (3) factors identified as contributing to contract award time frames. GAO analyzed DOD data on the time between solicitation issuance and award for a nongeneralizable sample of 129 contracts, based on the highest total number of contracts and highest total contract value. GAO also surveyed contracting officials for 37 contracts, selected based on the number of contracts and highest total contract value. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) components have efforts underway to track and reduce the time to award contracts, but these efforts are not coordinated across the department. The DOD components collect information on the time to award contracts, but differ on what information they collect and how they use it. DOD is taking a number of actions to understand the information the components collect such as determining what events are tracked, but DOD does not have a department-wide strategy for collecting and assessing the components' information. DOD has proposed reducing the time to award contracts by as much as 50 percent over a 3-year period, as measured from the receipt of the requirements to contract award. DOD officials also plan to expand this effort to include competitively awarded contracts. While DOD has proposed reducing the length of time to award contracts by as much as 50 percent, according to DOD officials, it does not have a department-wide strategy for collecting and assessing the components' information. Internal control standards for the federal government state that management should use relevant information to make informed decisions and evaluate an agency's performance in achieving key objectives and establish a baseline as a measure to assess progress in achieving its goals. Without a strategy for data collection and assessment, DOD will be limited in its ability to assess progress toward achieving its proposed goal and addressing challenges across components. GAO's review of a nongeneralizable selection of 129 weapon systems-related contracts had a wide range of time intervals from solicitation issuance to award. The time intervals from solicitation to award ranged from less than a month to more than 4 years, with a median of about 9 months. Based on GAO's analysis, 88 of the 129 contracts were awarded less than a year from the solicitation issuance date, while 38 were awarded between 1 and 2 years. The remaining 3 selected contracts took more than 2 years to award. The results of GAO's survey of contracting officials for 37 contracts showed that contracting officials cited a number of factors\u2014such as the quality of the proposal\u2014that helped reduce or increase the time to award the selected contracts. They did not identify any one factor that consistently affected the time to award. Officials for more than half of the contracts reported needing more time to award the contracts than they initially anticipated. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD develop a strategy regarding contract award time frames that identifies: the information the department needs to collect; and how the department will use the information to assess the time it takes to award contracts. DOD concurred with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-404T": "Why GAO Did This Study RFA requires federal agencies, including financial regulators, to analyze the impact of proposed and final regulations on small entities. If a rule might have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, regulators are to consider any significant regulatory alternatives that will achieve statutory objectives while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. The act also requires regulators to conduct retrospective reviews of regulations to determine if they should be continued without change, amended, or rescinded (consistent with statutory objectives) to minimize any significant economic impact on small entities. This statement discusses (1) the burden of regulations on small entities, (2) the extent to which regulators have conducted retrospective reviews, and (3) the extent to which regulators have developed policies and procedures for conducting retrospective reviews. This statement is based on GAO's February 2018 report (GAO-2018-02-534) and selected updates from the 2017 EGRPRA report (GAO-2018-02-534) and selected updates from the 2017 EGRPRA report (GAO-2018-02-534). GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed regulators and consumer advocacy groups; and conducted focus groups with representatives from 28 community banks and credit unions. What GAO Found The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) requires federal agencies, including financial regulators, engaged in substantive rulemaking to analyze the impact of proposed and final regulations on small entities. If a rule might have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, regulators are to consider any significant regulatory alternatives that will achieve statutory objectives while minimizing any significant economic impact on small entities. However, GAO found several weaknesses with the RFA analyses, policies, and procedures of six financial regulators\u2014Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\u2014that could undermine the goal of RFA and limit transparency and public accountability. The EGRPRA process requires regulators to conduct analyses during the rulemaking process that are intended to minimize economic impact on small entities. However, GAO found several weaknesses with the RFA analyses, policies, and procedures of six financial regulators\u2014Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and CFPB\u2014that could undermine the goal of RFA and limit transparency and public accountability. For example, in reviewing 66 certifications by the six regulators, GAO found that in most (43 of 66) the regulators provided a factual basis and concluded the rule would not apply to small entities or have any economic impact. According to the regulators, these rules included activities in which small entities do not engage, pertained to the regulator's internal processes, did not create new regulatory requirements, or eliminated duplicative rules. Additionally, regulators concluded in 5 of 66 certifications that the rule would have a beneficial impact on small entities. Other certifications lacked information that would help explain the determination. For example, incomplete disclosure of methodology and data sources could limit the public and affected entities' ability to offer informed comments in response to regulators' certification assessments in proposed rules. The results of the 2017 EGRPRA review of regulations that were not included in the most recent EGRPRA review were not included in the most recent EGRPRA report. The statute mandating the process does not include CFPB and thus the significant mortgage-related regulations and other regulations that it administers\u2014regulations that banks and credit unions generally must follow\u2014were not included in the most recent EGRPRA review. The depository institution regulators cannot address these mortgage regulation-related burdens because they no longer have rulemaking authority for certain consumer financial statutes. However, CFPB does have its own processes to assess the burden of regulations it has implemented. For example, section 1022(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires CFPB to conduct a one-time assessment of each significant rule it adopts under federal consumer financial law within 5 years of the rule's effective date. But CFPB staff told GAO that they have not yet determined whether certain other regulations that apply to banks and credit unions, such as the revisions to requirements, will be designated as significant and thus subjected to the one-time assessments. Until CFPB publicly provides additional information indicating its commitment to periodically review the burden of all its regulations, community banks, credit unions, and other depository institutions may face diminished opportunities for regulatory relief.

    "gao_GAO-18-575": "Why GAO Did This Study North American energy integration is a key component of U.S. energy security. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are the largest and fourth largest foreign suppliers of crude oil to the United States. The United States is by far Canada's most significant crude oil customer. Canada and Mexico are major buyers of petroleum products refined in the United States. A growing trade in natural gas produced in the United States is also increasingly important to the energy relationship among the three countries. GAO was asked to review energy integration. This report examines (1) ways in which the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican governments cooperate on North American energy integration; (2) U.S. agencies' activities to facilitate North American energy integration; (3) U.S. agencies' efforts to coordinate among themselves on North American energy integration; (4) ways in which U.S. agencies obtain feedback and input from U.S. industry and civil society regarding North American energy integration; and (5) steps that U.S., Canadian, and Mexican officials suggested to further facilitate North American energy integration. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Departments of Energy (DOE), Interior, Commerce, State, DOT, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, USAID, and Treasury; surveyed agencies; and interviewed officials from the three countries. What GAO Found The United States cooperates on energy integration with Canada and Mexico strategically at the presidential and ministry levels and technically at the agency level, although progress on some strategic efforts has been limited. At the presidential level, trilateral cooperation has occurred mainly through the North American Leaders' Summit, where the leaders of the three countries discuss economic issues, including energy, according to U.S. government officials. The last summit was in 2016, and as of April 2018 a future summit had not been scheduled. At the ministry level, DOE and State have recently conducted meetings with their Canadian and Mexican counterparts. However, efforts to develop a North American Energy Strategy were placed on hold in late 2017 because of disagreement about its scope, although discussions resumed in 2018. At the agency level, U.S. officials and their counterparts in Mexico and Canada cooperate technically to address specific issues related to North American energy integration. The eight federal agencies that GAO identified as having a role in North American energy integration\u2014DOE, Interior, Commerce, State, DOT, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, USAID, and Treasury\u2014reported involvement in 81 activities related to facilitating energy integration from 2014 through 2017. While some of these activities had multiple purposes or goals, the activities generally comprised five types: technical discussions and assistance, regulatory cooperation, international agreements and other instruments, trade promotion, and research and development. In addition, agencies reported undertaking other activities, such as internal policy reviews. Agency officials reported coordinating their energy integration-related activities through a number of coordination efforts and mechanisms. First, an interagency working group at the National Security Council (NSC) represents a high-level interagency coordination effort. Second, agency staff engage in working-level efforts such as serving on formal coordinating bodies that bring together stakeholders in the energy sector; soliciting input from, or providing input to, other agencies; and participating in direct coordination activities at the program level. Third, agency staff engage in working-level efforts such as serving on formal coordinating bodies that bring together stakeholders in the energy sector; soliciting input from, or providing input to, other agencies; and participating in direct coordination activities at the program level. Some of the officials GAO interviewed from all three countries suggested several new or additional steps that the U.S. government could take, in cooperation with Canada and Mexico, to address factors that might impede energy integration and to facilitate a more integrated and secure energy market in North America. Suggestions mentioned by officials in all three countries included aligning energy-related regulations, streamlining the U.S. presidential permitting process, facilitating cross-border transportation of equipment and workers, and involving states and provinces in energy integration efforts. However, U.S., Canadian, and Mexican officials GAO interviewed expressed general satisfaction with bilateral and trilateral strategic and technical cooperation regarding efforts to facilitate North American energy integration. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of State (1) coordinate their energy integration activities through a high-level interagency working group, (2) solicit and provide input from private sector and civil society stakeholders, and (3) take steps to further facilitate North American energy integration. DOE, Interior, Commerce, State, DOT, FERC, USAID, and Treasury provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",

Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation's security, prosperity, and well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, GAO has identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take. GAO has also made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing the four cybersecurity challenges. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because many of these recommendations have not been implemented. Of the roughly 3,000 recommendations made since 2010, nearly 1,000 had not been implemented as of August 2018.

Until GAO's recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. What GAO Found GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, GAO has identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take. These actions include developing and executing a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, securing federal systems and information, protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and protecting privacy and sensitive data. Until these recommendations are fully implemented, federal agencies may be limited in their ability to provide effective oversight of critical government-wide initiatives, address challenges with cybersecurity workforce management, and better ensure the security of emerging technologies. In addition, GAO has several ongoing reviews related to this challenge. These include reviews of: the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies' efforts to submit complete and reliable baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces; the extent to which DOD has established training standards for cyber mission force personnel; and selected agencies' ability to implement cloud service technologies and notable benefits this might have on agencies.

    "gao_GAO-19-48": "Why GAO Did This Study The nation's pipeline network is a vital part of the nation's transportation infrastructure. Terrorists and other malicious actors have attempted to disrupt the nation's pipeline network. TSA's Pipeline Security Branch is responsible for overseeing the physical security and cybersecurity of the nation's pipeline system. GAO was asked to review TSA's pipeline security program. This report examines (1) the extent to which pipeline operators use security guidelines and standards to address their physical and cybersecurity risks, and (2) the extent to which TSA has established performance measures and data to assess the effectiveness of its efforts to reduce risks to pipelines. GAO reviewed TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines, analyzed TSA data, and interviewed TSA officials and 10 pipeline operators and industry association representatives. What GAO Found Pipeline operators that GAO interviewed reported using a range of guidelines and standards to address their physical and cybersecurity risks, and all of them reported implementing the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) voluntary Pipeline Security Guidelines that were applicable to their operations. TSA revised and issued its Pipeline Security Guidelines in March 2018, but the revised guidelines lack a documented process to consider updates to supporting guidance such as to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework. Without a documented process defining how frequently TSA is to review and revise its guidelines, TSA cannot ensure that its guidelines reflect the latest known standards and best practices for physical and cybersecurity, or address the persistent and dynamic security threat environment currently facing the nation's pipeline system. TSA's Pipeline Security Branch conducts security reviews to assess pipeline operators' implementation of TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines, but gaps in staffing and lack of a workforce plan may affect its ability to carry out effective reviews. The Pipeline Security Branch developed a pipeline risk assessment to rank relative risk of the top 100 critical pipeline systems and to prioritize its security reviews of pipeline companies, but shortfalls in its calculations of threat, vulnerability, and consequence may limit its ability to accurately identify pipeline systems with the highest risk. Finally, the pipeline risk assessment has not been peer reviewed to validate the assessment's data and methodology, which GAO previously reported as a best practice in risk management. TSA has established performance measures, as well as databases to monitor pipeline security reviews and analyze their results. However, weaknesses in its performance measures and its efforts to record pipeline security review recommendations limit its ability to determine the extent that its pipeline security program has reduced pipeline sector risks. For example, many of TSA's measures cover agency goals and mission, but they generally lack clarity and measurable targets, provide significantly overlapping information, and do not include baseline and trend data. Further, TSA has not tracked the implementation status of past recommendations for over 5 years and related security review data are not sufficiently reliable. Until TSA monitors and records the status of these reviews' recommendations, it will be hindered in its efforts to determine whether its recommendations are leading to significant reduction in risk. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that TSA (1) implement a documented process for reviewing, and if deemed necessary, revising its Pipeline Security Guidelines at regular defined intervals; (2) develop a strategic workforce plan for its Security Policy and Industry Engagement's Surface Division; (3) update the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to include up-to-date data; (4) fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions, and judgments that form the basis of the assessment; and (5) incorporate that data into the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to assess relative risk of critical pipeline systems. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-212": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD is responsible for approving contractor business systems that reduce risk to the government and taxpayer. In fiscal year 2017, DOD spent approximately $1.4 billion on contractor business systems. In fiscal year 2017, DCAA reported that it had a backlog of incomplete incurred cost audits. GAO was asked to review the CBS review process. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has clarified roles and responsibilities for conducting CBS reviews and (2) the extent to which DOD has a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DCMA and DCAA data; and interviewed officials from DCMA and DCAA. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken actions to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in conducting business system reviews and consolidate the number of reviews to be performed; clarify how often DOD should conduct business system reviews; establish what criteria are used to evaluate a contractor's business system; establish timeframes by which Administrative Contracting Officers (ACO) are to make a determination on the adequacy of the contractors' business systems; and implement the use of payment withholds for contractors that are found to have significant deficiencies in their contractor business systems. GAO's review of six selected contractors' business system reviews found that the whole process from the review or audit, to the follow up and resolution, can be lengthy. In three out of six selected cases GAO reviewed, it took 4 or more years for a contractor's system to be approved. DCMA and DCAA do not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner. DCAA's data show that it conducted few business system audits in the past 6 years, due, in part, to the need for it to reduce its backlog on completing incurred cost audits. Looking to the future, DCAA has developed plans for the number of CBS audits it intends to perform over the next 3 years and expects that it will be caught up in conducting the audits for which it is responsible by fiscal year 2022. Successfully executing its plan is dependent on several factors, including the ability to shift resources from conducting incurred cost audits to business systems audits, the use of public accounting firms to perform a portion of the incurred cost audits, and the ability of DCAA auditors to use new audit plans and complete the required audits in a timely manner. For its part, DCMA relies on the offices that perform the reviews of the three systems to maintain the information on the reviews completed and to plan for future reviews, but DCMA headquarters does not centrally track its reviews or whether audits conducted by DCAA are being completed within the timeframes described in policy. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DCMA, in collaboration with DCAA, develop a mechanism to monitor and assess whether contractor business system reviews are being completed in a timely manner. DOD agreed with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-76": "Why GAO Did This Study DOT has promulgated consumer protection regulations to enhance airline consumer protections since 2009, and DOT has taken steps to educate passengers about their rights. GAO was asked to review DOT's efforts to ensure airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements. This report examines (1) trends in DOT data on airline service from 2008 through 2017 and airlines' actions to improve service; (2) how effectively DOT ensures airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements; and (3) the extent to which DOT's airline passenger education efforts align with key practices for consumer outreach. GAO analyzed DOT data on airline service from 2008 through 2017 and interviewed DOT officials and representatives from 11 selected airlines. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed DOT officials. What GAO Found The Department of Transportation (DOT) data provide mixed information on whether service improved from 2008 through 2017. DOT requires reporting airlines to provide operational data, including information on late, cancelled, or diverted flights; mishandled baggage; and denied boardings. These data showed some general improvement in the quality of airline service from 2008 through 2017. However, during the same time period, the total number of passenger complaints filed with DOT increased for \"selected\" airlines. Moreover, while these data may be imperfect measures of service quality, they do provide some indication of the passenger experience. DOT publishes data on both operational performance and passengers' complaints in its monthly Air Travel Consumer Report to inform the public about the quality of services provided by airlines. DOT promotes and monitors airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements and deters noncompliance in five key ways, such as by reviewing passenger complaint data and taking enforcement action where it identifies violations. However, GAO found that DOT could improve its procedures to provide additional assurances that analysts consistently code passengers' complaints and properly identify potential consumer protection violations, in addition to more fully utilizing data from DOT's information systems to inform its compliance program. DOT has objectives for each of its five key compliance activities, but it lacks performance measures for three of these objectives. As a result, DOT is limited in its ability to assess progress toward achieving its goal of promoting airlines' compliance with consumer protection requirements or to identify and make any needed improvements. DOT has made recent improvements to its aviation consumer protection website, but its passenger education efforts do not fully align with key practices for consumer outreach. For example, DOT has successfully identified the goals and objectives of its passenger education program and identified the appropriate media mix for disseminating its materials. Similarly, GAO found that DOT had identified and engaged stakeholders, a step that, according to DOT officials, allowed them to better tailor materials. However, DOT's actions do not align with the key practice to \"identify resources\" and only partially align with the key practice to \"develop consistent, clear messages\" based on the established budget. Obtaining input directly from passengers on what information they want or what they know about their rights would provide DOT with greater assurance that educational materials are appropriately tailored to meet a wide range of passengers' needs. Finally, DOT has not established performance measures to understand the quality of its passenger education materials (i.e., process measures) or the effectiveness of its efforts (i.e., outcome measures). DOT officials said that they receive informal input from stakeholders on the quality of the materials and track website traffic to understand whether materials are reaching passengers. However, these mechanisms do not help it understand the quality of the materials and measure the success of its passenger education efforts. Establishing such measures would provide DOT with greater assurance that its educational efforts are appropriately tailored to passengers and leading to improved understanding of passengers' rights, including whether any adjustments are needed. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOT assess its procedures and training materials for coding passenger complaints, as appropriate, to help ensure that passengers' complaints are consistently coded and that potential consumer protection violations are properly identified. DOT concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-124": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States exported over $2 billion in tobacco and tobacco-related products in 2017. Congress has restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated for State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products since the 1990s. In fiscal year 2018, Congress altered the restriction language in the act making appropriations for State, which makes promotion activities permissive with respect to the use of State appropriations. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) the guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas, (2) to what extent overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) to what extent select U.S. agencies have implemented this guidance overseas. GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA. GAO also interviewed representatives of the tobacco control community and business associations. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) collaborate with each other to develop and periodically issue an interagency guidance cable to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. State officials draft the updated cable and Commerce, USDA, and other agency officials have the opportunity to review and comment on it before State issues it through its cable system. This cable serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions on promoting tobacco for their officials overseas. Commerce relies on both the interagency guidance cable as well as its client eligibility policy to implement restrictions on promoting tobacco. USDA relies on the interagency guidance cable to provide direction to its officials overseas, and does not have agency-specific guidance for implementing its permanent funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. USDA officials said that the cable sufficiently addresses the funding restrictions on the agency's promotion activities and helps to ensure that all officials serving at posts overseas conduct activities in a consistent manner. Most State, Commerce, and USDA officials overseas GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions on promoting tobacco and received some guidance concerning the restrictions, but many did not receive training about the restrictions. Officials in 21 of the 24 offices overseas GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions. The three offices that were not aware of the restrictions were from State. Although these officials were not aware of the restrictions, they said they had never provided services to U.S. tobacco companies. Commerce and USDA officials said the guidance concerning these restrictions has been consistent for many years and that staff in the field and in headquarters are very aware of the restrictions. Officials in 15 of the 24 offices overseas GAO interviewed said they did not receive any training concerning the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training, aimed at developing employee knowledge, skills, and abilities, is essential to an organization's operational success. If agencies do not explicitly include information about the restrictions and related guidance in training materials for officials conducting export promotion activities overseas, officials may work at a post for several months, or longer, before learning about the restrictions. Officials in 24 offices in nine countries and GAO's review of agency documents showed that posts have implemented the funding restrictions on tobacco as outlined in the interagency guidance cable issued by State. For example, post officials said they have not promoted the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products or attended events solely sponsored by tobacco companies, though many officials said they attended events at which officials from tobacco companies were present. Post officials identified three areas of the guidance that may benefit from additional clarification, according to GAO interviews with agency officials and GAO's review of agency emails. For example, officials raised questions about whether and when it is permissible to attend events at which tobacco company representatives are present. The guidance does not specifically address attendance at events also attended by representatives of tobacco companies. State headquarters officials said the vast majority of questions received from posts concern whether personnel at a post may participate in an event when representatives from a company engaged in the tobacco industry are also expected to participate in that event. Officials also asked for additional guidance about the types of services they are permitted to provide to tobacco companies or the types of companies or products they can support. For example, some officials asked whether they could engage with the host country government to obtain information about pending tobacco-related legislation at the request of a tobacco company. In addition, some officials also indicated that the current guidance lacks clarity on the types of services officials are allowed to provide to tobacco companies and what constitutes a tobacco product. More specific guidance would help ensure that State, Commerce, and USDA officials consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State and USDA work with the Foreign Service Institute to include information about the restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in its training materials",
    "gao_GAO-18-59": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard relies on EHRs to provide health care services to nearly 50,000 members throughout the United States. However, the agency has not implemented an EHR system since 2010, and the agency has been unable to return to managing health records using its legacy electronic capabilities. In 2010, the Coast Guard began an effort to expand the original EHR modernization effort to integrate other necessary and outdated services. In 2010, the Coast Guard awarded a $14 million contract to acquire a commercial off-the-shelf EHR system. However, the agency decided to terminate the project in October 2015, citing financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's management and oversight of the project. This report (1) describes what led the agency to the decision to terminate further development of the project, and how much was spent on the project; (2) evaluates the Coast Guard's management and oversight actions for the discontinued EHR modernization project and what, if any, lessons learned were identified; (3) describes the Coast Guard's current process for managing health records and the challenges, if any, it is encountering; and (4) determines the Coast Guard's plans for effectively implementing a new EHR system and the current status of its efforts. GAO reviewed relevant Coast Guard policies and guidance, surveyed 166 clinics and 125 sick bays, and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) abruptly discontinued the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS) project in October 2015, citing financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks. The Coast Guard ordered project management and contractor staff to cease work on IHiS until a determination was made regarding the antideficiency violation. In addition, the Director of HSWL provided GAO a written summary of information on the IHiS project risks that she said she had verbally communicated to the Executive Oversight Council (EOC) during meetings on September 24, 2015, and October 6, 2015. The Director and the related e-mail identified the following technical risks: Lack of testing. IHiS lacked an independent security assessment to verify that the system's security infrastructure was adequate. Limited system functionality. The system that was to provide user verification and IHiS role management services was not yet complete. Limited system functionality. The system that was to provide user verification and IHiS role management services was not yet complete. Changes in project management staff. Although HSWL staff had been managing the IHiS project since it was initiated in 2010, the Coast Guard's Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information Technology (C4&IT) Directorate was directed to assume the oversight responsibilities for IHiS implementation in May 2015 due to concerns about the project's adherence to established governance processes raised by internal investigators looking into the potential Antideficiency Act violations. By August 2015, the key project management personnel that had overseen the project since 2010 had been removed. As a result of the changes in staff, one vendor noted that it was unclear as to who were stakeholders, responsible parties, and decision makers. According to the Director, these risk factors had demonstrated that the project was far from ready for deployment and that continuing IHiS could cause significant stewardship and reputational harm to the Coast Guard. As a result of the risks presented by the Director, the EOC members made the decision to cancel IHiS, and did not consider any other alternatives to its cancelation. The Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it effectively managed and oversaw the IHiS project prior to its discontinuance. Specifically, although the Coast Guard was to follow the SDLC Practice Manual to guide its management and oversight of the project, the agency could not provide complete evidence that it had addressed 15 of the 30 selected project management practices GAO selected for evaluation. In addition, project team members provided inconsistent explanations regarding whether or not documentation existed to demonstrate the actions taken to manage and oversee the IHiS project. Further, although the Coast Guard developed charters for various governance boards to provide project oversight and direction, the boards were not active and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) was not included as a member of the boards, further contributing to a lack of key governance mechanisms for IHiS. Finally, the Coast Guard did not document and share lessons learned from the failed project to help prevent similar outcomes for future IT projects. The Coast Guard is managing its health records using a predominately paper process. After canceling the IHiS project in October 2015, the agency could not return to managing health records using its legacy electronic capabilities because the PGUI was decommissioned in 2015 and the Coast Guard's Composite Health Care System (CHCS) was decommissioned in January 2016. Thus, the Coast Guard directed clinics",
    "gao_GAO-18-303": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) provides grants to a variety of recipients, including state agencies, tribal governments, and nongovernmental organizations. In fiscal year 2016, FWS awarded $1.5 billion in grants, which was about 50 percent of the agency's total $2.9 billion budget authority. WSFR awards grants to a variety of recipients, including state agencies, tribal governments, and nongovernmental organizations. GAO was asked to review the award and monitoring processes for WSFR grants. This report (1) describes the competitive grant programs that WSFR awards and monitors; (2) examines how WSFR awards grants under these programs and the extent to which this is consistent with relevant federal regulations; and (3) examines how WSFR monitors grants under these programs and the extent to which this is consistent with relevant federal regulations. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, agency guidance, and agency policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed WSFR officials and grant applicants. What GAO Found The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration (WSFR) awards and monitors five competitive grant programs, according to agency documents and officials GAO interviewed. These five grant programs are (1) the Boating Infrastructure Tier 2 Grant Program, (2) the Clean Vessel Act Grant Program, (3) the Competitive State Wildlife Grant Program, (4) the Multistate Conservation Grant Program, and (5) the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. While these grant programs support different types of projects, they generally are funded from the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund, and most require non-federal matching funds from the grant recipient based on statute. The exceptions to this are the Multistate Conservation Grant Program, which also receives funds from the Wildlife Restoration Account and does not require matching funds, and the Competitive State Wildlife Grant Program, which receives funding from annual appropriations. The award process WSFR uses for the five competitive grant programs generally involves announcing the grant opportunity and reviewing applications to make award decisions, and in some cases federal agencies or third parties are involved in these activities. The award process used for the five competitive WSFR grant programs is generally consistent with federal grant regulations in the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). WSFR monitors its competitive grants primarily by reviewing annual financial and performance reports submitted by grant recipients, which is consistent with federal regulations. GAO found in its review of these reports for a sample of grant projects awarded funds in fiscal year 2015 that grant recipients generally submitted them on time, but that some performance reports were missing required information. WSFR staff review the financial reports to ensure they contain required information, such as an update on the progress of meeting the specified goals of a grant project. In addition, WSFR grant specialists review the performance reports to ensure they contain required information, such as an update on the progress of meeting the specified goals of a grant project. WSFR staff occasionally perform site visits to grant projects to verify grant activities described in the performance reports. In addition, GAO found in its review of the agency's monitoring process for selected grants awarded in fiscal year 2015 that WSFR required both financial and performance reports at least annually, as required by the Uniform Guidance. In addition, the number and due dates of these reports were specified in the letters provided to grant recipients when they were awarded the grant. These award letters also specified the amount of federal funding for the grant along with any required non-federal matching funds. GAO found in its review of the agency's monitoring process for selected grants awarded in fiscal year 2015 that WSFR required both financial and performance reports at least annually, as required by the Uniform Guidance. In addition, the majority of the reports GAO reviewed met the content requirements found in the Uniform Guidance and the FWS Service Manual. However, in GAO's review of the performance reports for six awarded grants, GAO found that the performance reports submitted for these grants did not include a comparison of actual accomplishments to the goals of the project, as required by the Uniform Guidance. Without a template or standardized method for performance reporting across competitive grant programs, WSFR grant recipients may continue to submit performance reports to WSFR that do not contain the information required by the Uniform Guidance and do not convey all the information needed for FWS to oversee its competitive grant programs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that WSFR develop a template or other standardized method to facilitate collection of all required information for grant performance reports. The Department of the Interior agreed with GAO's recommendation and described actions it plans to take.",
    "gao_GAO-18-648": "Why GAO Did This Study The Veterans First program, established in 2006, provides contracting preferences to small businesses that are owned and controlled by veterans. The Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that VA must restrict competition to SD/VOSBs if: 1) the contracting officer reasonably expects that at least two such businesses will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the government; and 2) the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the government. GAO was asked to examine changes to how VA implements the Veterans First program as a result of the Supreme Court's decision. This report examines (1) how VA procurement obligations to veteran-owned small businesses changed in the period from fiscal years 2014 through 2017; (2) what actions VA has taken to update Veterans First policies and regulations and provide training following the Supreme Court's decision; (3) what challenges, if any, VA is encountering in applying Veterans First policies; and (4) the extent to which VA has mechanisms in place to monitor compliance with subcontracting limitations by veteran-owned small businesses. GAO analyzed VA's policies and regulations, guidance, and training materials related to the program, and interviewed VA contracting officers and contracting officers' representatives. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has consistently set aside a much greater percentage of construction contracts and orders for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD/VOSB) than for other types of goods and services. The number of SD/VOSBs certified by VA also increased, as did the number of those firms that received contract awards. VA's 2016 Veterans First policy requires contracting officers to use the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) as the first step in market research to identify SD/VOSBs capable of performing the work. However, over three-quarters of the 35 contract files GAO reviewed did not contain such documentation. Such documentation, combined with support for overall market research efforts, provides VA with assurance that contracting officers have performed this search as part of the basis for their Rule of Two decision. Contracting officers also expressed confusion about how to determine whether the prices offered by SD/VOSBs in response to a set-aside solicitation are fair and reasonable. VA contracting officers are generally required to make this determination for every contract award. However, GAO found that many of the contracting officers GAO interviewed were uncertain how to balance the Veterans First preference with the determination of fair and reasonable price when lower prices were available on the open market. Contracting officers also expressed confusion about how to determine whether the prices offered by SD/VOSBs in response to a set-aside solicitation are fair and reasonable. VA contracting officers are generally aware of subcontracting limitations, but they told GAO they do not have sufficient time or knowledge to conduct oversight. VA conducts some audits of compliance through a separate program. While the scale of that effort has been limited, these audits have identified a number of violations. VA, however, has not shared subcontracting limitation compliance risks or practices to improve monitoring efforts. By conducting a comprehensive assessment of fraud risk, VA would be better positioned to detect potential fraud related to subcontracting limitations for the Veterans First program. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA take steps to ensure contracting officers adhere to the requirements for documenting the required Vendor Information Pages searches in contract files; assess whether training on the Veterans First policy should be designated as mandatory; and monitor subcontracting limitations. VA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-610": "Why GAO Did This Study The Great Lakes-Seaway system is a critical transportation link linking U.S. manufacturing, agricultural, and other industries in the nation's interior to the global economy. The system is managed by the Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) and the U.S. Seaway Corporation (U.S. Seaway Corporation). The Army Corps manages the Soo locks, which are critical to the system's ability to maintain the integrity of the Great Lakes' navigation infrastructure. The U.S. Seaway Corporation manages the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is primarily used by Canadian and foreign vessels. The U.S. Seaway Corporation manages the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is primarily used by Canadian and foreign vessels. GAO was asked to review the Great Lakes-Seaway system. This report examines (1) how Great Lakes-Seaway shipping trends have changed since 1980 and what factors have shaped recent trends, (2) selected stakeholders' perspectives on challenges to using the system, and (3) to what extent the agencies have made progress on lock infrastructure renewal efforts and how the agencies measure performance of these efforts. GAO analyzed Great Lakes-Seaway data from 1980 to 2016 and interviewed 24 stakeholders representing a range of traditional and emerging system users and experts. What GAO Found The amount of cargo transported annually on the Great Lakes-Seaway\u2014specifically for U.S. Great Lakes domestic and Seaway cargo\u2014has generally declined since 1980. The Great Lakes U.S. domestic \u201claker\u201d cargo traffic declined from about 115 million tons in 1980 to about 78 million tons in 2016. The trend includes many noticeable year-to-year changes over this time period, which may be in response to broader economic factors, such as global economic factors. Meanwhile, cargo traffic on the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is primarily used by Canadian and foreign vessels, declined by 48 percent over the same time period, from about 74 million tons in 1980 to about 39 million tons in 2016. Stakeholders identified a range of challenges to using the Great Lakes-Seaway, including challenges to traditional system use, such as transport of bulk commodities such as iron ore, and challenges to emerging system uses, such as the cruise industry and container market. The U.S. Seaway Corporation has not fully assessed the extent to which the challenges pose risks to the use of the Great Lakes-Seaway. The U.S. Seaway Corporation has taken steps to improve the condition of lock infrastructure, but it has not fully assessed the risks to the system's use. The U.S. Seaway Corporation has taken steps to address challenges, such as hiring a full-time employee to advance the Corporation's trade and economic development activities in the Great Lakes region. However, the Corporation has not fully assessed the extent to which the challenges pose risks to the system's use. The U.S. Seaway Corporation and the Army Corps have made progress on asset renewal efforts, but the Army Corps lacks a specific operational goal or measures for the Soo locks. The U.S. Seaway Corporation has a lock performance goal and measure that officials use to monitor its asset renewal efforts, in accordance with government internal control standards, but the Army Corps does not have such a goal specific to the Soo locks. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that agencies should define objectives clearly and in measurable terms so that performance toward achieving those objectives can be assessed. Similarly, Leading Practices in Capital Decision-Making states that organizational goals should be integrated into the capital decision-making process and that agencies should use performance measures to evaluate results of capital projects to determine if goals have been met. Without goals and associated measures for the Soo locks, the Army Corps is not able to demonstrate whether the substantial investments made so far and planned in the future will improve the Soo locks' performance and by extension, the reliability of the Great Lakes navigation infrastructure. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Administrator of the U.S. Seaway Corporation establish a process to identify, analyze, and monitor risks to the system's use to inform future actions to address those risks. The Departments of Transportation and Defense concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-57": "Why GAO Did This Study The Commercial Space Launch Act provides federal indemnification for third-party damages that result from a commercial launch or reentry. The act requires FAA to evaluate its MPL methodology incorporating three requirements, but the agency's report did not fully address these requirements. GAO was asked to review FAA's MPL methodology. This report examines the extent to which FAA has (1) addressed the act's mandated requirements and (2) revised its MPL methodology since GAO's 2012 report. GAO reviewed FAA's MPL methodology and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed FAA's MPL methodology and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not fully address the Commercial Space Launch Act's (CSLCA) mandated requirements for evaluating its MPL methodology. CSLCA required FAA to evaluate its MPL methodology incorporating three requirements, but the agency's report did not fully address these requirements. First, the act required FAA to ensure a balance of risk between launch companies and the federal government. However, agency officials told GAO that they did not re-evaluate the probability thresholds\u2014which are used to divide the risk of loss between launch companies and the federal government\u2014as part of evaluating its MPL methodology when implementing the risk profile method due to resource constraints. Second, the act required FAA to consider the cost impact of implementing an updated MPL methodology, but the agency did not evaluate the impact of implementing its revised methodology on the direct costs to launch companies (insurance premiums) and to the federal government (indemnification liability). Third, the act required FAA to consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL, but they did not consult such parties in response to the act. Without fully addressing CSLCA's mandated requirements, FAA cannot ensure that the federal government is not exposed to greater liability costs than intended or that launch companies are not required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary. FAA has taken steps designed to improve two of three elements of its MPL methodology, including revising its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a given launch and changing the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, the agency has not updated the third element, the amount it uses for the cost of an individual casualty, leaving a previously identified weakness unaddressed. In March 2017, GAO reported that FAA had taken steps to address weaknesses in two of these three areas. Specifically, FAA revised its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a given launch and changed the factor it uses to derive estimated property damage from estimated casualties. However, the agency has not updated the third element, the amount it uses for the cost of an individual casualty, leaving a previously identified weakness unaddressed. In March 2017, GAO also reported that there are instances where deriving estimated property damage from estimated casualty costs is inappropriate. As of November 2017, FAA does not have guidance to identify such instances or to guide decisions on which tools to use in developing the MPL estimate. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FAA (1) reevaluate the probability thresholds, (2) evaluate the cost impact of implementing its revised MPL methodology, (3) consult with the commercial space sector and insurance providers in evaluating its MPL, and (4) update the cost-of-casualty amount. FAA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-701T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a long-standing interest in removing foreign nationals from the United States. In fiscal year 2013, the ATD program, which aims to remove foreign nationals from the United States who are awaiting final decisions on their immigration proceedings, was the largest program in the federal government. In fiscal year 2013, ICE reported that the ATD program had a total of 73,495 removals of foreign nationals. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which the ATD program has addressed GAO's prior recommendations and (2) the extent to which ICE established performance measures to assess the ATD program's effectiveness. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports issued from June 2005 through June 2017 and selected updates conducted in February 2018. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DHS officials, experts, and stakeholders. What GAO Found GAO reported in June 2017 that the number of open cases before the court during a single fiscal year grew 44 percent from fiscal years 2006 through 2015 due to an increase in the case backlog, while case receipts remained steady and the immigration courts completed fewer cases. GAO also reported in June 2017 that EOIR's case backlog more than doubled from fiscal years 2006 through 2015 due to an increase in the case backlog, while case receipts remained steady and the immigration courts completed fewer cases. GAO also reported in June 2017 that EOIR has faced long-standing management and operational challenges. In particular, GAO identified challenges related to EOIR's workforce planning, hiring, and technology utilization, among other things. GAO recommended actions to improve EOIR's management in these areas. EOIR generally concurred and has initiated actions to address GAO's recommendations. However, EOIR needs to take additional steps to fully implement GAO's recommendations to help strengthen the agency's management and reduce the case backlog. In November 2014, GAO reported that the ATD program increased and costs less than detention. For example, the average daily cost of the ATD program was $10.55 in fiscal year 2013, while the average daily cost of detention was $158. While GAO's analyses showed that the ATD program was significantly less than the average daily cost of detention, the length of immigration proceedings affected the cost-effectiveness of the ATD program to varying extents under different scenarios. For example, GAO found that the ATD program would have surpassed the cost of detention after a foreign national was in the program for 1,229 days in fiscal year 2013\u2014significantly longer than the average length of time foreign nationals spent in the ATD program in that year (383 days). GAO also reported in November 2014 that ICE established two program performance measures to assess the ATD program's effectiveness in (1) ensuring foreign national compliance with court appearance requirements and (2) ensuring removals from the United States, but limitations in data collection hindered ICE's ability to assess overall program performance. For example, ICE did not collect court compliance data for foreign nationals in the ATD program that ICE was responsible for managing\u2014which accounted for 39 percent of the overall ATD program in fiscal year 2013. As a result, GAO recommended that ICE collect and report data on all available data on the majority of foreign nationals in both components of the ATD program. ICE agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-487": "Why GAO Did This Study CBP is responsible for securing the U.S. border between ports of entry and responding to threats to the United States in the air and maritime environments at and beyond the border. CBP has taken steps to improve its recruitment, hiring, and retention of law enforcement officers, including increasing the number of applications it receives for these positions and reducing the amount of time it takes to hire applicants. GAO was asked to review CBP's hiring process. This report examines (1) the extent to which CBP has enhanced its recruitment efforts and applications for law enforcement officer positions and (2) the extent to which CBP has taken steps to retain qualified law enforcement personnel. GAO reviewed CBP's hiring process and recruitment budgets, interviewed CBP officials, and analyzed CBP data on attrition and retention. GAO also reviewed CBP data on the number of Border Patrol agent and CBP officer positions and interviewed CBP officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has increased its emphasis on recruitment and increased the number of recruitment events it has participated in since fiscal year 2015. Specifically, CBP more than tripled the total number of recruitment events it participated in, from 905 events in fiscal year 2015 to roughly 3,000 in both fiscal years 2016 and 2017. CBP has also increased its use of recruitment incentives, such as retention and relocation incentives, to help staff hard-to-fill locations. CBP officials stated that recruitment incentives have been effective in filling staffing shortages at hard-to-fill locations. CBP has also increased its use of recruitment incentives, although use by components varied. CBP has taken steps to improve its hiring process for law enforcement officers, but the process remains lengthy. CBP has made efforts to improve its hiring process by revising certain aspects of the process and piloting two key hiring initiatives\u2014Hiring Hub events and the Applicant Care program. According to CBP officials, these efforts have collectively resulted in the decreased time-to-hire and increased overall applicant pass rates for all three components. In addition, CBP's contract with Accenture Federal Services, LLC, is intended to enhance CBP's ability to achieve its primary goal\u2014hiring law enforcement officers to meet target staffing levels\u2014by augmenting CBP's current hiring infrastructure and pursuing new and innovative hiring initiatives. CBP has enhanced its retention efforts, but does not have a systematic process for capturing and analyzing information on departing law enforcement officers. CBP officials across all three operational components confirmed that they do not systematically conduct formal exit interviews to collect data on departing employees. CBP officials across all three components told GAO that departing law enforcement officers receive the DHS exit survey and therefore have the option to provide these data. However, CBP officials told GAO that this information was of limited value due to low response rates. Taking steps to ensure that the agency's operational components are systematically capturing and analyzing complete and accurate information on all departing law enforcement officers\u2014including the factors that influenced their decision to separate\u2014would better position CBP to understand its retention challenges and take appropriate action to address them. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CBP systematically collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement officers and use this information to inform retention efforts. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-163": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government provides about $3.5 billion in federal student aid annually to about 1.4 million borrowers. The CDR is intended to hold schools accountable for borrowers who default on their student loans during the first 3 years of repayment. The CDR is also intended to hold schools accountable for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans during the first 3 years of repayment. GAO was asked to review the extent to which schools and their default management consultants use to manage their CDRs. This report examines (1) how schools work with borrowers to manage their CDRs, and how these strategies affect borrowers and schools' accountability for defaults; and (2) the extent to which Education oversees the strategies schools and their default management consultants use to manage schools' CDRs and informs the public about its efforts to hold schools accountable. GAO analyzed data from Education for the most recent CDR cohorts for a population of over 4,000 schools, reviewed documentation from default management consultants, and interviewed Education officials and student loan experts. What GAO Found Some schools' default management consultants encourage borrowers to postpone loan payments through forbearance, even when better borrower options may be available. Some consultants have an incentive to encourage forbearance in particular as a strategy to prevent borrowers from defaulting within the 3-year cohort calculation. This is because forbearance keeps borrowers current on their loans, and borrowers would not go into default until they had made no payments for an additional 360 days after the forbearance period ended. Moreover, including borrowers who spend 18 months or more in forbearance in the CDR calculation reduces the CDR's ability to hold schools accountable for high default rates since long periods of forbearance appear to delay\u2014not prevent\u2014default for some borrowers. Absent a statutory change, schools and their consultants seeking to keep CDRs below allowable thresholds will continue to have an incentive to promote forbearance over other repayment and postponement options. The Department of Education (Education) plays an important role in overseeing schools and their default management consultants to ensure that they are held accountable and student loan borrowers are protected. However, because Education asserts that it lacks explicit statutory authority to establish requirements regarding the information that schools and consultants provide to borrowers after they leave school, Education does not hold them accountable for providing accurate and complete information about repayment and postponement options. In addition, public information on CDR sanctions is important for assessing the usefulness of the CDR to hold schools accountable. Yet, Education's practice of reporting the number of schools potentially subject to sanction without reporting the number of schools ultimately sanctioned following the appeals process limits transparency about the CDR's usefulness for Congress and the public. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Congress consider strengthening schools' accountability for student loan defaults by revising the CDR calculation to account for the effect of borrowers spending long periods of time in forbearance during the 3-year CDR period, specifying additional accountability measures to complement the CDR, or replacing the CDR with a different accountability measure. Education agreed with GAO's draft report and disagreed with the draft report's recommendation. GAO continues to believe that Education should require that schools and consultants provide borrowers with accurate and complete information about repayment and postponement options after they leave school.",
    "gao_GAO-18-52": "Why GAO Did This Study FEHBP is a federal-state health insurance program that provides health insurance coverage to about 8 million FEHBP enrollees. The program is administered by OPM, which is responsible for negotiating health benefits and premiums with carriers. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines (1) the number of plan offerings available to FEHBP enrollees and the extent to which these offerings have changed over time, (2) the extent to which FEHBP market shares have changed over time, and (3) the extent to which stakeholders have expressed their views about the potential effects of expanding OPM's contracting authority. GAO analyzed FEHBP enrollment data from 2000 through 2015, reviewed relevant studies, and interviewed OPM officials and 10 stakeholders selected based on a variety of factors, including enrollment, premiums, and market shares. GAO also interviewed officials from OPM and FEHBP carriers. What GAO Found The number of plan offerings available to FEHBP enrollees generally increased from 2007 through 2015. In 99 percent of counties nationwide, enrollees had more plan offerings in 2015 than they had in 2007. The median number of plan offerings available in a county increased from 19 in 2007 to 24 in 2015. Most of these offerings were the nationwide fee-for-service (FFS) plans that are available in all counties. There were 17 such plan offerings in 2007 and 19 in 2015. The remaining plan offerings were health maintenance organization (HMO) plans that were available in more limited areas. Despite increases in the availability of the median number of HMO plan offerings in a county, there was wide variation in the number of HMO offerings available to enrollees in a given county. For example, while FFS plan offerings were available nationwide, in some counties enrollees had no HMO plan offerings. Since 2007, however, the number of counties without any HMO plan offerings declined from 18 percent to less than 2 percent in 2015. Most counties had a couple of HMO plan offerings, and some counties had at least 10 HMO offerings. The combined market share for the three largest FEHBP carriers in a state was generally similar to the large group market and higher than Medicare Advantage. The combined market share for the three largest FEHBP carriers in a state was generally similar to the large group market and higher than Medicare Advantage. Stakeholder opinions and cost estimates do not offer clear consensus about the potential effects of expanding the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) contracting authority. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally supported expanding OPM's contracting authority to allow it to contract with a greater variety of health plan types than are currently offered in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). However, the two stakeholders that offer nationwide FFS plans and 1 stakeholder that represents federal employees opposed it. Most of the concerns expressed by these 3 stakeholders were related specifically to the potential effects of adding regional PPO plans to FEHBP. For example, 5 of these 6 stakeholders said there could be instability and higher premiums in FEHBP if new regional PPO plans were able to \"cherry pick\" low-cost areas in which to participate. Additionally, 6 of the 10 stakeholders GAO interviewed and who commented on OPM's contracting authority said that adding regional PPO plans to FEHBP would have positive effects. For example, 1 of these stakeholders that offers HMO plans and referred to FEHBP's plan type labels as antiquated noted that this would enable them to promote their existing FEHBP products\u2014currently categorized as HMO plans\u2014more appropriately as regional PPO plans. Stakeholders GAO interviewed and who commented on OPM's contracting authority, however, said that adding regional PPO plans to FEHBP would have negative effects. For example, 5 of these 6 stakeholders said there could be instability and higher premiums in FEHBP if new regional PPO plans were able to \"cherry pick\" low-cost areas in which to participate. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-254": "Why GAO Did This Study Fintech firms\u2014such as mobile wallets and financial account aggregators\u2014offer financial products and services to consumers through the Internet or via mobile devices. Fintech firms can provide consumers with various benefits, such as greater convenience and lower costs, but may also pose risks to consumers. GAO was asked to review the regulatory environment for fintech. This report examines (1) the benefits and risks of fintech activities and (2) the extent to which these activities are subject to federal oversight. GAO reviewed relevant literature and regulatory documents, and interviewed federal and state regulators, market participants, and other stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. What GAO Found Fintech products in payments, lending, wealth management, and distributed ledger technology can provide consumers and the broader financial system with various benefits but may also pose risks similar to those of traditional products. Consumer benefits include greater convenience; lower cost; increased financial inclusion; faster services; and improved security. However, consumers face the risk of unauthorized transactions regardless of whether they use a traditional or fintech firm to make payments. Fintech products also pose risks to consumers, including fraud, discrimination, and unsuitable advice. For example, consumers may face the risk of financial loss due to data breaches regardless of whether they use a traditional or fintech firm. Fintech firms are subject to federal oversight of their compliance with applicable consumer or other laws. Fintech firms that offer investment advice typically register with and are subject to examinations by federal securities regulators. Some fintech firms providing payments or loans that have partnered with federally regulated banks or credit unions may receive indirect oversight from federal financial regulators as part of their efforts to ensure that their regulated entities are adequately managing the risks of these arrangements. Nonpartnered fintech firms would not typically be subject to routine examinations by a federal financial regulator but would instead be subject to state regulatory oversight and enforcement. While regulatory oversight is fragmented across multiple regulators at the federal level, GAO found that indications of fintech firms causing widespread harm were limited as they were subject to fewer complaints than large financial institutions. The complexity of the U.S. financial regulatory system can complicate fintech firms' ability to identify the laws with which they must comply and clarify the regulatory status of their activities. For example, understanding the laws and regulations that apply to fintech firms was not easy because existing regulations were sometimes developed before the type of product or service they are now offering existed. In addition, the cost of researching applicable laws and regulations can be particularly significant for fintech firms that begin as technology start-ups with small staffs and limited venture capital funding. Also, federal agencies could improve collaboration and clarify issues related to financial account aggregation by making sure that interagency efforts dedicated to fintech include all relevant participants and incorporate other leading practices. In addition, because banks are liable for risks posed by third parties, fintech firms may face delays in entering into partnerships with banks.

    "gao_GAO-18-116": "Why GAO Did This Study The Kissell Amendment, enacted in 2009, requires DHS to purchase uniforms made in the United States. The amendment also requires DHS to apply the Kissell Amendment in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements. The amendment also requires GAO to review DHS's implementation and compliance with the Kissell Amendment. This report examines the extent to which (1) DHS has incorporated the Kissell Amendment into its procurement policies and procedures and (2) the Kissell Amendment affects DHS's procurement of textiles. GAO reviewed relevant laws and policies, DHS and component-level contracts, and ordering data for the largest textile contract since the effective date of the Kissell Amendment. GAO also interviewed DHS and U.S. textile and apparel industry officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) updated its procurement regulations to incorporate the Kissell Amendment restriction on the procurement of textiles from foreign sources. Since then, DHS inserted language incorporating the restriction into the 11 uniform and body armor contracts GAO reviewed. The HSAR establishes standardized DHS policies for all procurement activities within the department; according to DHS officials, all DHS components are to follow these policies. Pursuant to the Kissell Amendment, the restriction on the procurement of textiles became effective for DHS on August 16, 2009. One day later, DHS published an interim rule with a request for comments from the public that amended relevant Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation sections to reflect the statutory change limiting the procurement of products containing textiles from sources outside the United States (i.e., the Kissell Amendment). On June 9, 2010, after receiving comments from the public, DHS adopted the amendments issued under the interim rule as final and without change. The amended sections detail the restriction on procurements of foreign textiles. They also provide a list of the types of textile items included in the restriction (i.e., yarn, wool, cotton), the exceptions noted in the Kissell Amendment, and provide detail on the specific application of trade agreements. DHS employs multiple procedures, according to officials, in an effort to ensure that the Kissell Amendment is properly applied, including (1) a standardized procurement contract review process; (2) a requirement for all DHS components to use established department-wide contracts; (3) verification procedures to ensure the stated country of origin is correct; and (4) trainings on foreign procurement restrictions. The Kissell Amendment affects DHS textile purchases in a limited manner due to multiple factors. For most DHS components, these factors limit the effect of the Kissell Amendment restriction to certain foreign textile procurements directly related to U.S. national security interests that fall between $150,000 and $191,000. Specifically, from October 2009 to June 2017, only 14 DHS-awarded textile contracts, excluding the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), fell within this range, according to FPDS-NG data. TSA textile procurements, unlike most DHS components, are excluded from the coverage of most U.S. international agreements. Therefore, the Kissell Amendment restricts TSA's procurement of certain foreign textiles above $150,000 from all but three foreign countries. According to DHS officials, the current contracts to which the Kissell Amendment applies are department-wide contracts for uniforms and body armor. As of June 2017, under the current uniforms contract, 58 percent of the value of ordered uniform items by DHS came from foreign sources. In addition, DHS officials stated that the current body armor contracts source all textile items from the United States. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-150": "Why GAO Did This Study The MTW demonstration is a multiyear, multibillion-dollar demonstration to identify successful approaches to public housing that can be applied nationwide. The demonstration is on the brink of significant expansion, but HUD does not yet have the people, data, and processes in place to effectively oversee agency participants and assess the demonstration's performance and effects on tenants. GAO was asked to review HUD's oversight of the demonstration. This report examines (1) HUD's efforts to improve oversight of the demonstration and (2) the extent to which HUD has a framework for monitoring the demonstration's effect on tenants. GAO reviewed HUD documents and interviewed HUD officials and MTW agencies. GAO also reviewed HUD's guidance and data on the demonstration's effect on tenants. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has taken steps to improve oversight of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration, but has not conducted workforce planning for the demonstration expansion. HUD has taken some steps to improve MTW agencies' annual reporting and its process for monitoring compliance with requirements of the demonstration. However, GAO found that HUD's oversight\u2014review of annual reports and compliance assessments\u2014has not been timely and HUD has not fully documented its process for assessing compliance, due to limited staffing and competing priorities. While the MTW Office added staff to assist with the oversight of the current 39 MTW agencies, HUD has not conducted workforce planning to address the resources needed for overseeing the 100 agencies to be added through the MTW demonstration expansion. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including management of human capital, to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Without strategic workforce planning that reflects the oversight strategy for the expanded MTW demonstration, identifies the critical skills and competencies needed, and includes strategies to address any gaps, HUD will not be able to reasonably ensure that it has the staffing resources necessary to oversee an expanded demonstration. GAO found significant differences between MTW agencies and comparable non-MTW agencies in key outcomes: MTW agencies had lower public housing occupancy rates, lower voucher unit utilization rates, and higher program expenses in 2009\u20132015 than comparable non-MTW agencies. MTW funding flexibilities may partly explain the differences, but limitations in HUD data (such as the inability to determine which funding source was used to fund which activity) make it difficult to more fully understand the differences. MTW agencies accumulated relatively large reserves of voucher funding, but HUD has performed limited oversight of reserves for these agencies. HUD does not have a framework\u2014standard definitions for rent reform and self-sufficiency, clear guidance on reporting requirements, or analysis plans\u2014for monitoring the effect of rent-reform, work-requirement, and time-limit policies on tenants. HUD's definition of rent reform is unclear, leading to agencies inconsistently categorizing some policies and not reporting required information for rent-reform activities. Federal internal control standards state that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without a more clear definition of rent reform and specific criteria or standards with which to classify activities as rent reform, HUD cannot collect consistent information that would allow for the evaluation of the effect of MTW rent-reform and occupancy policies on tenants. HUD's guidance on how agencies are to perform impact analyses, reevaluate activities, and establish hardship policies has not described the elements of the analysis, required submission of reevaluations, or described elements of hardship policies. Federal internal control standards state that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without a more clear definition of rent reform and specific criteria or standards with which to classify activities as rent reform, HUD cannot collect consistent information that would allow for the evaluation of the effect of MTW rent-reform and occupancy policies on tenants. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HUD complete workforce planning for the MTW demonstration, develop and implement a process to monitor MTW reserves, and clarify its definition of rent reform. HUD agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-171": "Why GAO Did This Study Emergency communications are vital to first responders' ability to respond to emergencies and to ensure their safety. OEC supports and promotes the ability of public-safety officials to communicate in emergencies and work toward operable and interoperable emergency communications nationwide. In November 2018, legislation was signed into law that reorganized and renamed OEC. This report examines (1) OEC's and FEMA's collaborative efforts to develop and implement guidance for grantees using federal grants for interoperable emergency communications; (2) how OEC incorporates FirstNet's nationwide public-safety broadband network and other emerging technologies into its plans and offerings, and stakeholders' views regarding those efforts; and (3) the extent to which OEC has assessed its methods of communication. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed OEC officials and stakeholders. GAO also surveyed all 54 statewide interoperability coordinators (SWIC) from 48 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. What GAO Found The Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have responsibilities for developing and implementing guidance for grantees using federal funds for interoperable emergency communications. Specifically, OEC and FEMA officials told GAO FEMA is responsible for administering the grants, and OEC coordinates emergency communications grant guidance annually through SAFECOM's Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants. GAO reviewed OEC's and FEMA's collaborative efforts related to grant guidance and found that their efforts generally follow GAO's previously identified leading practices for effective interagency collaboration. For example, OEC and FEMA officials said they collaborate with their grants offices to develop guidance and share information. OEC officials said the agencies have not implemented the monitoring procedures because the grants for the 2018 grant cycle were not yet awarded. Accordingly, GAO could not evaluate the effectiveness of the new procedures to monitor and assess grantee compliance, and without conducting such an evaluation, GAO could not determine whether OEC's and FEMA's efforts align with the key practice in this area. OEC incorporated FirstNet's network and other emerging technologies into its plans and offerings. For example, OEC officials said that they provide stakeholders with a wide range of products and services to help prepare for the adoption, integration, and use of broadband. However, OEC officials told GAO that FirstNet's network is only one of several emergency-communications technology options and that OEC should continue to provide information to public-safety stakeholders regarding other providers. OEC officials said that they maintain a neutral position for all technologies and vendors. Accordingly, OEC is not responsible for promoting any vendor solutions, including FirstNet's network, and there is no requirement for OEC to do so. Additionally, the majority of SWICs that GAO surveyed said that OEC sufficiently incorporates information regarding FirstNet's network into its guidance and offerings. For example, officials from 6 of 10 organizations that GAO interviewed said that OEC must strike a balance between FirstNet's network and other emerging technologies, and that OEC has successfully accomplished this task. In addition, the majority of SWICs that GAO surveyed reported that OEC has incorporated FirstNet's network, to a large or moderate extent, into its written guidance, technical assistance offerings, training opportunities, workshops, and grant guidance. However, fewer SWICs reported that OEC incorporated FirstNet's network, to a large or moderate extent, into its training opportunities (39 percent) and grant guidance (33 percent). Even following the implementation of FirstNet, public-safety stakeholders told GAO they expect OEC will play an important role in ensuring interoperable emergency communications, both regarding the FirstNet network and other technologies. OEC is required to conduct extensive nationwide outreach to support and promote interoperable emergency-communications capabilities by state, regional, local, and tribal governments and public-safety agencies in the event of natural disasters and acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters. According to federal standards for internal control, management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. This includes communicating with external parties and using the appropriate methods of communication. The federal standards state that management should periodically assess the entity's methods of communication so that the entity has the appropriate tools to communicate quality information throughout and outside of the entity on a timely basis. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OEC assess its methods of communication to help ensure it has the appropriate tools and approaches to communicate quality information to public-safety stakeholders, and as appropriate, make adjustments to its communications strategy. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-287": "Why GAO Did This Study RRB provides disability benefits to railroad workers who have physical or mental impairments that prevent them from performing their specific railroad job, even though they may be able to perform other kinds of work. RRB also conducts continuing disability reviews (CDR) to determine if beneficiaries continue to meet the disability requirements of the law. GAO was asked to review RRB's CDR program. This report examines (1) the extent to which RRB conducts CDR, (2) the number of CDR completed and the number of overpayments identified, and (3) the extent to which RRB oversees its CDR program. GAO reviewed RRB data and policies, interviewed RRB officials, and analyzed RRB data for fiscal years 2014-2016. What GAO Found The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) completed 427 CDRs during fiscal years 2014-2016, an average of about 35,000, including both occupational and total and permanent (T&P) disability beneficiaries. Most of the reviews it completed were medical CDRs, but earnings CDRs identified most of the ineligible beneficiaries and overpayments. RRB completed 43 medical CDRs for beneficiaries, about 0.1 percent of disability beneficiaries, and 43 CDRs for earnings CDRs. RRB developed criteria for conducting additional medical CDRs to target cases at high risk for potential fraud, but these CDRs identified no ineligible beneficiaries in two years. Earnings CDRs identified the greatest number of ineligible beneficiaries and overpayments, but outdated earnings information limits their effectiveness. RRB completed 163 earnings CDRs during fiscal years 2014-2016, but the data RRB provided for these CDRs were incomplete. RRB officials acknowledged delays of a year or more in calculating overpayments for disability beneficiaries identified by CDRs, and that RRB lacks a standard time frame for doing so. RRB has no plans to establish a standard time frame for processing overpayments identified through CDRs. Identifying and calculating overpayments in a timely manner are important to RRB's long-term performance goal related to payment accuracy, as outlined in its strategic plan. RRB's oversight of its CDR program has focused on high-risk reviews rather than overall program data. RRB officials said they plan to track certain annual measures for high-risk CDRs, such as the number of cases referred to the Office of Inspector General for potential fraud, CDR outcomes (continuances, suspensions, and terminations), and any overpayments identified. GAO's findings and the Program Evaluation and Management Services' 2016 conclusions indicate that these high-risk CDRs have not been effective in identifying ineligible beneficiaries, or identifying potential fraud. By continuing to conduct high-risk CDRs, RRB may be expending resources that could be used for other purposes that are more effective in identifying ineligible beneficiaries. RRB does not routinely analyze program data for its CDR operations as a whole. The lack of routine data collection and analysis limits its ability to identify potential gaps in oversight and monitor program performance. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that RRB develop a standard for the timely processing of disability program overpayments identified through CDRs, consider whether to reallocate resources used for high-risk CDRs to other CDR efforts that produce more effective outcomes, and routinely analyze CDR program data, such as the number of cases selected for review, the number of beneficiaries in each medical improvement category, outcomes, and the costs and benefits of conducting CDRs, to improve program oversight. RRB agreed with all three recommendations and noted that it has already taken initial steps to implement them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-676T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars annually to support a wide range of programs and activities. The federal government has a long history of distributing federal funds to support a wide range of programs and activities. GAO has designated federal grants management as a governmentwide high-risk area since 2003. In this statement, GAO discusses (1) the challenges federal agencies face in managing grants, (2) the benefits of collaboration and consultation, and (3) the effectiveness of internal controls and oversight in managing federal grants. This statement is based on GAO's body of work on federal grants management, including GAO's work on the design and implementation of merit-based grant award selection and initiatives to manage for results across the federal government. GAO's work has included reviews of federal grant programs, agency internal controls, and related documents. GAO also interviewed officials from federal agencies, state and local governments, and nongovernmental grant participants. What GAO Found GAO's work has shown that when grants management requirements are duplicative, unnecessarily burdensome, and conflicting, agencies must direct resources toward meeting them\u2014which can make the agency's programs and services less cost effective and increase burden for grant recipients. GAO has also reported on a number of initiatives intended to address the challenges grantees encounter throughout the grants lifecycle. These initiatives include consolidating and revising grants management circulars, simplifying the pre-award phase, promoting shared information technology solutions for grants management, and improving the timeliness of grant closeout and reducing undisbursed balances. GAO's work has also shown that the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a pilot program to develop recommendations for reducing reporting burden for recipients of federal awards. GAO made a number of recommendations to improve the design of the Section 5 Pilot to ensure its consistency with leading practices for pilot design, which OMB has implemented. GAO continues to monitor implementation of the Section 5 Pilot through ongoing work and look forward to keeping the subcommittee informed about its findings. Transparency of grant spending can inform decision making. GAO's prior work has shown that numerous federal grant programs created over time without coordinated purposes and scope can result in grants management challenges. Addressing these challenges may achieve cost savings and result in greater efficiencies in grant programs. GAO's work has underscored the importance of identifying fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in a number of federal programs, including grants management practices. GAO's prior work has shown that when awarding and managing federal grants, effective oversight and internal control is important to provide reasonable assurance to federal managers and taxpayers that grants are awarded properly, recipients are eligible, and federal grant funds are used as intended and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. GAO's work has identified weaknesses in grants oversight and accountability issues that span the government including undisbursed grant award balances, single audit submissions that are late, and significant levels of improper payments in grant programs. Recent and proposed legislative- and executive-sponsored initiatives aimed at grants management reform present opportunities to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of federal grants. GAO's work on the design and implementation of merit-based grant award selection and initiatives to manage for results across the federal government has highlighted a number of key features necessary to effectively implement such crosscutting initiatives. Those features include: Establishing implementation goals and tracking progress. GAO's work highlighted the importance of establishing an implementation schedule and tracking progress toward priorities to help pinpoint performance shortfalls and suggest midcourse corrections, including any needed adjustments to future priorities and milestones. Identifying and agreeing on leadership roles and responsibilities. GAO's work has shown that when interagency councils clarify who will do what, identify how to organize their joint and individual efforts, and articulate steps for decision making, they enhance their ability to work together and achieve results. Developing an effective communication strategy. GAO reported on the importance of two-way communication that allows for feedback from relevant stakeholders. GAO also reported on the importance of two-way communication that allows for feedback from relevant stakeholders. Given the number and diversity of grantor agencies and grantmaking programs, GAO believes it is important that any grant reform initiative integrate with other government-wide reform efforts on related issues. One such reform initiative is the Presidential Memorandum (PMA), which lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government and improving the ability of agencies to achieve results. The PMA identified a set of CAP goals to target areas where multiple agencies must collaborate to effect change and report progress in a manner the public can easily track.

    "gao_GAO-18-652": "Why GAO Did This Study IHS provides health care services to members of federally recognized AI/AN tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS operates 168 service units, 48 hospitals, and 560 ambulatory care centers\u2014including health centers, school health centers, health stations, and Alaska village clinics. IHS has agreements with tribes and tribal organizations by which it transfers a substantial portion of its budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations. In 2017, IHS transferred approximately 54 percent of its total budget authority to tribes and tribal organizations to operate part or all of their own health care programs through self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. GAO was asked to review the effects of CRs on IHS. This report examines (1) the extent to which IHS has advance appropriation authority, (2) the effects of CRs on the provision of IHS-funded health care services, and (3) considerations for policymakers related to providing advance appropriation authority to IHS. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed IHS officials, tribal representatives, and other stakeholders. GAO also interviewed VA and IHS officials and tribal representatives. What GAO Found The Indian Health Service (IHS) has advance appropriation authority for certain health care programs, including its Indian health services and Indian health facilities accounts. IHS does not have this authority, but Congress has enacted longer periods of availability for certain IHS appropriations that would allow the activities they support to continue during a funding gap, assuming the appropriation has not run out. For example, IHS's appropriation for Indian health facilities remains available until expended, in contrast to its appropriation for Indian health services, which is generally available for a single fiscal year. In this regard, funds for Indian health services that IHS transfers to tribes and tribal organizations during the 1-year period of availability are deemed to be obligated at the time of the award and thereafter remain available to the tribes to operate their own health care programs without fiscal year limitation. Thus, to the extent sufficient funding remained available from federal or other sources during a lapse in appropriations, a tribe could continue to operate its own health care programs during a shutdown. IHS officials, tribal representatives, and other stakeholders GAO spoke with described how budget uncertainty resulting from CRs and government shutdowns can have a variety of effects on the provision of IHS-funded health care services for AI/ANs. For example, IHS officials said that, in general, most health care services would be expected to continue at IHS-operated facilities during a shutdown, as health care providers would be deemed \u201cexcepted\u201d personnel under the agency's contingency plan. However, officials noted some health care procedures could be delayed, as determined on a case-by-case basis at the local level. IHS officials also said that while lapses in appropriations do not halt patient care, they do create complications\u2014such as the determination of excepted personnel\u2014that could be eliminated by funding provided through advance appropriations. IHS officials and tribal representatives said existing challenges related to their recruitment and retention of health care providers\u2014many of which are related to the rural and remote locations of many of IHS's facilities\u2014are exacerbated by funding uncertainty resulting from CRs or potential government shutdowns. IHS officials and tribal representatives said that CRs create challenges for tribes in funding planned pay increases\u2014such as cost-of-living adjustments\u2014for health care staff at their facilities, and they may, as a result, defer increases. IHS officials and tribal representatives said that advance appropriations could mitigate these challenges. For example, IHS officials said that with advance appropriations, recruitment and outreach activities could continue without disruption, and selected candidates could be brought on board as scheduled. IHS officials and tribal representatives said that the agency and tribes incur additional administrative burden and costs when the government is funded through multiple CRs, due to the high proportion of IHS funding that is transferred to tribes through contracts and compacts. Specifically, IHS officials said there is an additional administrative burden generated by each CR that results in the distribution of funds to tribes. For example, IHS officials said there is an additional administrative burden generated by each CR that results in the distribution of funds to tribes. IHS officials said that the agency would have to do less administrative work overall, because currently, under a single year appropriation (with recurrent CRs), they may modify or amend agreements 7 or 8 times within a fiscal year. Although acknowledging that advance appropriation authority would entail the additional burden of preparing budget requests for more than one fiscal year, they expect",

DOD's cost comparison report addressed three elements and partially addressed one element concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations. GAO was asked to review DOD's cost comparison report. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's cost comparison report addressed the reporting elements and (2) the extent to which DOD addressed the reporting element to account for the full cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations. GAO reviewed DOD's Cost Comparison Report and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) Cost Comparison Report addressed three elements and partially addressed one element concerning the accounting for the fully-burdened, or full, cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel performing functions at the selected installations. DOD concluded that for the 21,000 federal civilians and service contractors compared, neither federal civilians nor service contractors were predominately more or less expensive, with the costs being dependent upon the function being performed, location, and level of expertise. DOD noted that the results were not generalizable across the department. GAO believes that DOD partially addressed the reporting element to account for the full cost of federal civilian and contractor personnel by providing an accounting of the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents for personnel performing similar functions at government-owned facilities during calendar year 2015, but excluding certain non-labor costs from its cost calculations.

    "gao_GAO-18-196": "Why GAO Did This Study The opioid epidemic has generated a significant increase in the number of substance-affected infants born and diagnosed with NAS. These vulnerable infants may be at risk for child abuse and neglect if adequate supports and services are not available to ensure their safety. CAPTA requires states to have policies and procedures to address the needs of these infants and their families, including mothers with a substance use disorder. GAO was asked to review the implementation of CAPTA. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have policies and procedures regarding the notification and investigation of substance-affected infants, and (2) the extent to which states have plans of safe care to address the needs of these infants and their families. GAO surveyed all 50 states and the District of Columbia, visited three states, and interviewed officials from ACF and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. GAO also interviewed officials from ACF and the three states. What GAO Found Most states reported that state policies and procedures require health care providers to notify the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Child Protective Service (CPS) about substance-affected infants. Some states reported that they explicitly require health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants. For example, Wisconsin reported that under its state law if tests indicate that infants have controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in their bodily fluids, the health care provider shall report the occurrence of that condition to CPS. Others reported that the requirement is met by their states' mandated reporter law\u2014whereby people in certain positions, including health care providers, are required to notify CPS about substance-affected infants, similar to the manner in which other mandatory reporters, like school teachers, day care personnel, and social workers are required to report other instances of child abuse and neglect. In response to GAO's survey, 42 states reported that state policies and procedures require health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants. Some states reported that they explicitly require health care providers to notify CPS of substance-affected infants. For example, Wisconsin reported that under its state law if tests indicate that infants have controlled substances or controlled substance analogs in their bodily fluids, the health care provider shall report the occurrence of that condition to CPS. Others reported that the requirement is met by their states' mandated reporter law\u2014whereby people in certain positions, including health care providers, are required to notify CPS about substance-affected infants, similar to the manner in which other mandatory reporters, like school teachers, day care personnel, and social workers are required to report other instances of child abuse and neglect. In addition, in written responses to GAO's survey, some states reported providing training and guidance to support the efforts of health care providers to notify CPS about these infants. Despite these policies, procedures, and guidance, in written responses to GAO's survey, a few states reported concerns about requiring health care providers to notify CPS about substance-affected infants and the definition of substance-affected. In response to GAO's survey, 46 states reported that they have policies and procedures for deciding which notifications about substance-affected infants are accepted for investigation. Seventeen of those states reported that all notifications of substance-affected infants are accepted for investigation, regardless of the circumstances. The remaining 29 states reported that they apply specific criteria to determine if children who present as substance-affected are accepted for investigation by CPS. Several states reported in written responses to GAO's survey that they base their criteria for accepting notifications on the infant's safety. For these states, drug exposure does not by itself indicate that an infant's safety is at risk.

    "gao_GAO-18-512T": "Why GAO Did This Study FEMA is responsible for coordinating and supporting the nation's preparedness efforts. FEMA's preparedness grant programs provide funding to states, localities, and other entities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from natural or manmade disasters, including terrorist incidents. FEMA's preparedness grant programs are administered by FEMA's component agency, FEMA. This statement discusses (1) FEMA's progress in addressing coordination, oversight, and assessments of preparedness grants; and (2) FEMA's progress in assessing its preparedness capabilities. This statement is based on GAO's February 2016 report, preparedness grant management: FEMA has taken some steps, but challenges remain in the effectiveness of FEMA's grant management. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed FEMA officials. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has taken some steps to address coordination, oversight, and assessments of preparedness grants, but challenges remain in the effectiveness of FEMA's grant management. For example, GAO found that FEMA headquarters staff in the General Planning and Development (GPD) and regional staff share management and monitoring responsibilities. However, GPD officials reported that in 2012 it changed course and decided to continue sharing grant management roles between headquarters and regions, referred to as a hybrid grant management structure. GPD officials said they changed course because, among other things, estimates that the costs of regionalization would be greater than the annual savings FEMA identified in an earlier study and concerns that inconsistent program implementation would occur across the regions, and outweighed the potential benefits. FEMA officials at that time said they had taken steps to address coordination challenges associated with this hybrid grant management structure. However, GAO found in February 2016 that these challenges continue. For example, states and FEMA regional officials told GAO that GPD staffs in headquarters and regions did not always coordinate their monitoring visits, which can be disruptive to the state emergency management agency's day-to-day operations. FEMA regional officials also reported that GPD staffs in headquarters and regions sometimes provided inconsistent guidance to grantees. Further, while GPD officials identified some steps they plan to take to address the challenges, GAO found that GPD lacked a plan with time frames and goals for addressing them. GAO recommended that FEMA develop a plan with time frames, goals, metrics, and milestones detailing how GPD intends to resolve longstanding challenges associated with its existing hybrid grants management model, which divides responsibilities between regional and headquarters staff. FEMA, however, did not concur with GAO's recommendation, stating that it disagreed with GAO's characterization of longstanding challenges in managing preparedness grants. FEMA has taken some steps to increase oversight across preparedness grant programs, but has not fully addressed the need for improved coordination among grant programs identified in GAO's prior work. Specifically, GAO found in February 2012 that multiple factors contribute to the risk of duplication among four FEMA preparedness grant programs\u2014the State Homeland Security Program, Urban Areas Security Initiative, Port Security Grant Program, and Transit Security Grant Program\u2014as these programs share similar goals, fund similar projects, and provide funds in the same geographic regions. Further, DHS's ability to track grant funding, specific funding recipients, and funding purposes varies among the programs, giving FEMA less visibility over some grant programs. Also, DHS's award process for some programs based allocation decisions on high-level, rather than specific, project information, which could further contribute to the risk of duplication. Although GAO's February 2012 analysis identified no cases of duplication among a sample of grant projects, the above factors collectively put FEMA at risk of funding duplicative projects. As a result, in 2012, GAO included these challenges in its annual report on duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives. FEMA has not yet taken action to fully address GAO's concerns. In the area of performance assessment, GAO reported in June 2013 that FEMA's two preparedness grant programs\u2014Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) and Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG)\u2014collect performance information through a variety of reporting mechanisms but face challenges in identifying verifiable program outcomes. These reporting mechanisms collect performance data used by FEMA regional offices and headquarters for different purposes. For example, headquarters focuses on the development of future program priorities and on reporting progress toward the National Preparedness Goal, while regions use program information to monitor primary grant recipients for compliance. DHS developed agency priority goals that reflect agency-wide, near-term priorities. According to FEMA officials, the EMPG and AFG programs have an indirect link to a DHS agency priority",

    "gao_GAO-18-378": "Why GAO Did This Study DHA is responsible for ensuring that MTFs provide safe and effective care to patients. DHA's reporting of adverse medical events is critical to preventing such events from occurring in the future. GAO was asked to review DHA's reporting of adverse medical events. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHA's policies for reporting adverse medical events align with DOD's policies and (2) the extent to which DHA's efforts to ensure it receives complete information about sentinel events and root cause analysis (RCA) reports are consistent and impeded by inconsistent reporting. GAO reviewed relevant DOD policies and DHA policies and reports, and interviewed DHA officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) policies for reporting adverse medical events are developed to implement DOD's policies\u2014which tend to be broad\u2014and may include additional requirements specific to their branch of military service. However, GAO found that aspects of these policies do not consistently align with DOD's policies, including the definitions for adverse medical events and sentinel events, as well as requirements for entering events into the Joint Patient Safety Report (JPSR) system. For example, the Navy uses DOD's definition of an adverse medical event\u2014which includes events that may or may not result in harm to the patient\u2014but the Army, Air Force, and the National Command (NCR) defined this term more narrowly, to include only an event that causes actual harm to the patient. While the difference in these definitions could potentially result in the underreporting of events, officials from all four of the MTFs GAO visited told GAO that the discrepancy does not have much of an impact because the individuals who report these events\u2014MTF personnel\u2014are unlikely to be aware of the difference and likely follow the broader DOD definition. The process used by the military services, NCR, and DHA to track sentinel events and RCA reports is fragmented. DHA officials told GAO they must rely on their reconciliation process to ensure that they have complete information. Specifically, on a monthly basis, DHA officials email separate spreadsheets of DHA's sentinel event records to each of the military services and NCR requesting confirmation of reported sentinel events and the status of overdue RCA reports, among other information. DHA officials acknowledged that their reconciliation process is inefficient and told GAO that their full-time employees and contractors spend an average of 80 hours per month working on it. Additionally, officials told GAO that sometimes information about sentinel events and RCA reports is lost or not effectively communicated due to complexities related to routing the email submissions and to turnover in the contract staff who track and reconcile this information. DHA officials told GAO that they sometimes do not receive a response to their emails, and in these cases, DHA assumes concurrence. Despite DHA's efforts to reconcile its information on sentinel events and RCA reports, GAO identified discrepancies and missing information in its tracking record. For example, DHA had a record of 19 sentinel events that the Navy did not have for 2013 through 2016. DHA officials were not sure of the reason for the discrepancy between their tracking record and the Navy's, but told GAO that sometimes sentinel events are reported to DHA and later determined to not be reportable, and DHA is not given the updated status of the event. DHA officials told GAO that they did not know the reasons for the discrepancies between the tracking records for the military services, NCR, and DHA or for the missing RCA reports. DHA's efforts to ensure it receives MOS reports are limited and impeded by inconsistent reporting tracking and unclear requirements about report submission. As of September 2017, DHA had received 27 MOS reports for the 319 sentinel events that were reported in 2016. However, DHA does not know how many reports it is missing because its efforts to reconcile information for these reports have been limited. Prior to January 2018, DHA did not include MOS reports as part of its reconciliation process for sentinel events and RCA reports. However, in January 2018, DHA officials told GAO they added MOS reports to their new monthly reconciliation process using the Comprehensive Analysis Progress Tracker. While this tracker displays the total number of MOS reports DHA has received, it does not display whether individual reported sentinel events have an associated MOS report. Without this information, DHA may be unable to identify which MOS reports are missing. DHA officials told GAO that they may revise the Comprehensive Analysis Progress Tracker to follow up on MOS reports associated with specific sentinel events in the future. DHA'",
    "gao_GAO-19-109": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Guard is responsible for providing security at the nation's airports, providing emergency relief during natural disasters, and providing emergency relief during local or statewide emergencies. In 2012, the National Guard established the Office of Complex Investigations (OCI) to conduct administrative investigations of sexual assault. GAO was asked to review OCI. This report examines (1) the extent to which OCI conducts administrative investigations of sexual assault and state assessments, (2) the extent to which OCI follows key policies and controls, and (3) the extent to which OCI adheres to key policies and controls. GAO reviewed relevant DOD guidance and OCI policies and controls, and interviewed DOD and OCI officials. GAO also analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 27 case files from 5 states from fiscal years 2016 and 2017\u2014out of a total of approximately 225 cases for those same years\u2014to determine whether OCI adheres to key policies and controls. What GAO Found The Office of Complex Investigations (OCI) conducts administrative investigations of reports of sexual assault, in addition to state assessments of state National Guard units. OCI is funded through appropriations made available for the Department of Defense's (DOD) Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program. OCI is staffed with temporarily assigned National Guard members as investigators. OCI is funded through appropriations made available for DOD's Sexual Assault Special Victims' Counsel Program. OCI is primarily staffed with National Guard members staffed temporarily to the office as investigators. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) guidance establishes policies for OCI's investigations, and OCI has implemented internal controls to help ensure it follows key policies. NGB guidance also establishes two criteria that allegations of sexual assault must meet for OCI to initiate an investigation; however, this guidance does not require OCI to consistently include documentation in its case files related to how its case acceptance criteria are met. For example, OCI may only conduct administrative investigations of sexual assault with an identified National Guard nexus. The NGB Manual includes a template that the states should use when submitting requests for OCI to initiate an investigation of an unrestricted report of sexual assault. However, GAO found that OCI's case files do not consistently include supporting documentation to show how the two case acceptance criteria\u2014specifically the determination of a National Guard nexus and verification of coordination with the appropriate criminal investigative organizations\u2014were met. This is because NGB policy does not require that OCI collect and include any additional documentation for verification purposes in its case files. Without a requirement that supporting documentation related to the National Guard nexus and criminal investigative organization coordination efforts is included in each case file, OCI does not have reasonable assurance that it is only undertaking investigations that meet case acceptance criteria. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, in coordination with the Office of Complex Investigations, includes a requirement in its guidance to collect and maintain supporting documentation as part of its case files that verifies whether and how (1) the National Guard nexus exists, and (2) the allegation has been referred to the appropriate military criminal investigative organization or civilian law enforcement organization prior to opening an OCI investigation. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-281": "Why GAO Did This Study VA's Choice Program allows eligible veterans to choose to obtain health care services from community providers rather than from VHA medical facilities. VAMCs are responsible for scheduling veterans' appointments with community providers and paying community providers for their services. GAO was asked to review veterans' access to care under the Choice Program. This report examines (1) the extent to which veterans' wait times for care under the Choice Program have been timely, (2) the extent to which VA's monitoring of veterans' access to care is reliable, and (3) factors that have affected veterans' access to care under the Choice Program. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 196 Choice Program authorizations; and interviewed VAMC officials, managers, and staff from six selected VAMCs. What GAO Found GAO's analysis of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) scheduling process indicates that veterans who are referred to the Choice Program for routine care because they are time-eligible could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days to obtain care, if VA medical centers (VAMC) and Veterans Providers Administrations (TPA) take the maximum amount of time allowed by VA's process. About 90 percent of Choice Program referrals in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 were scheduled under the time-eligibility process, which means that the majority of veterans referred to the program would have been subject to this potential wait time for an appointment for routine care. This 70-day potential wait time is in contrast to the Choice Act's required 30-day time frame for routine care. VA and VHA have not specified how many days VAMCs have to complete a key step of the process\u2014compiling relevant clinical information and sending veterans' referrals to the TPAs after veterans have agreed to be referred to the Choice Program. VA and VHA have not specified how many days VAMCs have to send veterans' Choice Program referrals to the TPAs. Without specifying wait-time goals that are achievable, and without designing appointment scheduling processes that are consistent with those goals, VA lacks assurance that veterans are receiving care from community providers in a timely manner. GAO's analysis indicates that VHA's ability to monitor Choice Program access is limited because the data VHA uses are not always accurate and reliable, and VHA lacks certain data that are needed to effectively monitor the program. For example, VHA's data do not capture the time VAMCs take to prepare veterans' Choice Program referrals and send them to the TPAs. In addition, VHA's monitoring of veterans' access to care is limited by a lack of complete, reliable data. For example, VHA's data do not capture the time VAMCs take to accept veterans' referrals and send them to the TPAs. Without complete, reliable data, VHA cannot determine whether the Choice Program has achieved the goals of alleviating the wait times veterans have experienced when seeking care at VHA medical facilities, and easing geographic burdens veterans may face to access care at VHA medical facilities. Multiple factors have adversely affected veterans' access to care under the Choice Program, providing potential lessons learned for VA's future community care program. Chief among these are (1) administrative burden associated with the Choice Program's complex referral and appointment scheduling processes; (2) inadequate VAMC staffing and poor communication between VAMCs; and (3) the TPAs' slow development of a robust provider network. GAO also identified actions VA and VHA have taken to address these factors. For example, VA and VHA took actions to improve the efficiency of the Choice Program's referral and appointment scheduling processes, but opportunities exist to improve or build on these actions as VA moves forward with the consolidated community care program it plans to implement. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA (1) specify wait-time goals that are achievable, (2) design appointment scheduling processes consistent with those goals, (3) develop a mechanism to monitor veterans' access to care, and (4) develop a mechanism to monitor veterans' access to care. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-95": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government invests billions of dollars annually in higher education through grants and loans to low-income students. Partially as a result of this investment, a college education is accessible to more low-income Americans than ever before. However, many low-income college students struggle to meet their basic needs, including obtaining the food that they need, and may drop out of college as a result. SNAP can be an important source of support for low-income students, although it may not completely ameliorate food insecurity. GAO was asked to review food insecurity among college students. This report examines (1) what is known about the extent of food insecurity among college students and their use of SNAP; (2) how selected colleges are addressing student food insecurity; and (3) the extent to which federal programs assist college students experiencing food insecurity. GAO reviewed 31 studies based on original research, analyzed federal data on low-income students, and interviewed federal officials and officials from 14 selected colleges. GAO also interviewed officials from federal agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture and Education, and officials from 14 state SNAP agencies. What GAO Found GAO reviewed 31 studies based on original research to determine what is known about food insecurity among college students. Estimates of food insecurity among college students included in the studies GAO reviewed ranged from 9 percent to well over 50 percent, with 22 of these of 31 studies estimating food insecurity rates of over 30 percent. These results reflect the studies' different samples and methods, and the estimates from the studies included in GAO's review are not generalizable to the college student population as a whole. None of the studies are based on a sufficiently large or diverse random sample of college students to constitute a representative study. The studies addressed the difficulty of sampling the college student population in different ways, including by extrapolating from household data, surveying students in a particular degree program or on a particular campus, or targeting particular, non-random sub-groups of the college student population. Most of the studies were also conducted on only one campus, although some studies gathered data from more than one campus. Despite the limitations, these studies as a whole help shed some light on the range of food insecurity that exists among some groups of college students. Federal data show most low-income students had multiple risk factors associated with food insecurity in 2016. For example, about 59 percent of all low-income students (3.3 million) in 2016 reported being enrolled at least half time and meeting a SNAP student eligibility exemption. About 1.8 million of these low-income students did not meet any of the student exemptions GAO could identify in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study data and reported that they did not receive SNAP benefits. About one-third of state SNAP agencies reported they were taking actions to inform college students about SNAP and help them access SNAP benefits. These state SNAP agencies reported assisting college students in various ways, including by developing guidance or training for state and college officials on student eligibility rules, by conducting outreach at local colleges, or by providing students with options to qualify for a SNAP student exemption by participating in employment and training services. Officials at 9 of the 14 colleges GAO contacted said they would like information from the Department of Education's (Education) Food Stamp (SNAP) program about student eligibility rules so they can help educate and enroll students in SNAP, but FNS has not developed such targeted information to distribute to colleges and students. Officials at one college said they requested information from FNS to distribute to students, but the general SNAP eligibility brochure FNS provided did not reference college student eligibility requirements. FNS officials said that the FNS national office was uniquely positioned to collect and share information about potential approaches that states are taking to implement the student exemption for employment and training programs so that other states could also consider using such approaches to assist low-income college students who may qualify. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FNS (1) make information on its website regarding student SNAP eligibility requirements easier to understand and more accessible, as a resource for colleges and state SNAP agencies; (2) coordinate with its regional offices to collect and review information about existing SNAP flexibilities and examples of approaches state SNAP agencies are taking to assist eligible college students to access SNAP benefits, and share such information with state SNAP agencies; and (3) coordinate with its regional offices to collect and review information about existing SNAP flexibilities and examples of approaches state SNAP agencies are taking to assist eligible college students to access SNAP benefits, and share such information with state SNAP agencies. FNS partially concurred with GAO's recommendations and plans to review",
    "gao_GAO-19-121": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) manages a majority of veterans' cemeteries in the United States. NCA's mission is to provide burial options to veterans and their families. NCA's plan entails establishing 18 new national cemeteries and awarding funds for new state veterans' cemeteries. GAO was asked to review NCA's plan to increase burial access for veterans. This report examines (1) NCA's progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access for veterans and (2) the extent to which NCA's cost estimates for cemetery construction projects are consistent with GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs. GAO reviewed NCA's plan and cost estimates, and interviewed VA officials. What GAO Found NCA has made some progress in implementing its plan to increase burial access for veterans, but that progress has been limited, as it is years behind its original schedule for opening new cemeteries. In 2014, NCA planned to open 18 new sites by the end of fiscal year 2017 to better serve the burial needs of the veteran population. However, completion of some of the urban and rural sites that are part of NCA's plan is currently estimated to take 5 years or longer than planned at significantly higher cost, in part because construction cost estimates for the remaining sites may be unreliable. Without NCA's revising its cost-estimating guidance to more fully reflect the 12 steps in the Cost Guide, including \u201cconducting a risk and uncertainty analysis,\u201d NCA will not be well-positioned to provide reliable cost estimates to VA and enable it to make informed decisions regarding the funding and oversight of NCA's ongoing minor construction projects to enhance veterans' burial options.

    "gao_GAO-18-459": "Why GAO Did This Study The Animal Welfare Act requires federal agencies that use or intend to use live animals in research to report on their use of these animals. The act also requires federal research facilities to report on their use of animals in research. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' use of animals in research. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal agencies report their use of animals covered by the act and (2) the extent to which federal agencies share information about their use of animals. GAO analyzed federal agency data on their use of animals covered by the act and surveyed federal agencies and stakeholders about their views on whether federal agencies should proactively and routinely share information about their use of animals. GAO also interviewed officials from APHIS and NIH. What GAO Found The Animal Welfare Act requires federal agencies that use or intend to use live animals in research to report on their use of these animals. As directed by the regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act, the 10 agencies GAO reviewed submitted to APHIS the required annual reports on their use of animals covered by the act from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. However, APHIS's reporting instructions have not ensured consistent and complete reporting because they have been unclear about which animal species, activities, and activity locations are required to be reported for the purposes of the Animal Welfare Act. Federal research facilities that conduct activities with animals using Public Health Service funding that GAO reviewed met NIH requirements to provide assurance documentation about their animal use programs and to provide required annual reports for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. However, APHIS's 2017 instructions for completing the annual report do not sufficiently clarify the conditions under which a field study would qualify, nor do they point to any source providing clarifying language. APHIS plans to develop clarifying guidance on field studies and will publish the guidance for public comment. By defining the birds that need to be reported, by instructing federal research facilities to report research activities outside the United States, and by working with the research community to develop clear criteria for identifying field studies, APHIS would have greater assurance that the data it receives from research facilities fully reflect the activities covered by the Animal Welfare Act. APHIS and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) publicly report some information about federal agencies' use of research animals. However, APHIS does not explain on its website potential limitations related to the accuracy and completeness of the annual reports that it provides to the public or in the national summaries of the annual reports that APHIS prepares. For example, APHIS does not explain that research facilities' annual reports may contain data on animals used for activities that are not covered by the Animal Welfare Act regulations, such as excluded field studies. Additionally, APHIS does not explain that the annual reports do not include birds not bred for research\u2014and consequently covered by the Animal Welfare Act\u2014because APHIS has instructed facilities to not report any birds. Furthermore, APHIS does not explain that it does not validate the accuracy and completeness of agencies' reporting. In particular, APHIS officials told GAO that they have the opportunity to validate reporting when they inspect nonfederal facilities, but do not have the authority to inspect federal research facilities unless invited to do so. Some stakeholders responded to GAO's survey that they use the data that APHIS reports on animal use to identify trends and practices within the research community. By fully implementing USDA guidance by explaining what the data represent and possible issues with their quality, APHIS could have more assurance that it is providing these data to users in a manner that is as accurate, clear, complete and unbiased as possible. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that APHIS develop a timeline for defining birds that are not bred for research and that are covered by the Animal Welfare Act, and that research facilities report to APHIS their use of birds covered by the act. APHIS disagreed with one recommendation, stating that it will submit a recommendation and timeline by September 30, 2018. GAO continues to believe that APHIS should develop such a timeline.",
    "gao_GAO-19-197": "Why GAO Did This Study The 21st Century Cures Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national framework for exchanging health information electronically. ONC is responsible for coordinating efforts to improve patient record matching. GAO was asked to review patient record matching. This report examines (1) how patient record matching approaches and associated challenges are used, and (2) the extent to which ONC and others have undertaken efforts to improve patient record matching. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from ONC, selected provider representatives, and other stakeholders. GAO also interviewed stakeholders from five HIE organizations, selected based on geographic dispersion and other factors. GAO also interviewed stakeholders from a non-generalizable sample of seven HIE organizations. What GAO Found Stakeholders GAO interviewed described patient record matching approaches and associated challenges. Providers and health information technology (IT) organizations described using both manual and automated approaches to match patients' records when exchanging health information with other providers. Automated matching can also involve some degree of manual review, as algorithms can identify potential matches by providing information about the likelihood that two records with similar information refer to the same individual. Provider representatives identified several reasons that patients' demographic information can be incomplete or contain different data elements across the medical records maintained by multiple providers. For example, providers collect different information from their patients, and health IT systems can collect demographic data differently. Provider representatives said that inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistently formatted demographic information in patients' medical records can make it challenging to identify and match all the records belonging to a single patient. Stakeholders identified a variety of efforts they have undertaken or are currently undertaking to improve the ability to match patients' medical records accurately. These efforts include implementing common standards for demographic data; developing a data set to test the accuracy of matching methods; sharing best practices and other resources; implementing a national unique patient identifier; and developing a public-private collaboration effort to improve patient record matching. Stakeholders identified several efforts that could improve matching, and had varying views on the roles ONC and others should play in these efforts. Among the examples of efforts stakeholders identified that could improve matching were implementing common standards for demographic data; developing a data set to test the accuracy of matching methods; sharing best practices and other resources; implementing a national unique patient identifier; and developing a public-private collaboration effort to improve patient record matching. Multiple stakeholders noted that no single effort would be sufficient to improve matching, given the factors that contribute to matching challenges.

SBA uses two government-wide data systems to measure agencies' small business contracting activity. GAO was asked to review SBA's scorecard program. This report describes (1) revisions to the scorecard methodology for fiscal year 2017 and results of the fiscal year 2017 scorecard, as well as the extent to which SBA plans to evaluate the effects of revisions; (2) the extent to which SBA's revised scorecard methodology uses relevant and reliable information and SBA publishes accurate scorecards; and (3) views of selected federal agencies and industry stakeholders on the extent to which SBA's revised scorecard methodology may encourage agencies to expand small business procurement opportunities. GAO reviewed SBA's scorecard methodology and related documents, and interviewed SBA and other agency officials and representatives from small business groups. What GAO Found The Small Business Administration (SBA) revised the Small Business Procurement Scorecard methodology prior to fiscal year 2017 to make it consistent with changes required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA). Specifically, SBA reduced the proportion of the total scorecard results related to prime contracting performance from 80 percent to 50 percent and added an element to calculate changes in the number of small business prime contractors compared to the prior year. SBA officials said they considered, but did not add, a scorecard element that calculated changes in the number of small business subcontractors, which the 2016 NDAA required to be included if data were available. SBA also made other changes to the scorecard methodology, as the agency was permitted to do under the 2016 NDAA. SBA adjusted the weights of other scorecard elements, increasing subcontracting performance from 10 percent to 20 percent of the total scorecard result and increasing the peer review evaluation element from 10 percent to 20 percent. SBA also established that the new statutorily required element to assess changes in the number of prime contractors would be weighted at 10 percent. SBA officials said they considered, but did not add, a scorecard element that calculated changes in the number of small business subcontractors, which the 2016 NDAA required to be included if data were available. SBA officials said they determined that data were not available to implement this change. SBA also made other changes to the scorecard methodology, as the agency was permitted to do under the 2016 NDAA. SBA officials said they adjusted the weights of other scorecard elements, increasing subcontracting performance from 10 percent to 20 percent of the total scorecard result and increasing the peer review evaluation element from 10 percent to 20 percent. SBA officials said they also revised the peer review evaluation element in an effort to facilitate a more in-depth review of agencies' compliance with section 15(k) requirements. SBA officials said they were preparing a plan for evaluating the effects of scorecard revisions, but had not completed a plan to evaluate the effects of the scorecard revisions. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives, such as those in an agency's strategic plan. A comprehensive evaluation of revisions to the scorecard that includes key attributes for effective program evaluations could aid SBA officials in determining whether the revised scorecard provides better information and whether the scorecard revisions are designed and implemented appropriately. Such an evaluation also could assist SBA in understanding whether the scorecard revisions may contribute to maximizing contract dollars awarded to small businesses, which is one of the goals in SBA's strategic plan. SBA uses two government-wide data systems to measure agencies' small business contracting activity\u2014the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation and the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System\u2014to calculate scorecard results, but the process for producing scorecards has weaknesses. Federal law prohibits SBA from requiring agencies to use alternative data collection methods for the purposes of the scorecard calculations. SBA officials said eSRS has limitations that make it challenging to verify the accuracy of reported subcontracting activity, and GAO has previously identified eSRS limitations in its prior work. SBA officials said they performed accurate calculations for determining agencies' performance and that inaccuracies in the published scorecards were the result of transcription errors associated with formatting the results for publication. SBA officials said they used new software to publish the fiscal year 2017 scorecards so that they could be accessible to visually impaired readers. Making the scorecards more accessible required some additional steps and at times required manual data entry due to",
    "gao_GAO-18-274T": "Why GAO Did This Study VA's MSPV-NG program is a new iteration of the legacy MSPV program that was designed to standardize medical supplies used at VA medical centers. The MSPV-NG program is intended to improve the efficiency of the supply chain and reduce costs. GAO was asked to testify on the MSPV-NG program. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which VA's implementation of MSPV-NG has been executed in line with leading practices, and (2) the extent to which the MSPV-NG program has met the needs of medical centers. This statement is based on GAO's November 2017 report, which examined the MSPV-NG program and the MSPV-NG requirements development process. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed VA and hospital officials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implemented the MSPV-NG program\u2014from its initial work to identify a list of supply requirements in early 2015, through its roll-out of the formulary to medical centers in December 2016\u2014was not executed in line with leading practices. Specifically, VA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition that, if in place, could have facilitated buy-in for the change throughout the organization. Further, the initial requirements development process and tight time frames contributed to ineffective contracting processes. As a result, VHA developed an initial formulary that did not meet the needs of the medical centers and has yet to achieve utilization and cost avoidance goals. VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the initial roll out. Key among these was to increase the level of clinical involvement, that is, to obtain input from the doctors and nurses at VA's individual medical facilities. Despite changes aimed at improving implementation, the agency continues to face challenges that prevent the program from fully achieving its goals. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to VA to improve implementation of the MSPV-NG program. VA agreed with these recommendations and reported it would have a strategy in place by December 2017.",

These components address potential chemical attacks as part of an all-hazards approach to address a wide range of threats and hazards. DHS's chemical defense programs and activities have been fragmented and not well coordinated, but DHS recently created the CWMD Office to, among other things, promote better integration and coordination among these programs and activities.

    "gao_GAO-18-181": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD requires reservists to maintain readiness by participating regularly in training to maintain the military skills needed to perform their mission. DOD's six reserve components reported paying or reimbursing over $925 million in travel costs for reservists in fiscal year 2015, representing about 4.3 percent of the total obligations identified in the Reserve Personnel accounts. With an actual part-time endstrength of 742,683 reservists in fiscal year 2015, DOD spent an average cost of about $1,246 per reservist. GAO was asked to review DOD's travel policies. This report examines (1) the extent to which reservists incur out-of-pocket travel expenses to perform their service, and (2) the extent to which DOD has assessed the potential effect of unreimbursed out-of-pocket travel expenses on the retention of reservists. GAO reviewed DOD's travel policies and interviewed DOD officials. GAO also reviewed DOD's Joint Travel Regulations and DOD's Joint Travel Regulations. What GAO Found Reservists may incur expenses under certain conditions in connection with their service that are not reimbursable under Department of Defense (DOD) travel regulations. Officials responsible for travel regulations and reserve policy issues told GAO that this can occur because (1) the cost to attend Inactive Duty Training is a reservist's responsibility, except in limited circumstances; and (2) DOD designates longer duration training or assignments as a Permanent Change of Station\u2014a change in a reservist's home of record\u2014and not as temporary travel. DOD's Joint Travel Regulations require all military personnel at a given training or assignment to be in the same status. However, officials told GAO that due to the interim nature of such assignments reservists are unlikely to move their families, and reservists may incur unreimbursed expenses due to the cost of maintaining two homes. DOD has not fully assessed the potential effect of unreimbursed out-of-pocket travel expenses on the retention of reservists. DOD reports have noted that such unreimbursed travel expenses, among other factors, may be a challenge for reservists and may therefore affect retention. For example, in 2008, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves reported that travel requirements and associated costs had a negative effect on DOD's ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, particularly for leadership positions. In addition, in minutes of its meetings, the Air Reserve Forces Policy Committee has called for changes to the Permanent Change of Station requirement for long-duration training, noting in 2015 that it, \u201cfrequently creates financial hardship for RC Airmen who typically maintain a residence near their assigned unit or civilian employer.\u201d While DOD has not yet assessed the potential effect of unreimbursed travel expenses on retention of reservists in a comprehensive manner and the related overall cost to the federal government, DOD has not yet systematically collected data and assessed the potential effect of current travel reimbursement policy on retention across all services, as measured by outcomes such as fill rates for critical positions and other metrics, or collected more basic information such as the number of reservists who do not move their home during long-duration training, the distances traveled for Inactive Duty Training, and the amount of unreimbursed expenses incurred by reservists. Federal internal control standards state that management requires quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate an entity's performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risk. However, without collecting more comprehensive information on the potential effect of the current travel policy on the retention of reservists, DOD would be considering alternative proposals with only the limited data and analysis available to date. Further, the lack of comprehensive data and analysis on the influence of current travel policies will limit DOD's ability to reach an analytically based decision which weighs the costs and benefits of any potential changes. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD collect quality information and conduct an analysis of the potential effects of unreimbursed travel expenses incurred by reservists to perform military service on DOD's ability to retain reservists in the force, and respond to these risks by considering the costs and benefits of any possible actions to address the identified issues. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-179": "Why GAO Did This Study The retirement savings of millions of Americans are a significant source of retirement income. However, the amount of retirement savings in retirement accounts continues to grow. Early access to retirement savings in these plans may incentivize plan participation, increase participant contributions, and provide participants with a way to address their financial needs. However, billions of dollars continue to leave the retirement system early. GAO was asked to review early withdrawals of retirement savings. This report examines (1) what are the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from retirement savings; (2) what is known about the factors that might lead individuals to access their retirement savings early; and (3) what strategies or policies, if any, might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings. GAO analyzed data from 2013 and 2013 on early withdrawals from 401(k) plans and IRAs, and interviewed a wide range of stakeholders, including retirement research experts, financial technology companies, participant advocacy organizations, and industry associations. What GAO Found In 2013, individuals ages 25 to 55 withdrew at least $68.7 billion early from their retirement accounts. Of this amount, IRA owners in this age group withdrew the largest share (about 57 percent) and 401(k) plan participants in this age group withdrew the rest (about 43 percent) However, a total amount withdrawn from 401(k) plans cannot be determined due to data limitations. In 2013, at least $29.2 billion left 401(k) plans in the form of hardship withdrawals, cashouts at job separation, and unrepaid plan loans. Loan defaults accounted for at least $800 million withdrawn from 401(k) plans in 2013; however, the amount of distributions of unpaid plan loans is likely larger as data cannot be used to quantify plan loan offsets that are deducted from participants' account balances after they leave a plan. Without better data of the amount of unpaid plan loans, the amount of loan offsets and the characteristics of plan participants who did not repay their plan loans at job separation cannot be determined. Additional Tax Consequences of Early Withdrawals IRA owners and plan participants paid $6.2 billion as a result of the additional 10 percent tax for early distributions in 2013. Although the taxes are generally treated separately from the amounts withdrawn, IRA owners and plan participants are expected to pay any applicable taxes resulting from the additional 10 percent tax when filing their income taxes for the tax year in which the withdrawal occurred. Stakeholders GAO interviewed said that plan rules related to the disposition of account balances at job separation can lead participants to remove more than they need, up to and including their entire balance. Stakeholders said that plan rules can lead participants to remove more than they need, up to and including their entire balance. Stakeholders said that plan rules can lead to reduced savings for some participants. For example, some plan sponsors said they allow participants to take loans to purchase a home. Stakeholders said that certain plan loan policies could lead to early withdrawals of retirement savings. For example, some plan sponsors said they provided participants with an option to receive periodic installment distributions at intervals determined by the participants. Some plan sponsors said they provided participants with an option to receive periodic installment distributions at intervals determined by the participants. Some plan sponsors said they placed certain limits on participant loan activity, which may reduce the incidence of loan defaults.

    "gao_GAO-18-313": "Why GAO Did This Study Remittances from the United States are an important source of funds for GAO's case-study countries\u2014Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and Somalia. The BSA requires money transmitters to establish and maintain anti-money laundering programs, and BSA/AML compliance programs are designed to ensure that money transmitters comply with BSA/AML requirements. GAO was asked to review challenges money transmitters face in remitting funds from the United States to fragile countries. This report examines (1) what stakeholders believe are the challenges facing money transmitters in remitting funds from the United States to selected fragile countries, (2) what actions U.S. agencies have taken to address identified challenges, and (3) U.S. efforts to assess the effects of such challenges on remittance flows from the United States to fragile countries. GAO surveyed a nationally representative sample of banks, interviewed U.S. agency officials, and interviewed 12 money transmitters serving four case-study countries: Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and Somalia. GAO also interviewed U.S.-based remittance senders who send money to GAO case-study countries. What GAO Found Money transmitters serving Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and especially Somalia reported losing bank accounts or having restrictions placed on them, which some banks confirmed. As a result, some money transmitters have relied on non-banking channels, such as cash couriers, to transfer remittances. All 12 money transmitters GAO interviewed reported losing some banking relationships in the last 10 years. Some money transmitters, including all 4 that served Somalia, said they relied on non-banking channels, such as moving cash, to transfer funds, which increased their operational costs and exposure to risks. Further, in GAO's interviews some banks reported that they had closed the accounts of money transmitters because of the high cost of due diligence actions they considered necessary to minimize the risk of fines under Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) regulations. Treasury officials noted that despite information that some money transmitters have lost banking accounts, Treasury sees no evidence that the volume of remittances is falling or that costs of sending remittances are rising. In addition, U.S.-based remittance senders who send money to GAO case-study countries reported no significant difficulties in using money transmitters to remit funds. Treasury officials reported that remittances continue to flow to fragile countries even though money transmitters face challenges, including some evidence of money transmitter bank account closures. Treasury officials noted that despite information that some money transmitters have lost banking accounts, Treasury sees no evidence that the volume of remittances is falling or that costs of sending remittances are rising. In addition, U.S.-based remittance senders who send money to GAO case-study countries reported no significant difficulties in using money transmitters to remit funds. U.S. agencies have taken certain steps to address challenges money transmitters face in transferring funds through banks from the United States to fragile countries. Treasury, among other things, has issued guidance to clarify expectations for providing banking services to money transmitters. In addition, Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance is engaged in long-term capacity building efforts in Haiti, Liberia, and Somalia to improve those countries' weak financial institutions and regulatory mechanisms, factors that may cause banks to consider money transmitters remitting to these countries to be more risky clients. However, agency officials disagreed with some suggestions for government action proposed by banks and others because such actions would contravene agencies' BSA/AML compliance goals. Treasury cannot assess the effects of money transmitters' loss of banking access on remittance flows because existing data do not allow Treasury to identify remittances transferred through banking and non-banking channels. Recent efforts to collect international remittance data from banks and credit unions do not include transfers these institutions make on behalf of money transmitters. Since these data collection efforts are designed to protect U.S. consumers, the remittance data that banks and credit unions report are limited to remittances individual consumers send directly through these institutions. Additionally, a few state regulators recently began requiring money transmitters to report remittance data by destination country, but these data do not distinguish money transmitters' use of banking and non-banking channels to transfer funds. Finally, while Treasury has a long-standing effort to collect information on travelers transporting cash from U.S. ports of exit, this information",
    "gao_GAO-18-608": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. government has a long-standing interest in ensuring that foreign nationals seeking temporary admission into the United States are screened and vetted for immigration and other benefits. In fiscal year 2017, the Department of State (State) issued about 2.8 million nonimmigrant visas (NIV), which are issued to foreign nationals such as tourists, business visitors, and students seeking temporary admission into the United States. GAO was asked to review the visa adjudication process. This report examines (1) the number of NIV adjudications and the number of NIVs issued annually, (2) the number of NIVs refused, and (3) the changes to NIV screening and vetting processes in calendar year 2017. GAO analyzed State data on NIVs issued from fiscal years 2012 through 2017; reviewed relevant laws and executive orders; and interviewed State, DHS, and other agency officials. What GAO Found The total number of nonimmigrant visas (NIV) that consular officers adjudicated annually (or, NIV adjudications) peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, which was an increase of approximately 30 percent since fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2017, NIV adjudications decreased by about 880,000 adjudications, or about 7 percent. State data indicate that the number of NIVs adjudicated by visa group, applicant's country of nationality, and location of adjudication were generally consistent, with some exceptions. The percentage of NIVs refused\u2014known as the refusal rate\u2014increased from about 14 percent in fiscal year 2012 to about 22 percent in fiscal year 2016, and remained about the same in fiscal year 2017; averaging about 18 percent over the time period. The majority of NIVs refused in fiscal year 2017 were based on the consular officers' determination that the applicants were ineligible nonimmigrants\u2014in other words, the consular officers believed that the applicant was an intending immigrant seeking to stay permanently in the United States, which would generally violate NIV conditions. Approximately 0.05 percent of NIVs were refused for terrorism and other security-related reasons from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Executive actions taken in calendar year 2017 introduced new visa entry restrictions and requirements to enhance screening and vetting, including for NIVs. In calendar year 2017, the President issued two executive orders and a presidential proclamation that required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain countries of concern, a review of information needed for visa adjudication, and changes to visa (including NIV) screening and vetting protocols and procedures. Among other things, the President issued Executive Order 13780, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, which instituted visa and refugee entry restrictions, and an accompanying memorandum addressed to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security and the Attorney General, calling for heightened screening and vetting of visa applications and other immigration benefits. EO-2's entry restrictions have expired, but the visa entry restrictions outlined in the Proclamation continue to be fully implemented as of June 2018, consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's June 26, 2018, decision, which held that the President may lawfully establish nationality-based entry restrictions under the INA, and that Proclamation 9645 itself \u201cis squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.\u201d GAO's analysis of State data indicates that out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented in accordance with the executive actions. More than 90 percent of the NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017 pursuant to an executive action were for tourist and business visitor visas, and more than 5 percent were for students and exchange visitors. State data also indicate that the number of applications adjudicated for nationals of the 7 countries identified in EO-1\u2014Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen\u2014decreased by 22 percent in fiscal year 2017, as compared to a 7 percent general decrease in NIV adjudications worldwide that year. DHS, State, and other agencies are implementing changes to NIV screening and vetting processes consistent with the executive actions and associated guidance. For example, DHS officials stated that they are exploring the extent to which current screening and vetting technologies can be expanded. DHS officials stated that they are implementing the uniform standards for screening and vetting for immigration programs. DHS officials stated that the department is implementing the uniform standards for all applicants seeking an immigration benefit, including NIV applicants.

    "gao_GAO-18-656": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government supports research in areas such as quantum computing and synthetic biology. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to support these advances. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal agencies and nonfederal entities support research in these areas and (2) the extent to which agencies coordinate research in these areas. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed federal officials, stakeholders, and experts; and convened a meeting with experts from the National Academies. What GAO Found Multiple federal agencies and nonfederal entities support quantum computing and synthetic biology research that could lead to transformational technological advances in many areas of the U.S. economy, including energy, medicine, and national security. GAO identified 6 agencies that in fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 supported quantum computing research to advance foundational understanding of quantum computing or to develop related hardware and software. Similarly, GAO identified 10 agencies that, during the timeframe GAO reviewed, supported synthetic biology research to advance foundational understanding of synthetic biology or knowledge of how to apply it in bioengineering, national security, and biofuels development. GAO also identified a variety of nonfederal entities, such as universities and private companies, that conduct research in quantum computing and synthetic biology. Agencies coordinate research through a range of efforts, but GAO found that certain efforts are new and that agencies have not fully implemented selected leading practices for collaboration in these efforts. Agency officials said they coordinate on quantum computing and synthetic biology research through a range of efforts, but GAO found that certain efforts are new and that agencies have not fully implemented selected leading practices for collaboration in these efforts. Agency officials said they coordinate on quantum computing and synthetic biology research through a range of efforts, but GAO found that certain efforts are new and that agencies have not fully implemented selected leading practices for collaboration in these efforts. For example, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) established a new working group on quantum computing research in June 2018. However, the working group has not fully implemented leading practices for collaboration, such as defining and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. As the working group moves forward, by taking steps to fully implement these leading practices, member agencies could better marshal their collective efforts to support research in the areas of quantum computing and synthetic biology and help maintain U.S. competitiveness through transformational technological advances. Experts who participated in the meeting GAO convened with the assistance of the National Academies identified four key considerations for maintaining U.S. competitiveness through transformational technological advances.

    "gao_GAO-18-502": "Why GAO Did This Study In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies to provide students with disabilities with pre-employment transition services. WIOA also requires Education to provide states with technical assistance and to update interagency agreements with state educational agencies. GAO was asked to review the implementation of pre-employment transition services. This report examines (1) the steps states have reported taking to implement pre-employment transition services, and (2) the implementation challenges, if any, states reported facing, and how Education has addressed them. GAO surveyed all 79 state VR agencies from October through December 2017; analyzed federal laws and regulations, and Education's guidance and technical assistance documents; and interviewed officials from Education, state VR agencies, and state educational agencies. What GAO Found Most state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey reported expanding services for students with disabilities since the enactment of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) in July 2014 by either serving more students through pre-employment transition services or by initiating new or additional services. Most state VR agencies reported providing each of the required activities to students with disabilities before the enactment of WIOA, while fewer reported initiating these services since enactment. Most state VR agencies reported building their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services by, among other things, establishing a new specialist position and expanding contracts with service providers. Most state VR agencies reported taking a range of actions to build their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services, including building staff capacity and expanding contracts with service providers. Twenty-one of 56 states (50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia) reported using the full amount of grant funds they reserved for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities for fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent full year of data available from Education. In aggregate, states reportedly expended approximately $357 million out of the approximately $465 million reserved (about $108 million less than the target) for fiscal year 2016. For fiscal year 2015, states reportedly expended approximately $324 million on pre-employment transition services out of the approximately $453 million reserved for that purpose (about $130 million less than the target). Education provided states with broad requirements but provided little detailed information directly to states on the allowable use of funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. Education officials said they plan to issue additional guidance as needed. However, without clear timeframes for the issuance of this guidance, states do not know when information will become available to help them make decisions on allowable expenditures for pre-employment transition services. As a result, opportunities may be missed to identify and serve all students who might be eligible, and unserved students could continue to face difficulties preparing for a future of meaningful postsecondary education or employment. In addition, agreements between state VR and educational agencies can help facilitate the effective coordination of and financial responsibility for services. Finally, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices for implementing pre-employment transition services. Developing a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices would help Education provide states with information on best practices, such as balancing service delivery between pre-employment transition services and other VR services and collecting data that other states may have successfully addressed. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing states with additional information on allowable expenditures for pre-employment transition services, (2) take additional steps to provide states assistance on updating and finalizing their interagency agreements with state educational agencies to include pre-employment transition services, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices.

GAO also visited four regional offices selected based on the number of claims filed by veterans and the number of claims processed. What GAO Found The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) manages workload and performance through established processes, but guidance for processing claims with errors has gaps. VBA allocates claims workload across offices based on their capacity, but guidance for processing claims with errors has gaps. VBA's National Work Queue distributes claims based on VBA priorities, such as veterans with documented hardships. VBA provides some guidance to Rating Veterans Service Representatives regarding the circumstances in which they should defer claims, but does not have corresponding guidance for Veterans Service Representatives. VBA has developed processes and tools for communicating performance information to regional offices and for identifying common errors. For example, VBA sets timeliness goals for regional offices and generates daily claims processing timeliness data for each office. However, VBA's two primary performance measures for regional offices do not allow the agency to adequately measure claims timeliness and accuracy. Specifically, VBA's two primary performance measures for regional offices do not allow the agency to adequately measure claims timeliness and accuracy. Finally, communication with VSOs and congressional caseworkers could be improved by clarifying the VSO communication policy and aligning it with practice and VSO needs, and conducting caseworker outreach in order to provide more consistent and timely information to VSOs and caseworkers. Without these improvements, VSOs and caseworkers may not be able to serve veterans in as timely a manner as possible. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VBA clarify guidance to regional offices for handling claims when errors are identified, develop and implement a new performance measure for regional office timeliness and accuracy, and evaluate its policy for regional office communication with VSOs. VA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-596T": "Why GAO Did This Study In recent contingency operations, burn pits\u2014shallow excavations or surface features with berms used to conduct open-air burning\u2014were often chosen as a method of waste disposal. However, in 2016, GAO reported that the use of burn pits in the CENTCOM area of responsibility had declined since that time. GAO was asked to provide information on the health risks of burn pits. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which DOD has assessed the health risks of burn pits and (2) the extent to which DOD has assessed the health risks of burn pits. This statement is based on GAO's September 2016 report, which examined DOD's assessment of the health risks of burn pits and the extent to which DOD has assessed the health risks of burn pits. GAO reviewed relevant DOD guidance and interviewed DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs officials. What GAO Found In its September 2016 report, GAO found that the effects from exposing individuals to burn pit emissions were not well understood, and DOD had not fully assessed these health risks. Under DOD Instruction 6055.01, DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program, it is DOD policy to apply risk-management strategies to eliminate occupational injury or illness and loss of mission capability or resources. DOD Instruction 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), requires that hazards be identified and risk evaluated as early as possible, including the consideration of exposure patterns, duration, and rates. Notwithstanding this guidance, which applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD had not fully assessed the health risks of use of burn pits according to DOD officials. According to DOD officials, DOD's ability to assess these risks was limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as required by its own guidance. DOD Instruction 4715.19 requires that plans for the use of open-air burn pits include ensuring the area was monitored by qualified force health protection personnel for unacceptable exposures, and CENTCOM Regulation 200-2, CENTCOM Contingency Environmental Standards, requires steps to be taken to sample or monitor burn pit emissions. However, DOD officials stated that there were no processes in place to specifically monitor burn pit emissions for the purposes of correlating potential exposures. They attributed this to a lack of singular exposure to the burn pit emissions, or emissions from any other individual item; instead, monitoring was done for the totality of air pollutants from all sources at the point of population exposure. As GAO reported in September 2016, given the potential use of burn pits near installations and their potential use in future contingency operations, establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to collect data that could help assess exposure to risks. In the absence of the collection of data to examine the effects of burn pit exposure on servicemembers, the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2014 created the airborne hazards and open-air burn pit registry, which allows eligible individuals to self-report exposures to airborne hazards (such as smoke from burn pits, oil-well fires, or pollution during deployment), as well as other exposures and health concerns. The registry helps to monitor health conditions affecting veterans and servicemembers, and to collect data that would assist in improving programs to help those with deployment exposure concerns. In response to a mandate contained in section 201 of Public Law 112-260, the Department of Veterans Affairs entered into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to convene a committee to provide recommendations on collecting, maintaining, and monitoring information through the registry. The committee assessed the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans Affairs' information gathering efforts and provided recommendations for addressing the future medical needs of the affected groups. The committee released its final report in February 2017. As GAO reported in September 2016, considering the results of this review as well as the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine study as part of an examination of the relationship between direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions and long-term health effects could better position DOD to fully assess those health risks. In a May 2018 status update regarding this recommendation, DOD stated that it will be updating applicable department policy and procedures, its tactics techniques and procedures manual, and guidance for sampling and analysis plans to improve monitoring of burn pit emissions and other airborne hazard emissions. Specifically, DOD stated it will update DOD Instruction 6490.03, Deployment Health; that the update will provide revised procedures on deployment health activities required before, during, and after deployments, including Occupational",
    "gao_GAO-18-694T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees the quality of nursing homes that receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. CMS collects data on nursing home quality through annual standard surveys and complaint investigations, as well as other sources, such as staffing data and clinical quality measures. In October 2015, GAO reported on the extent to which CMS's oversight of nursing home quality has improved. This statement discusses (1) the results of GAO's October 2015 report on nursing home quality and (2) CMS's efforts to oversee nursing home quality. This statement is based on GAO's October 2015 report, which examined data on nursing home quality trends and CMS's oversight of nursing home quality. GAO reviewed CMS data on nursing home quality trends from 2005 to 2014, reviewed CMS documents, and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found In its October 2015 report examining trend data that give insight into nursing home quality, GAO found that four key data sets showed mixed results, and data issues complicated the ability to assess quality trends. Nationally, one of the four data sets\u2014consumer complaints\u2014suggested consumers' concerns over nursing home quality increased from 2005 to 2014. However, the other three data sets\u2014deficiencies, staffing levels, and clinical quality measures\u2014indicated potential improvement in nursing home quality. Specifically, GAO found consumer complaints\u2014which can originate from residents, families, ombudsmen, or others acting on a resident's behalf\u2014had a 21 percent increase from 2005 to 2014. In contrast, nurse staffing levels increased 9 percent from 2009 to 2014 and selected quality measure scores showed decreases in the number of reported quality problems, such as falls resulting in major injury from 2011 to 2014. In addition, GAO identified 416 homes in 36 states that had consistently poor performance across the four data sets. Data issues complicated CMS's ability to assess quality trends. For example, the use of multiple survey types, such as both traditional paper-based surveys and electronic surveys, to conduct the standard survey that every nursing home receiving Medicare or Medicaid payment must undergo complicates the ability to compare the results of these surveys nationally. In its October 2015 report, GAO recommended that CMS implement the same survey methodology across all states; HHS agreed with this recommendation and in November 2017 completed its national implementation of this electronic survey methodology. In addition, GAO found that CMS's ability to use available data to assess nursing home quality trends was complicated by various issues with these data, which made it difficult to determine whether observed trends reflect actual changes in quality, data issues, or both. CMS has taken some actions to address these data complications, however, more work is needed. GAO found that CMS had made numerous modifications to its nursing home oversight activities in recent years, but had not monitored the potential effect of these modifications on nursing home quality oversight. Some of these modifications expanded or added new oversight activities\u2014for example, CMS expanded the number of tools available to state surveyors when investigating medication-related adverse events, increased the amount of nursing home quality data available to the public, and created new trainings for surveyors on unnecessary medication usage. However, other modifications reduced existing oversight activities. In 2015, GAO recommended that CMS monitor oversight modifications to better assess their effects; HHS agreed with the recommendation and told GAO they are beginning to take steps to address this issue. GAO maintains the importance of monitoring to help CMS better understand how its oversight modifications affect nursing home quality and to improve its oversight given limited resources. What GAO Recommends GAO has made numerous recommendations to CMS to improve its oversight of nursing home quality, including establishing a process to evaluate and prioritize website improvements and adding explanatory information about the Five-Star Quality Rating System to Nursing Home Compare. HHS agreed with the recommendations and in 2018 completed actions on these recommendations, but has not yet acted on the other recommendations, including providing national comparison information that GAO maintains are important to help enable consumers to understand nursing home quality and make distinctions between nursing homes.",
    "gao_GAO-19-120T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Defense (DOD) reported that more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty, and reductions in force structure have degraded military readiness. In response, the department has made rebuilding the readiness of the military forces a priority. The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes that restoring and retaining readiness across the entire spectrum of conflict is critical to success in the emerging security environment. Nevertheless, DOD reported readiness of the total military force remains low and has remained so since 2013. GAO has reported that Air Force readiness has steadily declined due to a persistent demand for forces, a decline in equipment availability and experienced maintenance personnel, the effect of high deployment rates on units' ability to conduct needed training, and a smaller inventory of aircraft. DOD has made department-wide progress in developing a plan to rebuild readiness of the military force. In August 2018, GAO reported that the Office of the Secretary of Defense has developed a Readiness Recovery Framework that the Department is using to guide the military services' efforts and plans to regularly assess, validate, and monitor readiness recovery. However, additional work remains to ensure that the actions DOD is taking will ultimately achieve overall readiness goals. This statement addresses (1) the challenges the Air Force faces in rebuilding the readiness of its existing fleet and (2) the extent to which the Air Force will be able to balance near-term readiness recovery with plans to grow and modernize the force. This statement is based on GAO's prior work on the Air Force and selected updates conducted in September 2018. What GAO Found The Air Force faces several interrelated management and readiness challenges in four interrelated areas\u2014personnel, equipment, training, and organization and utilization. Personnel: Pilot and Aircraft Maintainer Shortfalls Have Impeded Readiness Recovery The Air Force has reported that manpower shortfalls, particularly among skilled pilots and maintainers, are a primary challenge to rebuilding readiness. In April 2018, GAO reported that the Air Force had fewer fighter pilots than authorizations for 11 of those 12 years. This gap grew from 192 fighter pilots (5 percent of authorizations) in fiscal year 2006, to 1,005 (27 percent) in fiscal year 2017. The Air Force forecasted that the fighter pilot gap will persist over time, even as the Air Force takes steps to train more fighter pilots and improve retention. Equipment: Aircraft Availability Has Been Limited by Challenges associated with aging aircraft, maintenance, and supply support. The Air Force spends billions of dollars each year to sustain its fixed-wing aircraft fleet\u2014comprised of both legacy and new aircraft\u2014which needs expensive logistics support, including maintenance and repair, to meet its availability goals. GAO reported in September 2018 that from fiscal year 2011 through 2016, the Air Force generally did not meet aircraft availability goals while it continued to accrue increased maintenance costs. Sustainment challenges are not just an issue for older aircraft, but represent an enduring challenge for the Air Force. The F-35 Lightning II (F-35)\u2014which is intended to replace a variety of legacy fighter aircraft in the Air Force and more broadly represents the future of tactical aviation for DOD\u2014has projected sustainment costs of over $1 trillion over a 60-year life cycle. GAO reported in September 2018 that the F-35 fleet faced sustainment challenges that pose risks to its ability to meet current and future warfighter readiness requirements. The Air Force has identified the need to ensure a full-spectrum capable force that can successfully perform missions addressing a broad range of current and emerging threats; however, the Air Force has had difficulty training for full spectrum readiness. For more than a decade, the Air Force focused its training on supporting operations in the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan. Commanders established training requirements that they deemed necessary to prepare aircrews to conduct missions in these locations\u2014such as close air support-to-ground forces\u2014limiting training for other missions. GAO also reported in September 2016 that F-22 and F-35 squadrons faced training range limitations. F-22 squadron commanders told GAO that the airspace available limits their ability to train for their more complex missions, including offensive counter air and defensive counter air missions. GAO recommended that the Air Force reassess its annual training requirements and make any appropriate adjustments to its future training plans to ensure that its forces can accomplish a full range of missions. Organization and Utilization: Air Force management of its limited force structure can also exacerbate some of the problems discussed above, as GAO found for the F-22 fleet. The Air Force's management of its limited force structure can also exacerbate some of the problems discussed above, as GAO found for the F-22 fleet. The Air Force's management of its limited force structure can also exacerbate some of the problems discussed",
    "gao_GAO-18-197T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Select Agent Program, a joint program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Public Health and Safety (APHIS), oversees high-containment laboratories that handle pathogens. The program is a joint effort between CDC and APHIS. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which the Select Agent Program meets key elements of effective oversight and (2) approaches selected countries and regulatory sectors employ to promote effective oversight. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Select Agent Program: Strengthening Effective Oversight and Joint Strategic Planning Documents to Guide Its Efforts (GAO-17-68). What GAO Found The Select Agent Program does not fully meet key elements of effective oversight. In particular, the program has oversight shortcomings related to each of GAO's five key elements: independence, performing reviews, technical expertise, transparency, and enforcement. In addition, the program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan. It did, however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan during the summer of 2017. First, regarding independence, the Select Agent Program is not structurally distinct and separate from all of the laboratories it oversees because the two components of the Select Agent Program are located in CDC and APHIS, both of which also have high-containment laboratories registered with the program. Many experts at GAO's meeting and laboratory representatives GAO interviewed raised concerns that the Select Agent Program cannot be entirely independent in its oversight of CDC and APHIS laboratories because the Select Agent Program is composed of divisions of those agencies. To help reduce conflicts of interest, the program has taken steps such as having APHIS lead inspections of CDC laboratories. However, it has generally done so in response to concerns raised by others. Second, regarding the ability to perform reviews, the Select Agent Program performs several types of reviews to ensure compliance with regulatory and program requirements. However, the program may not target the highest-risk activities in its inspections, in part because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk to biological safety and security. For example, many experts at GAO's meeting and laboratory representatives GAO interviewed raised concerns about the amount of time inspectors spend assessing compliance with inventory controls (e.g., by counting and examining vials containing select agents) and reviewing inventory records during the inspection process, which takes time away from inspecting other aspects of biological safety and security.

    "gao_GAO-19-77": "Why GAO Did This Study Human trafficking is a serious problem in the world, involving more than 1.3 million people. The Departments of State (State), DOL, and USAID have programs that design and award counter-trafficking projects to implementing partners, such as trafficking victims. GAO was asked to review the effectiveness of these programs. This report (1) identifies recent projects in international counter-trafficking in persons that key U.S. agencies have awarded to implementing partners, and for selected projects, assesses the extent to which key agencies have documented their monitoring activities, ensured the reliability of the performance information they use in monitoring projects, and reviewed the usefulness of the performance indicators they use in monitoring projects. GAO reviewed agency policies and procedures, and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of five projects\u2014two State, one DOL, and two USAID\u2014that were active in fiscal year 2017. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State), Labor (DOL), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) fully documented their monitoring activities for all selected projects, but State did not fully document its monitoring activities for 16 of 37 (43 percent) of the projects GAO reviewed with project start dates between fiscal years 2011 to 2016. For example, State did not have nine monitoring plans, five complete progress reports, or targets for each indicator in six of seven final progress reports for projects that ended as of December 2017. Without timely documentation of the monitoring plans at the start of the project, State may not be able to ensure that projects are achieving their goals, as intended, from the beginning of project operations. For the six projects for which targets were not fully documented in the final progress reports, GAO found that targets were lacking for 110 of 253 (43 percent) of indicators across the six final progress reports. Without controls to ensure full documentation of monitoring activities and established performance targets, State is limited in its ability to assess project performance, including project efficiency or effectiveness. State and USAID do not have sufficient controls to ensure the reliability of the performance information they use in monitoring projects, while DOL had consistent and complete performance information in the project GAO reviewed. For example, GAO found that State and USAID used inconsistent and incomplete performance information to monitor these projects. For example, GAO found that quarterly totals differed from annual or cumulative totals reported separately on the same projects, and numbers reported in narrative information that differed from numbers reported as indicator values. In addition, GAO found that incomplete information, including narrative elements that were missing in whole or in part, was missing in whole or in part. State and USAID do not have sufficient controls to ensure the reliability of the performance information they use in monitoring projects, and both face challenges to data reliability stemming from information reported in non-standard formats, implementing partners with limited capacities to report performance information, and the time-consuming nature of reviewing reported information. Federal internal control standards state that management should obtain data from reliable internal and external sources. Without implementing additional controls to ensure that performance information are consistent and complete, State and USAID officials may not fully or accurately understand what projects are, or are not, achieving and, therefore, how their efforts could be altered as needed. Further, reports that are prepared or program decisions that are made using the TIP Office monitoring reports could be based on inconsistent or incomplete information that does not accurately present project results. State does not have a process to regularly review the number and content of indicators for counter-trafficking in persons projects to ensure that these indicators are useful and that collecting and reviewing information for them is not overly burdensome. State officials acknowledged there are too many indicators for many counter-trafficking in persons projects. However, project officers do not formally indicate which indicators they have determined are most useful and informed GAO that they have insufficient time and resources to do so as projects progress. Without a process to ensure that the number and content of counter-trafficking in persons project indicators are reviewed and modified as needed, project monitoring may be less efficient and effective as implementing partners and State TIP Office staff spend time collecting and reviewing indicator information that is not useful for project monitoring and management. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State and USAID (1) establish targets for each performance indicator; (2) ensure that the State TIP Office maintains documentation of all required monitoring activities; (3) ensure the reliability of the performance information they use in monitoring projects; and (4) establish additional controls to improve the consistency and completeness of performance information that USAID uses to monitor counter-trafficking in persons projects. State and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-678": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars each year to sustain its fixed-wing aircraft, which need expensive logistics support, including maintenance and repair, to meet availability goals. The Air Force and Navy share a variety of sustainment challenges, including the age of their aircraft as well as maintenance and supply support issues. These challenges have led to half (6 of 12) of the aircraft in GAO's review experiencing decreasing availability and to the aircraft in general not being able to meet aircraft availability goals. GAO was asked to review the Department of Defense's (DOD) efforts to sustain fixed-wing aircraft. This report examines (1) trends in aircraft availability and operating and support (O&S) costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, including whether the aircraft met availability goals; (2) the extent to which the Air Force and the Navy have sustainment strategies, regularly review sustainment metrics, and have plans to improve aircraft availability for the selected fixed-wing aircraft; and (3) the extent to which the Air Force and the Navy have sustainment strategies, regularly review sustainment metrics, and have plans to improve aircraft availability for the selected fixed-wing aircraft. GAO analyzed the Air Force and Navy data on aircraft availability and O&S costs, and interviewed officials. What GAO Found For the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in GAO's review, aircraft availability and O&S cost trends varied over the 6-year period between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, and the aircraft generally did not meet availability goals. GAO found that 6 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft\u20143 from each service\u2014experienced decreased aircraft availability between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. One aircraft met availability goals each year between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. Conversely, six aircraft met the goals in some years but not others, and five aircraft did not meet the goals in any year. In the latest year included in GAO's review\u2014fiscal year 2016\u20149 of 12 of the fixed-wing aircraft did not meet their associated availability goals. With respect to O&S costs, the overall O&S total for all 12 aircraft was about $20 billion annually over the 6-year period; some aircraft experienced increases while the costs to operate and support others decreased. The reasons for changes in costs included increases in maintenance costs for 8 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft. The Air Force and Navy share a variety of sustainment challenges, including the age of their aircraft as well as maintenance and supply support issues. These challenges have led to half (6 of 12) of the aircraft in GAO's review experiencing decreasing availability and to the aircraft in general not being able to meet aircraft availability goals. For example, 9 of 12 aircraft did not meet availability goals in fiscal year 2016. These trends are occurring even though the Air Force and Navy regularly review sustainment metrics for the aircraft and are implementing plans for improving aircraft availability. However, DOD's policy and the Navy's guidance are not clear on whether the services should have a current sustainment strategy for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and on whether the strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. Without clarity about whether the DOD instruction and the Navy guidance apply to legacy systems, program officials will not know whether they are required to have a sustainment strategy or are required to update the plan for their respective fixed-wing aircraft. Furthermore, the program offices, the services, and DOD may not have full visibility of necessary requirements to document program objectives, related risks, and the effectiveness of the program, ultimately jeopardizing the sustainability and affordability of each of the programs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD update or issue new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-33": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has a long-standing interest in preventing and responding to unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors. This report examines the extent to which (1) DOD has policies on sexual harassment that include CDC principles and relevant legislative elements and (2) DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on unwanted sexual behaviors. GAO compared DOD's policies with CDC's framework for preventing sexual violence and reviewed relevant legislative provisions and DOD guidance. GAO also interviewed officials from DOD and CDC. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies on sexual harassment that include some but not all of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) principles and most relevant legislative elements. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service-specific sexual harassment policies generally include prevention strategies that CDC has identified in its principles for sexual violence prevention but leave out risk and protective factors, as well as risk domains. Additionally, DOD's sexual harassment policies include most elements identified in section 579 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2013, but do not consistently include mechanisms for anonymous reporting. ODMEO officials stated that they plan to issue a new policy that is intended to focus on sexual harassment and other forms of harassment, but it is too early to know whether that policy will include all the CDC principles or mechanisms for anonymous reporting. GAO also noted during its review that most existing policies have not yet been updated to reflect a provision in the fiscal year 2017 NDAA that redefined sexual harassment for certain purposes so it is no longer defined solely as a form of sex discrimination but is recognized also as an adverse behavior on the spectrum of behaviors that can contribute to an increase in the incidence of sexual assault. DOD has processes for maintaining and reporting consistent data on unwanted sexual behaviors, but the department does not have similar assurance of consistent data on incidents of sexual harassment. The military services use centralized databases that enable them to maintain and report consistent data on those incidents that fall under their purview. In contrast, DOD relies on military service-specific databases on sexual harassment incidents and does not have assurance of consistent data from these databases because it has not established standard data elements and definitions to guide the military services in maintaining and reporting these data. DOD has several overarching efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors across the continuum of harm. Specifically, the department established an office to oversee the integration and coordination of unwanted sexual behaviors in 2015 and is in the process of developing an overarching prevention strategy. However, because the strategy is under development, it is unclear whether it will contain key elements for long-term and results-oriented strategic planning. DOD also has ongoing collaborative efforts to address unwanted sexual behaviors along the continuum of harm. Specifically, GAO identified 15 collaborative efforts, including regular meetings, Integrated Product Teams, and working groups that involve multiple entities that address unwanted sexual behaviors. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD fully include in its new policy for sexual harassment the principles in the CDC framework for sexual violence prevention, that DOD also include in the new sexual harassment policy mechanisms for anonymous reporting, and that DOD incorporate in its continuum of harm prevention strategy all the elements that are key for establishing a long-term, results-oriented strategic planning framework. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",

The Southwest border region is also a key location for U.S. businesses engaged in cross-border trade and for cross-border trade. BSA/AML requires banks to comply with BSA/AML requirements. GAO was asked to review the effects of BSA/AML on Southwest border customers. This report examines (1) the extent to which BSA/AML compliance challenges are affecting Southwest border customers, (2) the reasons banks terminate accounts and close branches, and (3) the extent to which federal banking regulators have assessed the BSA/AML factors influencing banks to close or terminate accounts. GAO surveyed a nationally representative sample of banks, econometric models, and discussions with bank representatives in three Southwest border communities selected based on geographic location, BSA/AML compliance efforts, and BSA/AML compliance costs. GAO also interviewed federal banking regulators, law enforcement officials, and representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of 19 Southwest border banks. What GAO Found Money laundering risk is high in the Southwest border region because of the high volume of cash transactions, the number of cross-border transactions, and foreign accountholders. Bank representatives GAO spoke with said that they manage these added BSA/AML compliance challenges through activities such as more frequent monitoring and investigating of suspicious activities, but that these efforts require an investment of resources. GAO's nationally representative survey found that most Southwest border banks terminated accounts for reasons related to money laundering (BSA/AML) risk from January 2014 through December 2016. GAO's econometric models generally found that money laundering-related risk factors were important predictors of national bank branch closures. GAO's econometric models also generally found that money laundering-related risk factors that could be reflective, in part, of BSA/AML compliance effort and risks, were an important predictor of national bank branch closures, and likely to have been relatively more important in the Southwest border region. The federal banking regulators have taken some actions in response to derisking, including issuing guidance and conducting some agency reviews. Regulators have also conducted retrospective reviews on some BSA/AML requirements. However, the actions regulators have taken to address derisking have focused primarily on the burden resulting from the filing of customer-related revenue reports (SAR) associated with the accounts. Without assessing the full range of BSA/AML factors that may be influencing banks to derisk or close branches, FinCEN, the federal banking regulators, and Congress do not have the information they need to determine if adjustments are needed to ensure that BSA/AML regulations and their implementation are achieving their regulatory objectives in the most effective and least burdensome way. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Director of FinCEN and the federal banking regulators jointly conduct a retrospective review of BSA/AML regulations and their implementation for banks. FinCEN and the federal banking regulators agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

In 2010, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a report describing several attacks using ICS associated with utility infrastructure. GAO was asked to review DOD's utilities privatization program. This report examines (1) the types of information the military departments have on their privatized utilities, (2) the extent to which the military departments have tracked utilities privatization contract performance or developed measurable performance standards, and (3) the extent to which DOD has implemented cybersecurity requirements for industrial control systems. GAO reviewed DOD guidance and policies and interviewed officials from the military departments, the Air Force, and the Army. GAO also reviewed nine contracts that privatized one utility system, and two contracts privatized two utility systems. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has some types of information about utility systems that have been privatized, but they have not tracked utilities privatization contract performance or developed measurable performance standards for these contracts. For example, the military departments have some information on the costs for utility infrastructure improvements and commodities, system reliability, and contractor performance evaluations. However, none of the military departments have determined whether the utilities privatization contracts are on track to achieve those cost avoidance estimates. For example, officials at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, estimated at the time of contract award that it would have cost the Army $61.4 million to provide natural gas utility services over the life of the utilities privatization contract, while the successful proposal from the contractor estimated a cost of $52.3 million for the same services. Therefore, the Army initially projected that it would avoid an estimated cost of $9.1 million for natural gas utility services at Fort Bragg over the life of the contract. However, the estimate at the time of contract award does not account for changes in the cost of the contract over time. Moreover, none of the military departments measure actual cost avoidance over time, and some utilities privatization contracts have experienced cost increases. For example, the contract to privatize electric and water services at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, had 59 modifications, which increased the total estimated contract value by more than 5 percent after adjusting for inflation. In addition, the water and wastewater privatization contract at Fort Bragg had 219 modifications, which has increased the total estimated contract value by 96 percent ($552 million to about $1.1 billion since it was awarded in September 2007. The military departments have not tracked utilities privatization contract performance or developed measurable performance standards because the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (ASD (EI&E)) has not issued guidance requiring the military departments to develop metrics and measurable performance standards. Without issuing guidance that requires the military departments and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to develop and implement metrics and measurable performance standards to track contract performance for future utilities privatization contracts and to develop similar guidance for current utilities privatization contracts, the department will lack information on the performance of utilities privatization contracts. As a result, ASD (EI&E), the military departments, and DLA may not be able to perform effective program management and oversight for these long-term utilities privatization contracts. DOD has cybersecurity requirements for industrial control systems, but has not begun to implement those requirements for utilities privatization contracts. DOD has a Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clause to require that contractors take steps to ensure safeguards are put in place to protect covered defense information. DOD officials stated that they have taken steps to incorporate the clause requiring the safeguarding of covered defense information into many of their utilities privatization contracts, but they have not begun to implement the cybersecurity requirement for those contracts. For example, DLA officials stated that they interpreted DLA-contracting guidance issued in 2015 to direct them to incorporate the clause into all contracts. DLA officials stated that they have not begun to implement the cybersecurity requirement for those contracts because they are waiting for ASD (EI&E) officials to issue procedures concerning how the military departments are to determine what, if any, covered defense information associated with utilities privatization contracts is provided or developed by the contractor in performance of the contract. Without procedures concerning how the military departments are to determine what, if any, covered defense information is provided to or developed by the contractor in the performance of the utilities privatization contract, the military departments and DLA may not be able to adequately and consistently protect DOD's information associated with utilities privatization contracts. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense issue guidance requiring the military departments and DLA to develop and implement metrics and measurable performance standards to track utilities privatization contract performance for future contracts and to develop similar guidance for current contracts. DOD concurred with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-515": "Why GAO Did This Study USPS is the world's largest mail carrier, with about 1.2 billion pieces of mail delivered each year. USPS's capital spending is intended to help sustain its operations and meet its universal service obligation. USPS has processes for setting an annual capital spending budget and approving specific projects. GAO was asked to review USPS's capital spending. This report (1) describes USPS's projected capital spending over the next 10 years and (2) assesses whether USPS's processes support its ability to address uncertainties and risks that affect its capital spending. GAO reviewed USPS's capital spending processes and interviewed USPS officials. GAO also reviewed USPS documentation on its capital-spending processes. What GAO Found The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) projects an annual average of about $2.4 billion in capital spending from fiscal years 2018 through 2028\u2014about 70 percent more than the average of $1.4 billion from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. USPS projects an annual average of about $821 million in capital spending for vehicles, facilities, information technology, and mail processing equipment. While some of USPS's planned capital spending is intended specifically to generate a return-on-investment\u2014such as by increasing revenues or decreasing costs\u2014much of USPS's planned capital spending is to help sustain operations. Specifically, roughly 80 percent of USPS's projected capital spending for fiscal year 2018 is for projects intended to help sustain operations. USPS projects an annual average of about $607 million in capital spending for facilities from fiscal years 2018 through 2028. USPS officials said that USPS faces little need for capital spending on new facility construction given changes to USPS's business such as decreasing mail volumes. As a result, most of USPS's projected capital spending is for rehabilitation and repair of existing facilities, such as the replacement of roofs or heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems needed to sustain operations. USPS projects an annual average of about $541 million in capital spending for information technology and other capital projects, such as customer support equipment, from fiscal years 2018 through 2028. USPS officials said that while it is difficult to project capital spending on information technology because future needs are uncertain, they can more accurately predict some future needs, such as hardware replacement. USPS has processes that can help it identify uncertainties and risks that could affect its capital spending and adjust its spending to changing circumstances. USPS has processes for identifying and analyzing organizational uncertainties, such as business and budgetary uncertainties, which can affect capital spending. USPS has processes for identifying and analyzing project-specific risks through the use of Decision Analysis Reports (DARs). USPS's capital-spending processes align with aspects of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's (COSO) internal control framework, which states that organizations should identify uncertainties and risks to the achievement of their objectives and analyze these uncertainties and risks to determine how they should be managed. USPS has processes for identifying and analyzing project-specific risks through the use of DARs. USPS officials said USPS seeks to minimize the budgetary uncertainty that capital spending will outpace available resources by developing its annual capital-spending budget as part of USPS's overall annual budget. As a result, USPS can determine an annual capital spending budget based on the most recent conditions, including the most recent revenue forecasts, and consider possible tradeoffs\u2014such as those between capital spending and other spending needs such as operating expenses. USPS may approve less capital spending for capital projects than budgeted for at the start of the year. USPS officials said USPS may shift strategic priorities based on business conditions and cancel or delay some planned projects that it determines are no longer aligned with its priorities. In other instances, USPS's capital-spending approval process provides flexibility to re-allocate capital funds as USPS identifies and assesses changing conditions that affect the organization, or when contingencies or emergencies arise. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. USPS provided a draft of this report to GAO for review and comment. USPS provided no comments.",

From fiscal years 1996 through 2016, an average of 15 percent of individual offenders and 32 percent of organizational offenders were ordered to pay restitution by the federal courts. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified various factors related to the potential expansion of federal courts' authority to order restitution in the four areas listed in the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016: (1) to apply to victims who have suffered harm, injury, or loss that would not have occurred but for the defendant's related conduct; (2) in the case of an offense resulting in the victim's death, to allow the court to use its discretion to award the income lost by the victim's surviving family members or estate as a result of the victim's death; (3) to require that the defendant pay to the victim an amount determined by the court to restore the victim to the position he or she would have been in had the defendant not committed the offense; and (4) to require the defendant compensate the victim for any injury, harm, or loss, including emotional distress, that occurred as a result of the offense. Stakeholders also identified additional factors to consider, beyond the ones identified for the four provisions above, for potential broadening of federal courts' authority to order restitution generally.

    "gao_GAO-18-234T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for IT in fiscal year 2018. However, as GAO has previously reported, investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. In February 2015, GAO reported that, while progress had been made in improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, significant work still remained to be completed. GAO was asked to testify on the status of FITARA. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which agencies have implemented FITARA, and (2) the extent to which agencies have implemented GAO's prior recommendations to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports and testimonies on FITARA, as well as selected updates conducted in August 2017 on the status of GAO's 2017 high-risk series. GAO reviewed FITARA and related guidance, and interviewed officials from OMB and agencies. What GAO Found The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2010 (FITARA) was intended to improve agencies' acquisitions of information technology (IT) and enable Congress to monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The law includes specific requirements related to seven areas. For example, the law requires OMB to develop a goal for how much is to be saved through this initiative, and provide annual reports on cost savings achieved.

    "gao_GAO-18-418": "Why GAO Did This Study IRS is responsible for ensuring that taxpayers are able to access sensitive information, such as their Social Security number, when they apply for a tax refund. IRS authenticates taxpayers to provide reasonable assurance that it is interacting with the legitimate taxpayer. For example, IRS authenticates taxpayers via telephone, online, in-person, or correspondence. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to address its authentication challenges. This report examines (1) the taxpayer interactions that require authentication, including the general rationale behind the requirements, and IRS's authentication methods; (2) what IRS is doing to monitor and improve its authentication methods, both internally and collaboratively through the Security Summit, to secure taxpayer information and reduce identity theft refund fraud; and (3) what else, if anything, IRS can do to strengthen its authentication methods while improving services to taxpayers. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials, representatives from industry and financial institutions, and government officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers risks to both the taxpayer and IRS when making decisions about how to approach authentication, which is consistent with federal guidelines. In making these decisions, IRS considers how individuals would be affected by the unauthorized release of sensitive information. IRS also considers the impact on the agency, including the potential for financial loss or harm to IRS programs or services, and loss of public trust. IRS has made progress on its authentication efforts, but has not prioritized improvements and is not sufficiently assessing and monitoring risks for all channels. For example, IRS has not established a policy for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence authentication channels. Further, IRS does not have effective internal controls for collecting reliable, useful data on telephone, in-person, and correspondence authentication outcomes for the Taxpayer Protection Program (TPP), one of IRS's key defenses against identity theft refund fraud. IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement new guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on online authentication, but does not have a timeline or detailed plans for fully implementing the new guidance. NIST's guidance is designed to (1) describe the risk management process for selecting appropriate digital identity services and (2) help agencies implement authentication programs that provide reasonable risk-based assurances that a returning user is the same user that previously accessed the service. IRS officials stated that they intend to develop its implementation roadmap through 2018 and begin implementing technical solutions in 2019. However, IRS has not yet established detailed plans, including timelines, milestone dates, and resource needs, for fully implementing the new guidance. IRS officials cited several reasons for the delay. They said the agency will have to balance maintaining current authentication programs with developing IT infrastructure to support technologies that are compliant with the new guidance. In addition, officials stated that they will need to take a slower, incremental approach to updating authentication programs because of resource constraints. IRS officials stated that one way the agency evaluates potential technologies is through limited pilots or innovation studies. However, IRS officials could not provide documentation on more recent evaluations of the broader authentication environment, or evidence of a repeatable, comprehensive process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS (1) prioritize foundational initiatives and (2) develop a plan for fully implementing NIST's new guidance and make the necessary improvements to its systems. IRS agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-27": "Why GAO Did This Study The Army's financial statements are the primary financial statements of the U.S. government. The Army's financial statements are auditable by the Department of Defense (DOD) because they are based on the Army's general fund. In 2015, DOD created the Working Group to develop solutions to reduce the number of required JVs and reduce or eliminate the number of unsupported JVs that affect the Army's general fund. GAO was asked to review the Working Group's efforts to address unsupported JVs. This report addresses the extent to which (1) the Working Group has performed analyses to determine the root causes of unsupported JVs and (2) the Working Group has developed and monitored the implementation of corrective action plans to address identified root causes of unsupported JVs. GAO reviewed relevant reports and reports by DOD and DOD's Office of the Inspector General and interviewed Army and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) officials. What GAO Found The Journal Voucher Working Group (Working Group) has been actively working toward implementing new processes to support journal vouchers (JV) and eliminate unsupported JVs in the Army's general fund. From October 2016 to March 2017, the Working Group, based on DFAS-produced metrics, reported that it had identified more than 121,000 unsupported JVs totaling $455 billion. The Working Group prioritized its identifying of root causes of unsupported JVs based upon factors such as potential correction complexity, materiality, and volume. In the May 2017 FIAR Plan Status Report, DOD stated that the Army had completed its root cause analyses for all JVs. However, GAO found that the analyses have been performed on only a small percentage of the total number of unsupported JVs that existed as of March 2017 and cannot be considered completed for all unsupported JVs. In addition, members of the Working Group confirmed as of June 2017 that the Working Group has not yet performed all analyses necessary and stated that the Working Group's efforts will be an ongoing, iterative process because of anticipated new challenges that continually arise from new business processes or programs. As of March 2017, the Working Group had not included in its root cause analyses (1) any unsupported JVs at the transaction level, such as within the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS), which are mostly attributed to year-end closing accounting entries; (2) any unsupported JVs within the Defense Departmental Reporting System-Budgetary (DDRS-AFS), which are used to prepare the financial statements; or (3) system-generated JVs. As a result, a significant amount of analyses remains to fully identify root causes and ultimately correct the Army's overall unsupported JV issue. As of March 2017, members of the Working Group reported that the Working Group had developed 38 corrective action plans to address all of the identified root causes of unsupported manual JVs at the consolidated level in DDRS-B for the Army's general fund. According to these members, of the 38 corrective action plans developed, 18 have been implemented. In addition, because the root cause analyses have been limited, the Working Group has not yet been able to determine how many more corrective action plans will need to be developed to resolve the unsupported JV issue. Further, GAO found that the Working Group's monitoring of corrective action plan implementation does not include a method that sufficiently identifies the progress that has been made toward fully addressing the issue of unsupported JVs or to what extent each implemented corrective action plan has reduced unsupported JVs. In addition, GAO found that the Working Group's monitoring of corrective action plan implementation does not include a method that sufficiently identifies the progress that has been made toward fully addressing the issue of unsupported JVs or to what extent each implemented corrective action plan has reduced unsupported JVs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Working Group (1) identifie and analyze the full population of manual unsupported JVs at the transaction level and in DDRS-B and determine the root causes for these JVs; and (2) work with DFAS to enhance the monthly JV metrics report or develop another method to sufficiently monitor the extent to which the Working Group has identified the root causes of unsupported JVs and to determine the extent to which unsupported JVs are being reduced based on the implemented corrective actions. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-387": "Why GAO Did This Study Puerto Rico is the largest and most populous territory of the United States. Puerto Rico's economy has experienced year-over-year declines in real output in all but two years, as measured by real gross domestic product (GDP). The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) was enacted in June 2016 to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis. PROMESA requires GAO to report on the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt. This report describes (1) the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt; and (2) federal actions that could address the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt. GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts. GAO also reviewed Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt. What GAO Found Puerto Rico's government has operated with a deficit\u2014where expenses exceed revenues\u2014in each fiscal year since 2002, and its deficits grew over time. To cope with its deficits, Puerto Rico issued debt to finance operations, rather than reduce its fiscal gap by cutting spending, raising taxes, or both. Through interviews with current and former Puerto Rico officials, federal officials, and other relevant experts, as well as a review of relevant literature, GAO identified three groups of factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's persistent deficits: (1) inadequate financial management and oversight practices, (2) policy decisions, and (3) prolonged economic contraction. Some of the factors in these groups may be interrelated. For example, GAO found that Puerto Rico's municipal bonds were attractive to investors because interest on the bonds was not subjected to federal, state, or local taxes, regardless of where the investors resided. In contrast, investors may be required to pay state or local taxes on interest income earned from municipal securities issued by a state or municipality in which they do not reside. In addition, Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (GDB) provided an intragovernmental source of financing. GDB issued loans to Puerto Rico's government agencies and public corporations to support their operations. GDB also provided loans to Puerto Rico's government agencies and public corporations to support their operations. GAO identified three potential federal actions that could help address some of the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's unsustainable debt levels. Consistent with the provision in PROMESA that was the statutory requirement for this work, GAO focused on actions that would not increase the federal deficit. There are tradeoffs for policymakers to consider when deciding whether or how to implement any policy. For each action, GAO describes a specific challenge as it relates to debt accumulation in Puerto Rico, identify a possible federal response, and describe other considerations for policymakers.",
    "gao_GAO-18-9": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for coordinating the nation's response to distressed mariners. The Coast Guard's boat stations, air stations, and air facilities are subject to laws that require the Coast Guard to maintain specific minimum capabilities, such as a requirement to maintain at least one vessel at each station that is fully capable of operating within the prevailing weather and marine conditions in that station's area of responsibility. The Coast Guard has a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat stations and the results identified unnecessary duplication. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guard's efforts to close unneeded stations. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard has a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat stations, (2) the extent to which the Coast Guard has a sound process to analyze the need for its air stations and air facilities, and (3) the extent to which the Coast Guard has taken actions to implement the results of its analyses of its need for its boat stations. GAO reviewed laws, policies, and procedures related to its search and rescue (SAR) mission; analyzed Coast Guard data on SAR cases conducted by selected stations; and interviewed Coast Guard officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) has a sound process for analyzing the need for its boat stations that is consistent with GAO's Program Evaluation guidance, which calls for choosing well-regarded criteria against which to make comparisons in order to achieve strong, defensible conclusions. The primary criteria Coast Guard subject matter experts established, consistent with statutory requirements that the Coast Guard make a determination that adequate SAR coverage would remain in place, were (1) a minimum threshold of overlapping SAR coverage had to be maintained and (2) the Coast Guard's ability to meet its nationwide 2-hour SAR response standard had to be maintained. By applying these criteria, the Coast Guard's process identified overlapping search and rescue coverage where three or more stations can respond to a single SAR case within 2 hours, and unnecessary duplication where stations could be closed without negatively impacting the Coast Guard's ability to meet mission requirements, such as its 2-hour SAR response standard. The Coast Guard hired a contractor to carry out the analysis and identify potential cost savings from permanent closures of such stations. Although focused on SAR coverage, the process also included consideration of all Coast Guard missions carried out at these stations. The contractor followed the 9-step process, with certain steps conducted by the Coast Guard\u2014such as step 1, which analyzed the system and identified overlapping SAR coverage\u2014and developed and ranked different closure options to maximize cost savings. Coast Guard officials provided additional district input on unique characteristics of certain stations to further refine the closure options. The final study identified 18 stations for closure that it estimated would achieve cost savings without impeding the Coast Guard's ability to meet its SAR response standard and carry out its other missions. The Coast Guard's 2013 analysis identified unnecessary duplication and recommended certain stations for potential closure; however, as of August 2017 the Coast Guard had not closed any stations, nor developed a plan with time frames for closing stations. In their input to the station optimization process, Coast Guard officials in affected districts supported recommended station closures to achieve operational improvements, and Coast Guard leadership continues to believe the study results are valid. Implementing station closures could also result in costs savings. The Coast Guard has not taken action to implement the results of its analyses which recommended closures even though it has completed requirements to pursue station closures in District 9. Officials stated that the Coast Guard has not implemented the results of its sound process because past station closure efforts have been met with resistance from affected communities. As a result, Coast Guard leadership decided to pursue a more cautious approach by maintaining seasonal daily operations rather than closing stations outright as recommended in multiple analyses. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for agencies to have policies and procedures for ensuring that findings of audits or other reviews, such as the Coast Guard's 2013 station optimization study, are promptly resolved. By executing decisions to close stations based on the results of its analyses and developing a plan with milestones to execute actions it has identified to address unnecessary duplication, the Coast Guard will be better positioned to follow through with both permanent and seasonal closures of unnecessary stations, can improve its operational and training proficiency by consolidating the remaining stations' workloads to allow for sufficient training, and may realize cost savings. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Coast Guard establish and follow a sound air station optimization process similar to its process for analyzing boat stations, establish a plan with target dates and milestones for closing boat stations, and take action to close the stations identified according to its plan and target dates. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concurred with GAO",
    "gao_GAO-18-609SP": "Why GAO Did This Study GAO has designated federal performance management as a governmentwide high-risk area since 1997. GAO has reported that agencies have not consistently applied performance information to improve their management and results. GPRAMA requires OMB to develop cross-agency priority (CAP) goals to improve the performance and management of the federal government. GAO was asked to review the use of performance information by federal managers. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the reported use of performance information and related leading practices at 24 agencies has changed compared to GAO's prior survey in 2013; (2) managers' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed at individual agencies; and (3) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance agencies' use of performance information in various decision-making activities. GAO analyzed agency-level data from GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers at 24 agencies, and interviewed OMB and PIC staff. What GAO Found GAO's 2017 survey of federal managers at 24 agencies found that the reported use of performance information and related leading practices at most agencies has not changed since 2013. At the agency level, 3 of the 24 agencies had statistically significant changes in their index scores\u20141 increase (National Science Foundation) and 2 decreases (Social Security Administration and the Office of Personnel Management). Also, in 2017, 6 agencies had results that were statistically significantly different\u20144 higher and 2 lower\u2014than the government-wide average. Throughout the report, GAO highlights two different types of statistically significant results\u2014changes from GAO's last survey in 2013 and differences from the 2017 government-wide average. The former indicates when an agency's reported use of performance information or leading practices has measurably improved or declined. The latter indicates when it is statistically significantly higher or lower than the rest of government. These results suggest agencies have taken actions that led to improvements in their use of performance information. For example, when a result is a statistically significant increase since 2013, as with the National Science Foundation index score in 2017, this suggests that the agency has adopted practices that led to a measurable increase in the use of performance information by managers. When a result is statistically significantly higher than the government-wide average, like the General Services Administration's 2017 index score, this suggests that the agency's use of performance information is among the highest results when compared to the rest of government. These agencies could also have insights into practices that led to relatively high levels of performance information use. Finally, when a result is a statistically significant decrease since 2013, as with the Social Security Administration's index score in 2017, or statistically significantly lower than the government-wide average, this suggests the agencies face challenges that are hampering their ability to use performance information. GAO's 2017 survey results show that managers who reported their programs were subject to data-driven reviews, which are intended to assess progress towards achieving agency priority goals through data-driven reviews. GAO's survey results also indicate that managers who reported their programs were subject to these reviews to a greater extent. GAO's survey results suggest that limited actions have been taken to diffuse processes and practices related to the use of performance information to lower levels within federal agencies, where mid-level and senior managers make decisions about managing programs and operations. OMB staff agreed that diffusing processes and practices to lower levels could lead to improved use of performance information, but they told GAO they have not directed agencies to do so for a few reasons. For example, OMB staff expressed concerns about potentially imposing a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach on agencies. GAO agrees that it makes sense for agencies to tailor their approaches for those reasons. Moreover, given the long-standing and cross-cutting nature of this challenge, a government-wide approach also would provide a consistent focus on improving the use of performance information more extensively within agencies. The President's Management Agenda and its related CAP goal to leverage data as a strategic asset present an opportunity to do so, as it aims to improve data-driven decision making. As OMB and its fellow goal leaders more fully develop the action plan for achieving this goal, providing additional details for its plans to improve data-driven decision making would help provide assurance that it can be achieved. As part of those initiatives, GAO's survey results could provide a useful guide for targeting efforts. Officials at each agency could use these results to identify areas for additional analysis and potential actions that could help improve the use of performance information across the agency and at lower levels. Similarly, OMB and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) could use the results to identify broader issues in need of government-wide attention. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB (1) provide additional details on improving the use of data, including performance information,",

The Bureau plans to rely heavily on both new and legacy IT systems and infrastructure to support the 2018 End-to-End Test and the 2020 Census operations. GAO was asked to testify on the Bureau's progress in implementing the 2020 Census. This statement addresses (1) key risks facing the Bureau in conducting the 2020 Census, (2) the Bureau's challenges in implementing and securing IT systems, and (3) the Bureau's progress in developing a quality cost estimate for the 2020 Census. This statement is based on GAO's ongoing work and selected updates from the Bureau and Department of Commerce. What GAO Found GAO added the 2020 Census to its list of high-risk programs in February, 2017, because (1) innovations never before used in prior enumerations will not be fully tested; (2) the Bureau continues to face challenges in implementing and securing IT systems; and (3) the Bureau needs to control any further cost growth and develop reliable cost estimates.

What GAO Recommends GAO has made 84 recommendations to the Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau aimed at helping the Bureau prepare for and implement a successful 2020 Census. The Department has generally agreed with these recommendations; however 36 of them had not been implemented as of October 2017. GAO has designated 20 of these recommendations as a priority for the Department of Commerce and 5 have been implemented. In August 2017, GAO sent the Secretary of Commerce a letter that identified 20 of these recommendations at the Department, 15 of which concern the 2020 Census. GAO believes that attention to these recommendations is essential for a cost-effective enumeration. The Department and the Bureau have taken some actions to address these recommendations; however, a large number of recommendations remain open.",

    "gao_GAO-18-112": "Why GAO Did This Study The UPU established the terminal dues system to pay designated postal operators in countries where most of the mail originates. The UPU limits the rates through caps and floors to minimize year-over-year variability. The UPU also established ECOs, which collect, transport, and deliver documents and packages sent to the United States from other countries. The UPU has proposed changes to the terminal dues system. GAO was asked to review the effects of the current system. This report describes (1) the current rates under the current system, (2) planned changes to those rates, and (3) alternatives to the terminal dues system. GAO analyzed USPS data on inbound and outbound international mail volume, costs, and revenue from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and interviewed UPS, PRC, and State officials and industry group representatives. GAO also reviewed relevant studies and interviewed stakeholders. What GAO Found The current terminal dues system benefits the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) despite losses on inbound mail and has mixed effects on other U.S. stakeholders. USPS data show that the current terminal dues system has generated positive net revenue from all terminal dues mail, which has increased from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. This occurred even though losses from inbound mail more than doubled from $66 million to $135 million from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016. This increase in net revenue came despite a decrease in outbound terminal dues mail volume over the same period. The current terminal dues system also creates competitive disadvantages for other U.S. stakeholders. For example, ECOs, which collect, transport, and deliver documents and packages sent to the United States from other countries, are not part of the terminal dues system and do not have access to terminal dues rates. The current terminal dues system also creates competitive disadvantages for other U.S. stakeholders. For example, ECOs compete with designated postal operators for business from countries with relatively low terminal dues rates, such as many countries in Asia. U.S. businesses that compete with foreign companies that use inbound terminal dues mail are also disadvantaged by the current terminal dues system. The projected increase in terminal dues rates caused by the planned changes to the terminal dues system may negatively affect U.S. businesses that send outbound terminal dues mail and U.S. consumers. U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers that send mail to other countries will pay higher postage rates for terminal dues mail, to the extent that USPS increases its prices to reflect the higher terminal dues USPS must pay to designated postal operators. However, increased terminal dues rates may still be less than the cost to deliver that mail for designated postal operators in relatively high cost countries, such as Norway and Germany. U.S. consumers may also see shipping prices increase for inbound terminal dues mail, for example e-commerce packets, to the extent that any increases in postage charged to foreign mailers resulting from increased terminal dues rates are passed along to U.S. consumers. USPS officials stated that alternatives to the terminal dues system generate increased net revenue for USPS, such as higher rates for different mail products (inbound and outbound) with desirable features not available for terminal dues mail, such as tracking and faster delivery. However, the effects of the alternatives on other U.S. stakeholders are unclear. For example, the effects of the alternatives on ECOs are unclear because USPS considers the rates to be proprietary information that is not publicly available. The effects of the alternatives on other U.S. stakeholders, such as U.S. businesses that are affected by inbound or outbound international mail, are also unclear. For example, the effects of the alternatives on other U.S. businesses that are affected by inbound or outbound international mail are also unclear.

    "gao_GAO-19-208SP": "Why GAO Did This Study The state and local government sector is the largest consumer of federal funds and is expected to spend about $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2067. The sector's operating balance is a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of current receipts. GAO was asked to update its model to assess the long-term fiscal outlook of the sector. This report examines (1) the long-term fiscal outlook of the sector and (2) the factors that could affect the sector's long-term fiscal outlook. GAO simulated the sector's operating balance, net saving, and net lending or borrowing. GAO also developed simulations using alternative assumptions of the growth of key model variables. GAO analyzed data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds (OASDI Trustees). GAO also interviewed officials from CBO, CMS, and the OASDI Trustees. What GAO Found GAO's simulations suggest that the state and local government sector will likely continue to face a difference between revenue and spending during the next 50 years. This long-term outlook is measured by the operating balance\u2014a measure of the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of current receipts. While both expenditures and revenues are projected to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) during the simulation period, a difference between the two is projected to persist because expenditures are generally expected to grow at a faster rate than revenues. GAO's simulations suggest that the fiscal gap is about 14.7 percent of total expenditures or about 2.4 percent of GDP. That is, assuming no change in projected total revenues, eliminating the difference between the sector's expenditures and revenues during the 50-year simulation period would likely require action to be taken today, and maintained for each year equivalent to a 14.7 percent reduction in the sector's total expenditures. Alternatively, assuming no change in projected total expenditures, closing the fiscal gap by increasing revenue would also likely require actions of similar magnitude. GAO's simulations suggest that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures. These expenditures are projected to increase from about 4.1 percent of GDP in 2018 to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2067. Two types of health care expenditures\u2014Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees\u2014will likely constitute a growing expenditure for state and local governments during the simulation period. Medicaid expenditures are projected to rise, on average, by 1 percentage point more than GDP each year. Growth in these health benefits also reflects growth in the projected number of employees and retirees and growth in the projected amount of health benefits for each employee and retiree. Growth in these health benefits also reflects growth in the projected number of employees and retirees and growth in the projected amount of health benefits for each employee and retiree. While GAO's long-term simulations do not account for pending or future federal policy changes that will result in changes to expenditures and revenues, an understanding of several recent federal policy changes related to taxes and health care are important to note because they present sources of uncertainty for the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook. In addition, as is the case in any model that is reliant on historical data to simulate a long-term outlook, other considerations, such as economic growth and rates of return on pension assets, could shift future fiscal outcomes. These policy changes and uncertainties are discussed below and may help federal policy makers and state and local governments consider how these changes could affect the long-term outlook.",
    "gao_GAO-19-223": "Why GAO Did This Study EM is responsible for safely cleaning up radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, and environmental contamination from 50 years of federal nuclear weapons production and energy research. EM's mission includes completing its cleanup work in a way that reduces associated risks and costs. GAO was asked to review EM's cleanup work. This report examines (1) how EM manages its cleanup work, (2) the extent to which EM's cleanup policy follows selected program and project management leading practices, and (3) how EM measures the overall performance of its operations activities. GAO reviewed EM's cleanup policy, analyzed EM's fiscal year 2019 budget data, and interviewed DOE and EM officials. What GAO Found The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) manages most of its multibillion-dollar cleanup work as operations activities, posing cost and schedule risks. These risks stem from EM's management of such work using less stringent requirements than for capital asset projects even though EM spends billions of dollars annually on operations activities. EM's 2017 cleanup policy, which governs the EM program and its operations activities, does not follow most selected leading practices for program and project management. For example, EM's 2017 cleanup policy does not follow any of 9 selected program management leading practices related to scope, cost, schedule performance, and independent reviews. EM's 2017 cleanup policy follows 3 of 12 selected project management leading practices related to these areas; it does not follow the remaining 9. EM uses three tools to measure the overall performance of its operations activities, but these tools do not provide a clear picture of overall performance. These tools are earned value management (EVM), performance metrics, and milestones, according to EM documentation and officials. However, EM has not followed (i.e., has not met, has minimally met, or has partially met) best practices for its contractors' EVM systems; EM's performance metrics do not link performance to cost; and EM postpones milestones when they are at risk of missing them and does not consistently track or report those milestone changes over time. Until EM updates its cleanup policy to require that EVM systems be maintained and used in a way that follows EVM best practices, EM leadership may not have access to reliable performance data to make informed decisions in managing its cleanup work and to provide to Congress and other stakeholders on billions of dollars' worth of cleanup work every year. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EM (1) work together to establish requirements for classifying cleanup work as capital asset projects or operations activities, and (2) assess EM's ongoing operations activities to determine if they should be reclassified as capital asset projects based on the newly established requirements. DOE generally agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

In some cases, DOD may elect to use LPTA procedures, which are based on a tradeoff between cost and price. Section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to revise the Defense Finance and Accounting Standards Regulations (DFARS) to require that LPTA procedures be used in situations where there would not be any value on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. Section 813 also established that implementing revisions to the DFARS were to be completed within 120 days of enactment of the NDAA, but the revisions had not been put in place as of October 2017.

GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 7 contracts valued at $10 million or more that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017 and interviewed DOD officials. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD had no comments on the draft report. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) rarely used LPTA source selection procedures for new contracts valued at $10 million or more that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017. GAO's analysis found that the three military departments awarded 781 new contracts valued at $10 million or more during this time frame. Of these 781 contracts, 133 were awarded for information technology and support services. However, only 9 of the 133 contracts used LPTA source selection procedures. Contracting officials cited a number of factors that were considered when determining to use LPTA procedures in the 7 selected contracts GAO reviewed. For all of the contracts, officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. For these contracts, contracting officials also stated that LPTA procedures were used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring.

    "gao_GAO-18-130": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD relies extensively on IT to support its business functions. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016 included provisions requiring DOD to perform certain activities aimed at ensuring that its business system investments are managed efficiently and effectively. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to manage its business systems. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) established guidance for effectively managing its defense business, (2) developed and maintained a defense business enterprise architecture and information technology (IT) enterprise architecture, (3) used the Defense Business Council to provide advice to the Secretary on developing the business enterprise architecture, reengineering the department's business processes, developing and deploying business systems, and developing requirements for business systems, and (4) ensured that covered business systems are reviewed and certified in accordance with the act. GAO reviewed DOD's guidance, as well as the guidance established by the Air Force, Army, and Navy for managing defense business systems relative to the act's requirements. GAO also interviewed cognizant officials responsible for managing defense business system investments at DOD, including the military departments. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to comply with provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 related to defense business system investments. Specifically, as called for in the act, the department has established guidance that addresses most legislative requirements for managing its defense business systems; however, the military departments are still developing guidance to fully address certification requirements for their systems. Further, DOD has developed a business enterprise architecture and is in the process of updating the architecture to improve its content. The department also has a plan to improve the usefulness of the business enterprise architecture; however, the department has not delivered the plan's intended capabilities. In addition, the department is in the process of updating its IT enterprise architecture; however, it does not have a plan for improving the department's IT and computing infrastructure for each of the major business processes. Further, the department has not yet demonstrated that the business enterprise architecture and the IT enterprise architecture are integrated. The department fully addressed the act's requirement related to defense business system oversight. Specifically, the department's governance board, called the Defense Business Council, addressed legislative provisions to provide advice to the Secretary. Lastly, DOD and the military departments did not apply new legislative requirements when certifying business systems for fiscal year 2017. Instead, the DOD DCMO certified the systems in GAO's sample (which included the military departments' systems) in accordance with the previous fiscal year's (fiscal year 2016) certification requirements. Those requirements had stipulated that a defense business system program was to be reviewed and certified on the basis of the system's compliance with the business enterprise architecture and appropriate business process reengineering, rather than on the basis of having met all five requirements identified in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016.

GAO was asked to review the IG Act. This report addresses (1) the status of IG vacancies as of the end of fiscal year 2017, and the number and duration of the IG vacancies for fiscal years 2007 through 2016, and (2) the views of the IG community on the impacts, if any, of IG vacancies on the Offices of Inspector General's (OIG) ability to effectively carry out their duties, including views on independence and permanent IG suggestions for improvements in the appointment process. GAO analyzed vacancy data from the 64 OIGs established under the IG Act, and surveyed the acting IGs and OIG employees who worked under an acting IG. GAO also interviewed the permanent IGs and OIG employees who worked under an acting IG. What GAO Found As of September 30, 2017, there were 12 IG vacancies in the 64 Offices of Inspector General (OIG) established under the IG Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act). Over the 10-year period covering fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the total number of IG vacancies varied with a low of 6 total vacancies as of the end of fiscal year 2007 to a high of 11 vacancies as of the end of fiscal years 2009, 2014, and 2016. In addition, some OIGs experienced prolonged continuous vacancies ranging from over 1 year to approximately 6 years. The number of vacancies at the end of fiscal years 2007 through 2016 ranged from 6 to 11 vacancies.

    "gao_GAO-18-182": "Why GAO Did This Study The 21st Century Cures Act requires BOP to define serious mental illness and identify an identical set of BOP inmates with serious mental illness for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The act also requires GAO to report on the effects of incarceration and reentry on recidivism. This report addresses (1) the population of BOP inmates with serious mental illness and the types of crimes committed by BOP inmates without serious mental illness, (2) what is known about the costs to the federal and selected state governments to incarcerate and provide mental health services to incarcerated individuals with serious mental illness, and (3) what strategies for reducing recidivism among individuals with serious mental illness have been identified by the federal and selected state governments and in literature. GAO analyzed BOP and state data on the population of inmates with serious mental illness, the most recent fiscal years for which data on these criteria are available, and the most common types of crimes committed by BOP inmates without serious mental illness. GAO also interviewed officials from BOP and the selected states' corrections departments. What GAO Found About two-thirds of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inmates with a serious mental illness were incarcerated for four types of offenses\u2014drug offenses (23 percent), sex offenses (18 percent), weapons and explosives offenses (17 percent), and robbery (8 percent). The most common types of crimes committed by inmates with serious mental illness varied from state to state. The difference in types of crimes reported by states and BOP may be due to different priorities, laws, and enforcement priorities across the state and federal criminal justice systems, among other things. The federal and state governments also define serious mental illness differently, and they track different categories of crime in their respective data systems. BOP tracks the costs associated with incarcerating its overall inmate population and with providing mental health care services to inmates system-wide and separately by institution. For fiscal year 2016, BOP's institution-level data show that total incarceration costs vary by BOP institution (ranging from $15 million to over $247 million), for a number of reasons, including varying amounts of medical and mental health care available at each institution. BOP tracks the costs associated with incarcerating its overall inmate population and with providing mental health care services to inmates system-wide and separately by institution. For fiscal year 2016, BOP's institution-level data show that total incarceration costs vary by BOP institution (ranging from $15 million to over $247 million), for a number of reasons, including varying amounts of medical and mental health care available at each institution. BOP and selected states' departments of corrections provided GAO with estimates for different types of mental health care costs, but did not identify mental health care costs specifically for inmates with serious mental illness. Additionally, the states did not provide GAO with the total cost to incarcerate inmates with serious mental illness. To identify strategies to reduce recidivism among offenders with mental illness during incarceration and reentry, GAO searched for studies that analyzed the relationship between programs and recidivism among offenders with mental illness. GAO ultimately identified 14 studies that (1) assessed correctional institution or reentry programs for offenders with mental illness implemented in the United States, (2) contained quantitative analyses of the effect of a program on recidivism, and (3) used sufficiently sound methodologies for conducting such analyses. The studies examined different kinds of recidivism outcomes (e.g., re- arrest, re-incarceration, reconviction) and one study often examined more than one recidivism outcome. GAO categorizes the findings for each study as follows: Statistically significant reduction in recidivism: the study reported that one or more outcome measures indicated a statistically significant reduction in recidivism among program participants; the study may also have one or more recidivism outcome measures that were not statistically significant; Statistically significant increase in recidivism: the study reported that one or more outcome measures indicated a statistically significant increase in recidivism among program participants; the study may also have one or more recidivism outcome measures that were not statistically significant; and no statistically significant effect on recidivism: the study reported only outcomes indicating no statistically significant effect on recidivism among program participants. The results of the literature review provide insights into factors that can affect recidivism among individuals with mental illness; however, the following considerations should be taken into account: (1) the type of mental illness of program participants varied within and across programs making it difficult to generalize results to individuals with all types of mental illness; (2) the studies",
    "gao_GAO-19-189": "Why GAO Did This Study JWST is a NASA-funded project to replace the aging Hubble Space Telescope. JWST is to be launched in October 2018. The project is a complex undertaking that includes integrating and testing the observatory, integrating and testing the spacecraft element, and integrating and testing the spacecraft element. The project has experienced significant schedule delays and cost growth. GAO was asked to review the JWST project. This report examines (1) the project's history of cost growth and schedule delays, (2) the project's progress in executing its new schedule, and (3) the extent to which NASA has taken steps to oversee the contractor and project performance. GAO reviewed the project's history of cost growth and schedule delays, reviewed the project's cost and schedule estimates, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. What GAO Found The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program has a history of significant schedule delays and increases to project costs, which resulted in replans in 2011 and 2018. Before 2011, early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low levels of cost reserves, and poorly phased funding caused the JWST program to delay work. As a result, the program experienced schedule overruns, including launch delays, and cost growth. In 2011, the JWST program underwent a replan, which included a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion, which included additional money for operations and a planned launch in October 2018. In June 2018, after a series of launch delay announcements due to technical and workmanship issues identified during spacecraft element integration, NASA notified Congress that it had again revised the JWST program's cost and schedule estimates. NASA estimated that it now required $828 million in additional resources and 29 more months to complete beyond those estimates agreed to in the 2011 rebaseline. As of November 2018, NASA had funding to continue to execute the program and was waiting to see if Congress would authorize the program's continuation and appropriate funds for the program in fiscal year 2019. To develop a new schedule for JWST's 2018 replan, NASA took into account the remaining integration and test work and added time to the schedule to address threats that were not yet mitigated. This includes 5.5 months to address an anomaly that occurred on the sunshield's cover in 2018. The project also replenished its schedule reserves\u2014which GAO found in February 2018 had been consumed\u2014so that they now exceed the recommended levels. Both the project and the Independent Review Board (IRB) conducted schedule risk assessments that produced similar launch dates. The project relied on the replan schedule to determine its remaining costs because the workforce necessary to complete the observatory represents most of the remaining cost. The project's ability to execute to its new schedule will be tested as it progresses through the remainder of challenging integration and test work. The project has yet to complete three of five integration and test phases. The remaining phases include integration and test of the spacecraft element, the spacecraft element, and the observatory. GAO's prior work has shown that integration and testing is the phase in which problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip. For a uniquely complex project such as JWST, this risk is magnified as events start to become more sequential in nature. As a result, it will continue to become more difficult for the project to avoid schedule delays by mitigating issues in parallel. Conducting a Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) at system integration review would provide NASA and Congress with critical information for making informed resource decisions on the JWST project and its affordability within NASA's portfolio of projects more broadly. NASA has taken steps to augment oversight of the contractor and project following the discovery of embedded design flaws and workmanship errors that contributed to the project's most recent schedule delays and cost increases. For example, the project has taken steps to improve its quality assurance processes. For example, in July 2018, the project initiated a JWST mission assurance culture change campaign to increase focus on product quality and process compliance. The project has had recurring issues with effective internal and external communication as well as defining key management and oversight responsibilities, both of which are important to sustaining oversight. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the NASA Administrator direct the JWST project office to conduct a JCL prior to its system integration review. NASA agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-653": "Why GAO Did This Study The CSCP is a federal program to replace embassies that are at risk of terrorist attack. The CSCP is administered by the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), which in April 2018 had about 1,135 direct-hire civil service personnel, U.S. Foreign Service officers, and personal services contractors stationed in Washington, D.C., and overseas. The CSCP is intended to accelerate the replacement of embassies by constructing 150 new embassies by 2018. GAO was asked to review the CSCP. This report examines (1) the pace of the CSCP in constructing new embassies, (2) the cost and schedule performance of State's recent embassy construction projects, and (3) factors that have affected State's ability to deliver construction projects efficiently. GAO reviewed State's CSCP funding data from fiscal years 1999 through 2017, analyzed project completion data for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, and interviewed State officials. What GAO Found The Department of State's (State) Capital Security Construction Program (CSCP) has fallen short of its 2005 target of constructing 150 new embassies by 2018. This is due, in part, to unexpected building requirements and the effects of inflation. In 2012, recognizing the erosion of purchasing power as a result of inflation, the Benghazi Accountability Review Board recommended State work with Congress to increase the CSCP's annual funding level from $1.4 billion to approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2015 and for up to 10 years thereafter. OBO plans to begin construction of 25 embassies in fiscal years 2018-2022 and nearly 50 more beyond fiscal year 2022, but it is unclear whether OBO can maintain its average pace of 5 new embassy contract awards per year\u2014particularly as State has not defined the overall capital cost and potential timeframes needed to achieve this goal, nor does it currently expect to seek year-to-year adjustments for inflation. State's CSCP schedule for fiscal year 2017 identifies nearly 75 embassies still requiring replacement, but the overall capital cost and likely time frame expected to achieve the program's goal are unknown, as OBO has not made such estimates. State's one strategic CSCP-related performance indicator\u2014the relocation of staff into more secure and functional facilities\u2014provides no performance assessment on the extent to which Excellence facilities are any more functional, sustainable, or effective in supporting U.S. diplomacy. GAO recommended State determine whether this measure is still appropriate or needs to be revised. According to OBO officials, this metric is being revisited as part of a broader evaluation of OBO's performance measures. While cost growth occurred on a majority of completed embassy projects and durations averaged about 36 months, these were generally within budgeting and planning allowances. GAO could not assess cost and schedule performance of projects begun under the Excellence approach because none had been completed by 2017. OBO maintains that the greater upfront investment in more customized designs under this approach will yield long-term benefits in embassies' functionality, quality, and operating costs, as well as in their appearance in representing the United States. While an assessment of those potential benefits cannot be made at this time, GAO did find examples of Excellence and Excellence-like projects illustrating how innovative designs can increase upfront project costs. Staffing workload and contractor collaboration challenges impede efficiency of project delivery. OBO officials said some construction contractors selected to build new embassies have struggled to deliver projects, in part because they had less experience in terms of the number of embassies they had built or were new to the embassy program. Contractors have to learn a great deal of information very quickly\u2014to include State security standards, design specifications, and operating procedures\u2014and many do not succeed. Of the six contractors involved with GAO's nine project case studies, four of the five that GAO spoke with relayed concerns about poor working relationships with some OBO on-site Project Directors (PD) and that OBO was a difficult business partner, similar to concerns raised about OBO that GAO has previously reported. Formal construction partnering (partnering) is a recognized construction industry best practice to foster improved collaboration and problem solving and continues to be utilized by major federal construction agencies. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State (1) determine the estimated effects of cost inflation on planned CSCP embassy construction capacity and time frames and (2) ensure that the Director of OBO conducts an OBO-wide workforce analysis to assess staffing levels and workload capacity needed to support the CSCP. State concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-296": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. cattle industry is an important part of the nation's agricultural sector and contributes tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy. GAO was asked to review the U.S. cattle market. This report (1) describes key factors that affected fed cattle price changes from 2013 through 2016; (2) describes what CFTC found about possible trading irregularities in the futures market for fed cattle in 2015 and any changes to the futures contract for fed cattle since 2015; and (3) examines factors that may affect USDA's routine monitoring to ensure against discriminatory or anticompetitive practices in the fed cattle market. GAO analyzed USDA data on cattle transactions, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed USDA and CFTC officials. What GAO Found GAO's review identified several supply and demand factors\u2014such as a prolonged drought that affected the price of cattle feed and the availability of relatively less expensive protein substitutes such as pork\u2014that affected changes in fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2016. These factors included drought, costs for feed, and the price of substitute proteins, such as pork. For example, the price of corn decreased from about $6.87 per bushel in late 2012 to about $3.50 per bushel in late 2014. According to some experts and stakeholders, these heavier weights, combined with the larger overall number of cattle offered for sale in 2015, resulted in increased supply, exacerbating the price decline. Reduced demand for wholesale beef and for fed cattle also affected the large national changes in fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2016. Competition levels among packers varied in different areas of the country. These variations did not appear to explain the large national changes in fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2015 but may have contributed to variations in fed cattle prices in different areas of the country. CFTC's monitoring and analysis of trading patterns, including of particularly volatile trading days, did not find evidence of irregularities in the futures market for fed cattle in 2015. However, CFTC and others have expressed concern that certain terms in futures contracts for fed cattle\u2014such as the quality of beef represented in the contract\u2014did not sufficiently mirror the specifics of the fed cattle market, which could make them less useful to cattle market participants for hedging risk. In response, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange submitted changes to contract terms to CFTC. CFTC reviewed those changes, and where the agency found the changes consistent with the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations, allowed or expressly approved those changes. Two factors affect USDA's routine monitoring to ensure against discriminatory or anticompetitive practices in the fed cattle market. First, USDA's view of its legal authority does not allow P&SP routine access to the data from the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) price reporting group on daily transactions between packers and cattle feeders. Second, P&SP does not periodically analyze the transaction data that it collects from packers to learn more about the operation of the fed cattle market. As part of its monitoring program, P&SP reviews publicly available, summarized price data on a weekly basis but does not routinely review the data it collects on transactions between packers and feeders, a potentially useful source of data from packers that would enable P&SP to conduct more detailed monitoring. GAO conducted several in-depth analyses of P&SP's transaction data, and found that some of these analyses could provide useful information to agency management when it makes oversight decisions. For example, one of GAO's analyses found that different areas of the country experienced differing levels of competition and that, controlling for other possible sources of price variation, areas with less packer competition were associated with lower fed cattle prices. Such analyses may allow P&SP to better monitor changes in competition and prices over time, which may help inform its decisions on where to direct its investigative resources and better fulfill its mission to ensure against discriminatory or anticompetitive practices in the fed cattle market. By routinely conducting in-depth analysis of the transaction data it collects, USDA could enhance its monitoring of the fed cattle market. Such analysis could include but not be limited to examining competition levels in different areas of the country. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that USDA review the extent to which AMS's price reporting group can share daily transaction data with P&SP to strengthen the effectiveness of its oversight. USDA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-7": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States, China, and countries in Southeast Asia consume many types of illegally traded wildlife for diverse purposes. For example, elephant ivory is the world's largest consumer of illegally traded wildlife. In fiscal years 2014 through 2017, Congress directed that not less than certain specified amounts, totaling $271 million, be made available to combat wildlife trafficking. GAO was asked to review the demand for illegally traded wildlife in the United States and in Asia. This report examines (1) what is known about the demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products in the United States and in Asia, (2) actions agencies are taking to reduce demand for illegal wildlife products in the United States and Asia, and (3) the extent to which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior (DOI), the U.S. Department of State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are assessing the effectiveness of their combating wildlife trafficking (CWT) activities. GAO reviewed reports and surveys on demand for illegally traded wildlife and interviewed officials from U.S. government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and NGOs in the United States and in Asia. GAO also conducted fieldwork in Miami, Florida; China; Hong Kong; Thailand; and Vietnam. What GAO Found The United States, China, and countries in Southeast Asia consume many types of legal and illegal wildlife for diverse purposes. It is difficult to measure demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife products due to the illicit nature of the trade, but various data sources and reports provide examples of the range of wildlife demand by illustrating types of wildlife that are seized by governments and purchased by consumers. For example, from 2007 to 2016, more than one-third of the wildlife shipments seized by FWS were confiscated while being imported from or exported to Mexico (13.6 percent), China (13 percent), Canada (8.6 percent), and Mexico (13.6 percent). Demand for illegally traded wildlife in China and countries in Southeast Asia includes many wildlife species and end uses, according to reports and government and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) officials in the region. For example, iconic wildlife such as elephants and rhinos are often cited in reports and by officials in the field as examples of wildlife consumption in China and Southeast Asia, but other wildlife, such as pangolin scales and bear bile, are also named among the wildlife being consumed. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) within the Department of the Interior (DOI), the U.S. Department of State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are implementing demand reduction efforts, but opportunities exist to improve collaboration in Southeast Asia. FWS has led diplomacy efforts and implemented training and outreach programs in Southeast Asia and China. However, disagreement on roles and responsibilities has hindered some CWT activities in Southeast Asia. For example, FWS, State, and ICE HSI officials told GAO that they have collaborated on CWT activities in some instances. However, some officials reported instances of disagreement on roles and responsibilities that they said led to bad outcomes. For example, at the mission in Bangkok, Thailand, which coordinates CWT activities across the Southeast Asia region, agencies' disagreements on roles and responsibilities have resulted in the delivery of inappropriate training activities and interference with U.S. efforts to cooperate with a foreign government. FWS, State, and USAID have taken steps to assess CWT activities. For example, FWS has established standard indicators for CWT, such as the number of arrests of large-scale wildlife traffickers resulting from a project's investigations, operations support, or both; and the number of wildlife traffickers who have been arrested who are successfully prosecuted. FWS has also developed a strategic plan, a framework, and indicators to measure progress and success for CWT efforts. One USAID CWT program in Asia conducted a midterm evaluation, but State and FWS have not conducted any evaluations. FWS has established a new CWT-focused branch, which is developing a strategic plan, a framework, and indicators to measure progress and success for CWT efforts. In March 2016, the Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking released an annual progress report that describes U.S. government accomplishments; however, according to an official, the Task Force does not plan to issue a progress report in 2017 due to vacancies in leadership and because agencies are working on a similar report planned for completion sometime in 2017, in response to the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016.

    "gao_GAO-18-403": "Why GAO Did This Study Since 2012, demand for air travel has increased, and FAA projects that demand for commercial airline pilots will increase in the next 10 years. GAO was asked to review the challenges facing collegiate aviation schools. This report addresses (1) what is known about collegiate aviation schools with professional pilot degree programs in terms of location, types of training programs available, and enrollment; and (2) challenges that affect collegiate aviation schools' ability to produce professional pilots and schools' response to these challenges. GAO analyzed FAA data on collegiate aviation schools, interviewed representatives from a non-generalizable sample of schools, and reviewed documents and interviewed representatives from FAA, Education, and VA. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of schools and interviewed representatives from a non-generalizable sample of schools. What GAO Found Collegiate aviation schools are located across the country and offer different types of pilot degree programs. Collegiate aviation schools are public, private non-profit, and private for-profit. Almost all collegiate aviation schools are certificated by FAA under FAA's pilot school requirements. The remaining 101 collegiate aviation schools are certificated by FAA under FAA's pilot school requirements. FAA does not collect any enrollment data for these schools. FAA does not verify the data to determine their accuracy. FAA officials said that other data on collegiate aviation schools, such as enrollment numbers, do not serve FAA's primary safety purpose. FAA data on graduations from professional pilot programs are not comprehensive. Flight instructor turnover, cost of training, and other factors affect collegiate aviation schools' ability to produce professional pilots. Representatives from nearly all (16 of 18) of the schools identified recruiting and retaining flight instructors as a great or moderate challenge and a majority stated that it was their greatest challenge affecting their ability to produce pilots.

    "gao_GAO-18-353": "Why GAO Did This Study The KC-46 tanker is the Air Force's most expensive aircraft to operate. The program is a multibillion dollar effort to modernize the KC-135 tanker. The program is expected to produce 18 fully capable aircraft by October 2018. The Department of Defense (DOD) awarded a fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract to Boeing in August 2016. The contract specifies a ceiling price of $4.9 billion for Boeing to develop the first 4 aircraft, at which point Boeing must assume responsibility for all additional costs. GAO was asked to review the KC-46 program. This report examines (1) the cost estimates and performance goals for the KC-46 program and (2) the potential impact of KC-46 development problems on refueling capacity. GAO analyzed the KC-46 program's cost estimates and performance goals, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed program officials. What GAO Found The KC-46 program's total acquisition cost estimate remained stable over the past year at $44.4 billion, which is about $7.3 billion less than the original estimate. In addition, the aircraft is projected to meet all performance capabilities. However, Boeing is currently trying to resolve a critical deficiency it discovered during testing, which could affect performance. Boeing schedule documents indicate that the company remains committed to delivering 18 fully capable aircraft by October 2018, a program office risk assessment, as well as GAO's own analysis, project that Boeing will not deliver the aircraft until around May 2019, if risks are not mitigated. Boeing is taking steps to address several risks associated with developmental testing, but challenges remain. Boeing, not the government, is responsible for the cost of development delays based on the terms of the fixed-price contract. KC-46 development problems have resulted in delivery delays and kept the Air Force from achieving a higher level of refueling capacity it expected to achieve by this time. These problems have not resulted in additional costs to the government. However, if delivery delays continue past October 2018, the Air Force will need to maintain legacy aircraft such as the KC-135 longer than planned. The cost of maintaining those KC-135 aircraft is estimated to be about $10.3 million per year per aircraft. Additionally, about $12 million per aircraft may also be needed, according to Air Force officials. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics closely monitor the cost, schedule, and performance outcomes of the KC-46 program to identify positive or negative lessons learned. DOD did not provide any written comments, but the KC-46 program office provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-117": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a long-standing interest in ensuring that individuals who have been determined to be eligible for access to classified information are vetted to ensure that they are eligible for access to classified information. Continuous evaluation is a vetting process to review the background of an individual who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position at any time during the period of eligibility. Continuous evaluation is intended to fill the gap between periodic reinvestigations in which issues relevant to an individual's continued eligibility for a security clearance may go unreported or unknown. GAO was asked to review the implementation of continuous evaluation. This report examines (1) the extent to which ODNI has implemented continuous evaluation across the executive branch, and (2) the extent to which executive branch agencies have met established timeliness goals for completing periodic reinvestigations and the potential effects of continuous evaluation on periodic reinvestigations and agency resources. GAO reviewed ODNI documents and interviewed ODNI officials and officials from seven executive branch agencies. What GAO Found The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has taken an initial step to implement continuous evaluation across the executive branch in a phased approach, but as of May 2017, it had not yet formalized the program in policy. ODNI initiated the first phase of continuous evaluation and outlined requirements for this phase in interim guidance distributed to implementing agencies in December 2016. For the first phase of implementation, executive branch agencies are to conduct certain continuous evaluation record checks against a portion of their national security population. Specific details of the requirements were omitted from this report because the information is sensitive. ODNI has not yet determined key aspects of the program, including future phases of implementation and agency requirements. Moreover, the timeframes for the implementation of continuous evaluation across the executive branch have been extended over time. For example, the original milestone set by the government-wide reform effort for implementing continuous evaluation was the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2010, and it was not attained. The PAC subsequently set an Insider Threat and Security Clearance Reform cross-agency priority goal milestone for developing an initial continuous evaluation capability for the most sensitive top secret clearance holders by September 2014\u2014which was extended to December 2014\u2014and a milestone for implementing the capability for additional clearance holders by December 2016. These milestones were also missed. As of May 2017, continuous evaluation had not yet been fully implemented, and ODNI had not set a milestone for when it would occur. ODNI officials stated that they have not set any further timeframes for implementing continuous evaluation or determined agency requirements for future phases. Moreover, the timeframes for the implementation of continuous evaluation across the executive branch have been extended over time. For example, the original milestone set by the government-wide reform effort for implementing continuous evaluation was the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2010, and it was not attained.

These milestones were also missed. As of May 2017, continuous evaluation had not yet been fully implemented, and ODNI had not set a milestone for when it would occur.

ODNI officials stated that they have not developed a plan to monitor or assess the performance of continuous evaluation across the executive branch, including for the first phase of implementation, which is underway. ODNI officials stated that they have not developed\u2014or distributed to executive branch agencies conducting continuous evaluation\u2014any performance measures for continuous evaluation. Without developing clear, quantifiable, and objective performance measures that are linked to measurable goals for agencies to track, and without determining a process and schedule for agencies to regularly report those measures, ODNI cannot ensure that the first phase of the program it has already initiated is effective or achieving similar results at all agencies, which could ultimately affect reciprocity. The number of executive branch agencies meeting established timeliness goals for completing periodic reinvestigations decreased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The executive branch has not assessed the potential effects of continuous evaluation on periodic reinvestigations and agency resources. For example, the executive branch has not assessed the potential effects of continuous evaluation on the frequency or scope of periodic reinvestigations, and agencies have varying views about what, if any, additional changes should be made to the personnel security clearance process.

    "gao_GAO-18-450": "Why GAO Did This Study The PAIMI Act requires state PAIMI programs to investigate reports of potential abuse and neglect of individuals with significant mental illness. The act also requires GAO to review the effectiveness of these programs. This report examines (1) the outcomes of selected state PAIMI programs in preventing and preventing abuse, neglect, and rights violations of individuals with significant mental illness; (2) the extent to which SAMHSA oversees program compliance with PAIMI requirements; and (3) the extent to which SAMHSA has procedures to ensure program effectiveness. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents; analyzed program performance reports; and interviewed SAMHSA officials. What GAO Found The eight selected state Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) programs reported favorably resolving a majority of individuals' cases related to alleged abuse, neglect, or rights violations in fiscal year 2016. In addition, these selected programs reported concluding a variety of systemic activities, with a significant focus on monitoring and addressing issues of abuse or neglect at facilities. Through their work with individuals and completion of systemic activities, the selected programs reported meeting a majority of their priority goals and objectives. SAMHSA has controls in place for monitoring the PAIMI programs' compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, but oversight of program effectiveness is more limited. SAMHSA has procedures in place to monitor program compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements through its ongoing and periodic in-depth monitoring activities. GAO found evidence that SAMHSA had identified and resolved a variety of compliance issues through these activities. For example, SAMHSA followed up with one program in which the advisory council had failed to meet the threshold of 60 percent of its membership being individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services, or are family members of such individuals. Failing to meet this threshold could raise concerns about whether a program is sufficiently engaging individuals and family members affected by mental illness as required by regulation. In addition, SAMHSA has procedures to oversee state PAIMI program compliance during its periodic onsite monitoring reviews. GAO identified two weaknesses that could be limiting SAMHSA's oversight of program effectiveness. First, SAMHSA's PAIMI program monitoring did not consistently record changes to program priority goals, objectives, and targets\u2014collectively, \u201cbenchmarks\u201d\u2014made during a performance year, and the agency did not have procedures for examining such changes over time. Second, the agency did not provide timely information to programs on identified deficiencies from onsite monitoring. As of March 2018, SAMHSA was in the process of implementing new processes for its oversight of state PAIMI programs that officials believe will streamline the agency's monitoring activities. However, these changes may not fully address the weaknesses GAO identified. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that SAMHSA establish procedures to better ensure that mid-performance changes to program priority goals, objectives, and targets are examined across multiple years. SAMHSA concurred with both recommendations and indicated that it will examine ways to implement them.",

This statement is based on GAO's September 2011 report, which examined HRSA's oversight of the 340B Program and the extent to which HRSA has implemented GAO's September 2011 recommendation to clarify program guidance. GAO reviewed HRSA's guidance and interviewed HRSA officials. What GAO Found The Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) oversight of the 340B Program was weak because it primarily relied on covered entities and manufacturers to police themselves and ensure their own compliance with program requirements. Upon enrollment into the program, HRSA requires participants to self-certify that they will comply with applicable 340B Program requirements and any accompanying agency guidance, and expects participants to develop the procedures necessary to ensure and document compliance, informing HRSA if violations occur. HRSA officials told GAO that covered entities and manufacturers could also monitor each other's compliance with program requirements, but GAO found that, in practice, participants could face limitations to such an approach. Beyond relying on participants' self-policing, GAO also found that HRSA engaged in few activities to oversee the 340B Program and ensure its integrity, which agency officials said was primarily due to funding constraints. In response to GAO's September 2011 report, HRSA implemented a systematic approach to conducting annual audits of covered entities that is outlined on its website. HRSA currently audits a total of 200 entities per year, which accounts for less than 2 percent of covered entities. As a result of the audits already conducted, HRSA has identified instances of non-compliance with program requirements, including violations related to drug diversion and the potential for duplicate discounts. In its September 2011 report, GAO found that HRSA's guidance on three key program requirements lacked the necessary level of specificity to provide clear direction, making it difficult for participants to self-police or monitor others' compliance, and raising concerns that the guidance could be interpreted in ways that were inconsistent with its intent. For example, GAO found that HRSA's guidance on the definition of an eligible patient lacked the necessary specificity to clearly define the various situations under which an individual was considered eligible for discounted drugs through the 340B Program. As a result, covered entities could interpret the definition either too broadly or too narrowly. HRSA had not issued guidance specifying the criteria under which hospitals that were not publicly owned or operated could qualify for the 340B Program. For example, GAO found that HRSA guidance lacking on one of the ways hospitals could qualify for the program, namely by executing a contract with a state or local government to provide services to low-income individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. Specifically, GAO found that HRSA did not outline any criteria that must be included in such contracts, such as the amount of care a hospital must provide to these low-income individuals, and did not require the hospitals to submit their contracts for review by HRSA. As a result, hospitals with contracts that provided a small amount of care to low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare could claim 340B discounts, which may not have been what the agency intended. Given the lack of specificity in these areas, GAO recommended that HRSA (1) finalize new, more specific guidance on the definition of an eligible patient, and (2) issue guidance to further specify the criteria that hospitals not publicly owned or operated must meet to be eligible for the 340B Program. HRSA agreed with these recommendations and had planned to address them in a comprehensive 340B Program regulation that it submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in April 2014. However, in November 2014 following a May 2014 federal district court ruling that the agency had not been granted broad rulemaking authority to carry out all the provisions of the 340B Program, the agency issued a proposed Omnibus Guidance in August 2015 to interpret statutory requirements for the 340B Program in areas where it did not have explicit rulemaking authority, including further specificity on the definition of a patient of a covered entity and hospital eligibility for 340B Program participation. However, in January 2017, the agency withdrew the guidance following the administration",
    "gao_GAO-18-499": "Why GAO Did This Study U.S. agencies implement foreign assistance programs under the auspices of government-wide strategies. GAO has previously reported that strategies that consider relationships among goals and objectives, interagency collaboration, and performance assessment can improve federal management. GAO was asked to review the extent to which foreign assistance strategies address key elements related to alignment of agencies' efforts. This report examines the extent to which foreign assistance strategies address key elements that GAO identified related to (1) interagency coordination, (2) strategic integration, and (3) assessment of progress toward strategic goals. GAO reviewed 52 foreign assistance strategies that were in effect during 2017. GAO also interviewed agency officials and reviewed agency guidance. What GAO Found Many of the 52 foreign assistance strategies that GAO reviewed at least partially addressed the key elements GAO identified related to alignment of foreign assistance strategies, but some did not address these elements. For example, 40 percent of the strategies generally identified roles and responsibilities for implementing the strategies, while 33 percent generally identified interagency coordination mechanisms; 23 percent and 38 percent, respectively, did not address these elements. Regarding strategic integration, 58 percent of the strategies described linkages with U.S. foreign assistance strategies in the same sector and 54 percent generally described linkages with relevant higher- or lower-level U.S. foreign assistance strategies; 21 percent and 25 percent, respectively, did not identify such linkages. Regarding assessment of progress toward strategic goals, almost all of the strategies generally established desired results and a framework of goals and objectives and described activities to achieve results; however, 21 percent did not identify milestones or performance indicators and 21 percent did not outline plans for monitoring and evaluation. GAO also found that the six agencies implementing most U.S. foreign assistance do not have consistent guidance for strategy development that could help ensure their strategies address the key elements GAO identified. For example, State and USAID guidance for strategy development includes many of these elements but does not cover all strategies that these agencies are involved in developing. Additionally, guidance for State's and USAID's joint regional strategies, State's functional bureau strategies, and USAID's country development cooperation strategies does not apply to other State and USAID strategies, such as the joint State-USAID integrated country strategies. DOD has also established guidance for developing security assistance programs that addresses the key elements GAO identified. However, DOD's guidance does not explicitly apply to the development of foreign assistance strategies. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of State ensure that the Director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources leads an effort to establish, in collaboration with the five other agencies that implement most of U.S. foreign assistance, guidance for strategy development that addresses the key elements GAO identified related to interagency coordination, strategic integration, and assessment of progress toward strategic goals. State and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-19-158": "Why GAO Did This Study The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires CFPB to monitor for certain risks to consumers in support of its rulemaking and other agency functions. The act also requires CFPB to issue at least one report annually of significant findings from its risk monitoring. The act also requires GAO to review CFPB's efforts to assess the impact of its rules. This report examines (1) how CFPB monitors consumer financial markets and how it prioritizes risks to consumers, and (2) the extent to which CFPB has taken steps to meet the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to retrospectively assess significant rules. GAO reviewed CFPB's market-monitoring efforts, analyzed CFPB's rulemaking and supervisory priorities, and interviewed CFPB officials. What GAO Found The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) monitors consumer financial markets through a variety of methods. It also conducts more targeted market monitoring to support rulemaking and other agency functions. CFPB collects and monitors routine market data and other market intelligence through a combination of internal and external data sources and outreach. CFPB also conducts targeted research and data collection to inform rulemaking efforts, meet statutory reporting requirements, and learn more about a particular market for consumer financial products. CFPB currently lacks a systematic, bureau-wide process for prioritizing financial risks facing consumers\u2014using information from its market monitoring, among other sources\u2014and for considering how it will use its tools to address those risks. In 2015, CFPB initiated such a process, but CFPB officials said that the most recent round of this process was completed in 2017 and that its leadership has not yet decided whether to continue using the process. In a February 2016 public report, CFPB described this process (which CFPB refers to internally as \u201cOne Bureau\u201d) for deploying shared bureau-wide resources to address some of the most troubling problems facing consumers. Through this One Bureau process, CFPB prioritized problems that pose risks to consumers based on the extent of the consumer harm CFPB had identified and its capacity to eliminate or mitigate that harm. The bureau revisited its stated priorities in June 2017 to guide its work through fiscal year 2018. However, officials said that while the working groups continue to facilitate communication, informal collaboration, and strategy-setting across the bureau, CFPB has not decided whether to engage in a third round of prioritization under the One Bureau process. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve agency objectives, such as by using quality information to make informed decisions. In addition, the standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. CFPB has taken steps to meet the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to retrospectively assess significant rules or orders and issue reports of such assessments within 5 years of the rule's effective date. CFPB officials said that the bureau may modify the process for future work after it has completed its first three assessments. The assessments will be in addition to other regulatory reviews conducted by CFPB. For each of the three rules it determined to be significant, CFPB created detailed assessment plans and a timeline for completion. Each plan defined which aspects of the rules the assessment would focus on; outlined the scope and methodology, including challenges for the assessment and potential limitations of methodology; and identified data CFPB planned to gather and compile, including CFPB's own and third-party data, and explained how the data will be used to evaluate the effects of the rule. CFPB issued requests for information between March and June of 2017 to collect public input on each assessment and created plans for incorporating the comments in each assessment report. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, these requests solicited comments on modifying, expanding, or eliminating the rules. In addition, CFPB requested comments on the assessment plans and invited suggestions on other data that might be useful for evaluating the rules' effects. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CFPB implement a systematic process for prioritizing risks to consumers and considering how to use the bureau's available policy tools\u2014such as rulemaking, supervision, enforcement, and consumer education\u2014to address these risks. CFPB did not agree or disagree with GAO's recommendation but stated that it will endeavor to improve its processes for identifying and addressing consumer financial risks.",
    "gao_GAO-18-462": "Why GAO Did This Study The Capital Investment Grants program, a discretionary and competitive grant program funded through annual appropriations, provides funding to local transit agencies to improve the capacity of their transit systems. The program is governed by statutory provisions, and funding is provided in the form of a construction grant agreement, which is subject to congressional appropriations. The program is designed and implemented by project sponsors, which are usually local transit agencies. In 2012, Congress created a third category of eligible projects called Core Capacity projects. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines (1) the extent to which FTA has addressed the outstanding provisions of the program, and (2) the extent to which FTA has established a process to verify that proposed Core Capacity projects meet statutory requirements before recommending projects for funding. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed FTA officials and six project sponsors. GAO also reviewed documentation supporting FTA's funding recommendations for the two Core Capacity projects with grant agreements as of June 2017, and interviewed FTA officials and representatives from the six project sponsors. What GAO Found The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has not addressed three of four outstanding statutory provisions concerning the Capital Investment Grants program. Three of these provisions stem from the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) and the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) Federal Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), enacted in 2015. When GAO initiated its review, FTA officials told GAO FTA did not have immediate plans to address the outstanding statutory provisions due to the administration's stated intent to phase out the program. FTA's annual reports to Congress, which contain funding recommendations for the program, have reflected this direction. For example, FTA's Fiscal Year 2018 report recommended that Congress only fund those projects that had already received a grant agreement through the program, and FTA's Fiscal Year 2019 report stated that FTA neither requests nor recommends any funding for projects in the Capital Investment Grants program beyond those that have already received a grant agreement. However, in March 2018 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, provided the program with more than $2.6 billion, and also directed FTA to continue to administer the program in accordance with the program's procedural and substantive requirements. Following the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, FTA officials told GAO that they are reviewing the law and determining next steps. However, they did not indicate that they have any immediate plans to address those provisions. Until FTA takes steps to address the outstanding provisions, FTA runs the risk of violating federal law. During GAO's review, FTA officials noted that other factors have also influenced FTA's decisions. For example, FTA officials noted that since GAO's last report, issuing regulations regarding the evaluation and rating process for Core Capacity projects was not identified as one of the Department's regulatory priorities and, currently, FTA has no plans to issue such regulations. However, issuing regulations to address this provision is important. FTA officials stated that FTA has not initiated rulemaking to address this provision. Until FTA initiates rulemaking, it is unclear when if at all, FTA might address most of these outstanding provisions. Taking steps to describe the steps project sponsors should follow to apply for consideration as a pilot project under the Expedited Project Delivery for Capital Investment Grants Pilot Program could help FTA better understand whether further changes are needed. FTA has established a process to verify that proposed Core Capacity projects meet statutory requirements before recommending projects for funding. Specifically, based on GAO's review of documentation supporting FTA's funding recommendations for the two Core Capacity projects with grant agreements as of June 2017, as well as interviews with FTA officials and both project sponsors, GAO found that FTA took steps to verify that the statutory requirements were met before recommending those two projects for full funding grant agreements. Representatives of the other four sponsors GAO spoke with also confirmed that FTA is taking steps to verify that their projects meet the statutory requirements. Such requirements include specific project eligibility and other requirements that projects must meet during the Project Development and Engineering phases of the development process. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FTA take steps to (1) initiate a rulemaking regarding the evaluation and rating process for Core Capacity Improvement projects, consistent with statutory provisions; (2) take steps to describe the process project sponsors should follow to apply for consideration as a pilot project under the Expedited Project Delivery for Capital Investment Grants Pilot Program; and (3) describe the process project sponsors should follow to apply for consideration as a pilot project under",
    "gao_GAO-19-225T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Navy and Marine Corps have experienced significant readiness challenges in recent years. The Navy and Marine Corps have made encouraging progress identifying the causes of their readiness decline and have begun efforts to arrest and reverse it; however, GAO's prior work shows that fully addressing the persistent readiness challenges will require years of sustained management attention. This testimony addresses (1) the challenges the Navy and Marine Corps face in rebuilding readiness and the costs associated with expanding the fleet to enhance readiness in the future, and (2) the challenges the Navy and Marine Corps face in sustaining readiness and the challenges the F-35 program faces. This statement is based on GAO's prior work and updated information from the Navy and Marine Corps in November 2018. What GAO Found The Navy and Marine Corps face significant readiness challenges as they seek to rebuild the readiness of their forces. GAO has reported that the Navy has taken steps to provide dedicated training time so its surface forces may meet existing Navy training standards and their training is certified when they deploy. However, the Navy continues to struggle with rebuilding the readiness of the existing fleet due to enduring maintenance and manning challenges. As the Navy seeks to expand its fleet by 25 percent, these challenges will likely be further exacerbated and the Navy will likely face additional affordability challenges. GAO's work has shown that Navy and Marine Corps aircraft availability has been limited by aging aircraft, delayed maintenance, and insufficient supply support. Pilot and maintenance personnel shortfalls further limit readiness recovery across legacy air platforms. The growing F-35 program, which is meant to replace many aging aircraft, has presented additional operational and sustainment challenges, which will likely persist into the future if not corrected. DOD, the Navy, and the Marine Corps have emphasized mission capability of critical aviation platforms\u2014including the Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18s and F-35s\u2014and are taking steps to improve availability, but these efforts will take time to realize results. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to the Navy and Marine Corps to address readiness challenges and to improve the F-35 program. DOD concurred with most of the recommendations and has many actions underway. However, DOD has not fully implemented any of the recommendations to date.",
    "gao_GAO-18-268": "Why GAO Did This Study CBP is responsible for ensuring that the nation's ports of entry (POE) are operating efficiently and effectively. In 2013, CBP established the RSP to cover CBP's costs of providing certain services at POEs upon the request of partners. The DAP allows CBP to accept donations from private and public sector entities, such as seaports or land border crossings, to provide new or additional services upon the request of partners. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the DAP. This report examines (1) how CBP evaluates and administers its public-private partnership programs, and (2) the extent to which CBP monitors and evaluates the implementation and benefits of its public-private partnership programs. GAO reviewed CBP's application process, DAP application process, and DAP agreements; analyzed CBP data on the number of RSP agreements and DAP agreements; and interviewed CBP and partner officials. What GAO Found U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses criteria and documented procedures to evaluate and approve public-private partnership applications and administer programs. CBP has developed detailed guidance on the application process, including application timeframes, requirements, and evaluation criteria. CBP also uses criteria and documented processes to evaluate DAP proposals and implement the program. For example, CBP and the General Services Administration (GSA) developed the Section 482 Donation Acceptance Authority Proposal Evaluation Procedures & Criteria Framework (Framework) for receiving, evaluating, approving, planning, developing, and formally accepting donations under the program. CBP and its partners have flexibility to tailor RSP implementation based on local conditions or needs. For example, CBP's partner at Miami International Airport in Florida relies on CBP to schedule RSP overtime daily based on CBP expertise. CBP and its partners also noted some challenges to implementing RSP and DAP agreements, but partners generally agreed that the program benefits outweighed the challenges. For example, some DAP partners GAO met with mentioned that navigating GSA requirements was difficult and sometimes caused delays. CBP and its partners also noted some challenges to implementing RSP and DAP agreements, but partners generally agreed that the program benefits outweighed the challenges. For example, some DAP partners GAO met with mentioned that navigating GSA requirements was difficult and sometimes caused delays. CBP and its partners also acknowledged a lack of clarity about which entity or entities are responsible for the long-term operations and maintenance costs of DAP infrastructure projects, although CBP has taken steps to address this issue. CBP uses various processes to monitor and evaluate its public-private partnership programs, but could benefit from establishing an evaluation plan to assess overall program performance. CBP uses various processes to monitor and evaluate the implementation and benefits of its public-private partnership programs, but could benefit from establishing an evaluation plan to assess overall program performance. For example, CBP conducts regular audits using information from its Service Request Portal, its overtime management system, and its internal accounting system to ensure partners appropriately reimburse CBP for the overtime services that it provides under the RSP. CBP also monitors overall DAP implementation by collecting quantitative data on the efficiency of DAP processes to inform program and process improvements. For example, from 2015 to 2016, CBP consolidated certain elements of its application evaluation process to reduce the number of days it takes to evaluate and approve applications from an average of 144 days to 75 days for large-scale donations. In addition, CBP works with its partners to develop a plan for identifying, measuring, and reporting on the local benefits to be derived from accepted donations upon project completion. CBP is taking steps to monitor the existing use and impacts of its public-private partnership programs and to plan for further expansion of these programs. For example, CBP is hiring new staff members and contractors for the AFP office, as well as reimbursing the Office of Finance for one staff position and embedding one staff member in the Budget Office to help complete the increased number of financial transactions and audits. In addition, the AFP office is considering the future impact of DAP projects on staffing and other resources at the affected POEs, and is working with Field Office, POE, and partner officials to identify and budget for anticipated operational needs, with assistance from CBP's Workload Staffing Model and Planning, Program Analysis and Evaluation offices. These efforts to monitor and evaluate the impacts of the programs and plan for further expansion are positive steps that should help position CBP to manage anticipated increases in the number of agreements going forward. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CBP develop and implement an evaluation plan to be used to assess the overall performance of the RSP and DAP, which could include, among other things, measurable objectives",
    "gao_GAO-18-590": "Why GAO Did This Study The NDAA established PLCY to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide policy development and implementation, and strategic planning. The NDAA also established PLCY to provide oversight of crosscutting strategic efforts. GAO was asked to review PLCY's efforts to coordinate policy development and implementation. This report examines (1) PLCY's effectiveness in coordinating policy development and implementation, and (2) PLCY's workforce planning. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed PLCY documents; and interviewed PLCY and DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Policy and Logistics Coordinating Office (PLCY) has effectively coordinated departmentwide and crosscutting strategy efforts, but ambiguous roles and responsibilities and a lack of predictable, accountable, and repeatable procedures have limited PLCY's ability to lead and coordinate policy development and implementation. PLCY has effectively carried out key coordination functions at the senior level related to strategy, but PLCY's ability to lead and coordinate policy have been limited due to ambiguous roles and responsibilities and a lack of predictable, accountable, and repeatable procedures. PLCY officials acknowledged that this practice does not always make them the lead and there are no established criteria that define the circumstances under which PLCY (or another organizational unit) should lead development of policies that cut across organizational boundaries. PLCY officials stated that, once components have been assigned responsibility for a policy, they have generally tended to retain it, and PLCY may not have oversight for crosscutting policies that are maintained by operational components. Therefore, there is no established, coordinated system of oversight to periodically monitor the need for policy harmonization, revision, or rescission. PLCY officials stated that past efforts to finalize a delegation of authority\u2014a mechanism by which the Secretary delegates responsibilities to other organizational units within DHS\u2014have stalled during leadership changes and that the initiative has been a lower priority, in part, due to where PLCY is in its maturation process and DHS is in its evolution into a more cohesive department under the Unity of Effort. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY determines its workforce needs through the annual budget process, but systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them could help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. PLCY officials said they conduct some workforce planning activities as part of its annual budgeting process, but do not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help predict workforce demand, and identify any workforce gaps and design strategies to address them. Without this analysis, PLCY faces limitations in ensuring that its workforce is aligned with its and DHS's priorities and goals. Moreover, the results of this analysis would better position PLCY to communicate to DHS leadership any potential tradeoffs in workforce allocation that would affect PLCY's ability to meet priorities and goals. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DHS finalize a delegation of authority or similar document that clearly defines PLCY's mission, roles, and responsibilities relative to DHS's operational and support components. DHS concurred with three of GAO's recommendations and described actions planned to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-179": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid spending on long-term care has increased from $146 billion in 2013 to $158 billion in 2015. In 2014, GAO reported that Medicaid beneficiaries receiving services in assisted living facilities were at risk for abuse, neglect, or exploitation. GAO was asked to review Medicaid beneficiary health and welfare. This report examines (1) the number of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving services in 2014, (2) the approaches states have for overseeing the health and welfare of beneficiaries in assisted living services, and (3) the extent to which CMS oversees the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries in assisted living and other community settings. GAO surveyed state Medicaid agencies in 48 states, analyzed CMS data on Medicaid beneficiary spending, and interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found Forty-eight states reported collectively spending about $10 billion in state and federal Medicaid funds for assisted living services in 2014, according to GAO's survey. The other 3 states reported that they did not pay for assisted living services. GAO estimates that this spending for services provided by assisted living facilities represents 12.4 percent of the $80.6 billion Medicaid spent on home- and community-based services (HCBS) in all settings that year. Forty-eight states reported covering assisted living services through 132 different programs. The majority of the states, 31 of the 48, reported administering more than one program that covered assisted living services. State Medicaid agency approaches for overseeing the health and welfare of beneficiaries in assisted living services varied widely, including monitoring incidents of beneficiary harm. Thirteen of the 48 state Medicaid agencies reported delegating administrative responsibilities, including oversight of beneficiary health and welfare, to other state or local agencies. State Medicaid agencies also varied in the types of information they reported reviewing as part of the oversight of assisted living services, and the extent to which state Medicaid agencies review the information when another agency is responsible for administration. For their largest HCBS programs that covered assisted living services, the 48 states varied in how they monitored \u201ccritical incidents\u201d that caused actual or potential harm to Medicaid beneficiaries in assisted living facilities. Specifically, the 48 states varied in their ability to report the number of critical incidents; how they defined incidents, and the extent to which they made information on such incidents readily available to the public. These states varied in whether they could provide GAO the number of critical incidents involving beneficiaries for their largest programs covering assisted living services, and for those that could report, the number of incidents they reported varied widely. In recent years, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken steps to improve oversight of the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries in HCBS programs by adding new HCBS waiver application requirements for state monitoring of beneficiary health and welfare. CMS requires state waiver applications to include specific requirements that implement various statutory and regulatory provisions, including a provision that states assure that they will safeguard the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries. In March 2014, CMS added unexplained death to the events that states must be able to identify and address on an ongoing basis, as part of their efforts to prevent instances of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. CMS added four new requirements for states to protect beneficiary health and welfare. However, GAO found a number of limitations in CMS's oversight of approved HCBS waivers that undermine the agency's ability to effectively monitor state oversight of HCBS waivers. These limitations include: unclear guidance on what states should identify and report annually related to any identified program deficiencies; lack of requirements on states to regularly provide CMS information on critical incidents; and inconsistent enforcement of the requirement that states submit annual reports. Without improvements to state reporting, CMS cannot ensure states are meeting their commitments to protect the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving assisted living services, potentially jeopardizing their care. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS clarify requirements regarding the monitoring and reporting of deficiencies that states using HCBS waivers are required to report on their annual reports; establish standard reporting requirements for all states to report on critical incidents; and ensure that all states submit annual reports for HCBS waivers on time as required. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-245": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2007\u20132009 financial crisis raised concerns about the risk of a rise in bank CRE concentrations. GAO was asked to review the extent to which banks with CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks. This report examines (1) trends in the CRE lending markets, including changes in the level of credit and concentration risk in the markets, and (2) actions federal banking regulators took through their examinations to help ensure that banks with CRE concentrations are effectively managing the related risks. GAO reviewed academic literature and prior GAO work and interviewed officials from the federal banking regulators and private data providers. GAO also developed and estimated several models of aggregate losses on bank CRE loans. GAO analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of 54 examinations conducted from 2013 through 2016 from 40 banks. GAO also interviewed officials from the regulators and private data providers. What GAO Found Although the commercial real estate (CRE) sector has recovered since the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis, GAO's trend and econometric analyses generally indicate that credit and other risks related to bank CRE lending have increased over the past several years. For example, spending on CRE construction projects\u2014a source of demand for bank financing\u2014has rebounded. Similarly, delinquency and charge-off rates on bank CRE loans have fallen from their post-crisis peaks and are at or below their lowest levels since 2002. Although these rates provide information on the current performance of bank CRE loans, they provide little or no information about potential future risks faced by banks. GAO's analysis of other market, underwriting, and lending data and forecasts from predictive econometric models suggest that credit risk has increased, though it remains lower than the level of risk associated with the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis. GAO found that federal banking regulators generally subjected banks with relatively high concentrations in CRE loans to greater supervisory scrutiny in comparison to banks with relatively lower concentrations in CRE loans in its review of 54 examinations for 40 banks conducted from 2013 through 2016. In all of these examinations, the regulators specifically assessed whether each bank had adequate risk management practices and capital for managing its CRE concentration risk and generally found that the banks had adequate risk management practices and capital. In a few examinations, regulators differed in how they addressed supervisory concerns about a bank's CRE-related risk management practices. For example, in a few examinations, GAO found differences across regulators in how they addressed supervisory concerns about banks' CRE-related risk management practices because of differences in the regulators' policies. For example, in 2 reports of examination, GAO found that Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) examiners did not find the banks' CRE-related risk management practices to be inadequate but included matters requiring immediate attention (MRA) to direct the banks to enhance or sustain certain CRE-related risk management practices. Similarly, in 1 report of examination, Federal Reserve examiners found that the bank's risk management practices and capital were adequate for its CRE concentrations but included an MRA to require the bank to enhance its capital plan to include concentration risk considerations. In addition, from 2013 through 2016, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took formal enforcement actions against banks for not adequately managing risks related to their CRE concentrations, including those outlined in the jointly issued 2006 CRE guidance. FDIC took 22 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their CRE concentrations during this period. The Federal Reserve took 2 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their risk management of CRE lending. OCC took 11 formal enforcement actions against banks for matters related to their CRE concentrations during this same period. The majority of these formal enforcement actions discussed the 2006 CRE guidance and directed the banks to improve their practices for managing their CRE concentration risk. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.",

FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain account information of their U.S. customers. FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain account information of their U.S. customers. GAO was asked to review FATCA implementation. This report examines (1) IRS's efforts to use FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) available foreign financial asset reports submitted by U.S. persons, including submissions that were below required filing thresholds; (3) the extent to which the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) administers overlapping reporting requirements on foreign financial assets; (4) similarities and differences between FATCA and Common Reporting Standard (CRS) reporting requirements; and (5) the effects of FATCA implementation that are unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed IRS and FinCEN documentation and interviewed IRS and FinCEN officials and representatives from five countries selected to represent a range of U.S. persons living abroad. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has limited efforts to improve taxpayer compliance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) by ensuring that taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets. IRS collects information on financial accounts through forms and reports submitted by both taxpayers and FFIs. As part of this effort, IRS requires taxpayers to identify their tax identification numbers (TIN) on Forms 8938 they submit. IRS also requires participating FFIs to report the TINs of each account holder who is a specified U.S. person on Forms 8966. IRS intends to use reported TINs to link Form 8938 data filed by taxpayers to Form 8966 data filed by the FFIs to ensure that taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets. However, IRS often could not link account information collected from FFIs to the account's owner because of incorrect or missing TINs. IRS officials said that IRS continues efforts to systematically match Form 8938 and Form 8966 data to identify nonfilers and underreporting related to U.S. holders of foreign accounts. However, IRS has stopped following its FATCA Compliance Roadmap it developed in 2016 because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. However, in light of the challenges IRS continues to face in fully integrating FATCA information into its compliance programs, it will not maximize use of such information and effectively leverage individual compliance campaigns unless it employs a comprehensive plan that enables IRS to better leverage such campaigns to improve taxpayer compliance. GAO's analysis of available data indicates that more than 900,000 individuals filed Forms 8938 in calendar years 2015 and 2016, and declared total maximum values of accounts ranging from about $1.5 trillion to more than $2 trillion each year. A little more than one in five\u2014or about 21.7 percent\u2014of the approximately 404,800 Forms 8938 filed with IRS in tax year 2016 were done so so from U.S. persons living abroad, with the other 78.3 percent living in the United States. IRS officials said they have not taken direct steps to identify or implement actions to further clarify instructions and related guidance on IRS's website for completing Form 8938, such as information on which foreign financial assets to report, how to calculate asset values, and determine whether such values exceed required reporting thresholds. IRS officials said they have not conducted additional outreach to educate taxpayers on required reporting thresholds under FATCA, or notify Form 8938 filers of instances where aggregate values of specified foreign financial assets reported on Forms 8938 were below reporting thresholds. IRS officials said they have not made efforts to determine whether there is a pattern of unnecessary Form 8938 filings that they could address. Rather, they said they believed resources should be devoted to FATCA implementation in general. However, GAO identified tens of thousands of instances where U.S. persons may have filed Forms 8938 unnecessarily. Without assessing factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting\u2014and identifying or implementing actions to further clarify and educate taxpayer",
    "gao_GAO-18-419": "Why GAO Did This Study The Secret Service provides protection for 12 individuals\u20144 presidential candidates, 2 vice presidential candidates, and 6 of the candidates' family members\u2014at the request of the President. The 2016 presidential campaign was the first presidential campaign to provide such protection. The Secret Service reimburses the campaign committees for the seats occupied by special agents on chartered aircraft. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's 2016 presidential campaign travel expenses and payment of those expenses. This report examines (1) how much the Secret Service incurred in transportation, lodging, and other travel-related expenses when providing protection during the 2016 presidential campaign, and (2) to what extent the Secret Service reasonably assures that payments and reimbursements for travel-related protection expenses were made in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies during the 2016 presidential campaign. GAO analyzed the 2016 presidential campaign travel expenses for 12 individuals, reviewed the Secret Service's lodging payments and charter aircraft reimbursements, and interviewed Secret Service officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) incurred approximately $58 million in travel expenses for 12 individuals protected during the 2016 presidential campaign. Travel expenses included airfare, vehicle rentals, hotel rooms, meals and incidental expenses, and baggage charges for special agents accompanying protected individuals. The $58 million in travel expenses was used by the Secret Service to support 3,236 travel stops made by the 12 protected individuals throughout the presidential campaign. The Secret Service did not always follow its travel policies, resulting in overpayments of at least an estimated $3.9 million. For example, the Secret Service did not reimburse the four campaign committees for the correct amounts for special agents' seats on chartered aircraft during the 2016 presidential campaign. Specifically, the Secret Service did not follow its policy for determining the amount to reimburse for special agents' seats on chartered aircraft. Specifically, the Secret Service is to pay the lower of two applicable fares (lowest available first-class airfare for a flight segment (one airport to another airport) to the pro rata fare of the charter (total charter cost divided by the number of passengers). The Secret Service is then to reimburse the campaign committees for the lower of the two fares. The Secret Service's policy for determining the amount to reimburse has been used since at least 1977. Under this policy, the Secret Service is to pay the lower of two applicable fares when reimbursing the campaign committees for special agents' travel on chartered aircraft. Specifically, according to the policy the Secret Service is to compare the lowest commercially available first-class airfare for a flight segment (one airport to another airport) to the pro rata fare of the charter (total charter cost divided by the number of passengers).

    "gao_GAO-19-35": "Why GAO Did This Study OPM is responsible for designing and promulgating regulations, policy, and guidance covering all aspects of the employee life cycle from hire to retire, including performance management. GAO was asked to review federal employee performance management. This report (1) describes federal employee perceptions of performance management as measured by the results of selected statements from OPM's annual survey of federal employees, the Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (FEVS); (2) identifies practices that selected agencies use to develop and implement strategies to improve performance management; and (3) evaluates OPM's guidance and resources to support agency efforts to improve performance management government-wide. GAO analyzed FEVS data from 2010 through 2017; analyzed selected agency performance management practices; and interviewed OPM officials. What GAO Found From 2010 through 2017, surveyed employees generally demonstrated positive responses to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) annual survey of federal employees, the Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). Employees generally demonstrated positive responses to the statements related to four of OPM's five performance management phases, including: planning and setting expectations; continually monitoring performance; developing the capacity to perform; rating periodically to summarize performance; and rewarding good performance. From 2010 to 2017, an estimated 39 percent of surveyed employees consistently agreed when asked statements related to how their agency rewards performance. GAO found that selected agencies demonstrated some similar practices that may help improve employee performance management. For example, employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency consistently agreed or strongly agreed to selected FEVS statements related to the five phases of OPM's performance management cycle. While these agencies developed different performance management systems to reflect their specific structures and priorities, GAO found a number of practices common to all four agencies that are intended to help reinforce effective employee performance management and improve agency performance. For example, all four agencies were building a culture of analyzing their FEVS results to identify areas of improvement and create action plans around the analysis. In addition, three of the four selected agencies also used other practices, such as using other available survey results to corroborate identified action plans and identify additional areas needing support to create a more complete picture of the employee perspective. OPM provides performance management resources to agencies on its website, but some information is not easily accessible or routinely shared. For example, OPM provides guidance and resources to agencies on its performance management website, but some information is not regularly updated and can be challenging to find. Establishing a process to regularly update its performance management website with new guidance and resources would provide them with the most recent guidance and resources available. OPM could better lead efforts to identify and share emerging performance management research and innovation. For example, OPM has several efforts in place that allow agencies to share promising information with each other such as at its semiannual Performance Management Forums (forums), annual Performance Management Steering Committee meetings, and through the Performance Management Portal (portal). However, there is no formal process in place or mechanism for agencies to routinely and independently share their own experiences and lessons learned in implementing performance management efforts. Establishing a mechanism to allow agencies to routinely share promising practices and lessons learned from their experiences could assist agencies that are undertaking or considering similar efforts and help inform agencies' decision-making related to performance management. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OPM (1) regularly update its performance management website to include all available guidance and resources, (2) develop and implement a mechanism for agencies to routinely and independently share promising practices and lessons learned, and (3) develop a strategic approach for identifying and sharing emerging research and innovations in performance management. OPM agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-217": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD has a demanding responsibility to manage its acquisition workforce. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 mandated that GAO review DOD's efforts to develop program managers. This report addresses (1) how leading organizations train, mentor, retain, and select program managers and (2) the extent to which military service practices for training, mentoring, retaining, and selecting program managers align with those of leading organizations. GAO reviewed relevant legislation, DOD, and military service documents and interviewed DOD, military service, and commercial company officials. GAO also interviewed DOD and military service officials. What GAO Found GAO identified 10 practices, across four distinct areas, used by leading organizations to develop program manager talent based on its extensive review of Project Management Institute documents and discussions with AstraZeneca, Boeing, DXC Technology, and Rio Tinto. These four areas correspond to the internal control standards discussed previously. Program managers at these companies share similar basic responsibilities with DOD program managers, including overseeing the development and production of goods and services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Leading organizations provide a mix of formal and informal training opportunities focused on sharing knowledge and providing experiences that prepare people for program management, offer mentoring opportunities to guide people along career paths use a mix of financial and nonfinancial incentives to retain high select program managers based on identification of high-potential talent and then assign program managers based on program needs. Boeing representatives noted that by using a combination of these practices, over the past 15 years, their program managers have primarily left positions due to promotion or retirement. Rio Tinto representatives noted that in a challenging environment for finding suitable external talent, they have been able to use these practices to successfully develop most of the talent they need internally. DXC Technology representatives noted that these practices enabled their program managers to receive better feedback and address skill gaps. AstraZeneca representatives noted that these practices have made it easier for people to get the range of experiences they need to move into leadership positions. Leading organizations use a mix of financial and nonfinancial incentives to retain high select program managers based on identification of high-potential talent and then assign program managers based on program needs. GAO's analysis of the practices used by the military services to train, mentor, retain, and select program managers for major defense acquisition programs shows a mixed level of alignment with the leading practices. For example, practices used by each of the military services align extensively with 4 of the 10 leading practices. For 5 of the 10, practices used by at least one of the military services do not align extensively with leading practices, and for the remaining practice related to financial rewards for good performance, none of the services' practices align extensively. GAO discussed these assessments with each military service Director for Acquisition Career Management, and they generally agreed with GAO's assessments. What GAO Recommends GAO is making eight recommendations to the Air Force, two to the Army, and three to the Navy to address areas of civilian and military program manager retention and selection that do not align extensively with leading practices. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations and in some cases identified ongoing efforts among the military services to address the recommendations and increase alignment with leading practices.",
    "gao_GAO-18-451T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Patent Act authorizes the CBM program, which allows parties accused of patent infringement to file a petition with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board challenging the validity of 359 patents. The CBM program allows parties to challenge patents that describe a technological invention that is not abstract and implemented on a generic computer. The CBM program is intended to help patent owners assert patents that are not abstract and implemented on a generic computer. This testimony discusses (1) the number of patents challenged under the CBM program and the outcomes of these patents, (2) the extent to which the Patent Trial and Appeal Board has completed all trials under AIA-authorized proceedings and taken steps to analyze decisions and improve proceedings, and (3) the extent to which stakeholders have agreed the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents. This statement is based on GAO's March 2018 report, which examined the CBM program and the outcomes of patents challenged under the program. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed officials from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court; and reviewed relevant federal standards for internal control. What GAO Found More than 350 patents have been challenged under the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (CBM) program, and about one-third of these patents were ruled unpatentable. Stakeholders GAO interviewed suggested several possible reasons for the decline in CBM petitions, including recent decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court that clarified which patents are eligible for CBM review; that CBM petitioners successfully targeted the lowest-quality business method patents\u2014 patents that should not have been issued because they did not meet the patentability requirements\u2014in the early years of the program, and now those patents have been eliminated; and that owners of business method patents are more wary of asserting their intellectual property through infringement lawsuits and risking its invalidation.

    "gao_GAO-19-122": "Why GAO Did This Study FPS is responsible for protecting federal facilities and the people working in and visiting those facilities. FPS has been in NPPD since 2010, and it has been in NPPD for more than 15 years. In November 2018, legislation was enacted that could result in FPS moving for a third time, although the location has not been determined. This legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to, within 90 days after the completion of GAO's review, determine the appropriate placement for FPS within DHS and begin transfer of FPS to that entity. GAO was asked to review FPS's placement. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected agencies and FPS met key organizational placement criteria, and (2) the steps DHS has taken to assess potential placement options. GAO reviewed relevant legislation and interviewed officials from FPS, selected agencies, and stakeholders. GAO also reviewed FPS's fiscal year 2019 budget request to Congress and past work. What GAO Found GAO found that none of the selected agencies met all the organizational placement criteria; thus, any of the organizational placement options could result in both benefits and trade-offs. For example, while placing FPS in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), and the Secret Service could provide FPS benefits in areas related to mission, responsibilities, and information sharing, there could be some adverse effect on FPS's law enforcement operations or other activities.

    "gao_GAO-18-599": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is responsible for enumerating the nation's population. The Bureau has partnered with governments, businesses, and local community organizations to help promote the census. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 directed the Bureau to conduct its fiscal year 2018 partnership and communications efforts in preparation for the 2020 Census at a level and staffing no less than the Bureau conducted during fiscal year 2008. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's efforts to help address the longstanding challenge of enumerating hard-to-count groups in the 2020 Census. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Bureau plans to enhance outreach to and the enumeration of hard-to-count groups in the 2020 Census, and (2) the challenges the Bureau faces in managing and integrating its hard-to-count efforts. GAO reviewed Bureau planning documents and interviewed Bureau officials. What GAO Found The Bureau plans to enhance outreach to and the enumeration of hard-to-count groups in the 2020 Census, but estimates total spending is similar to what it reported spending on those efforts for the 2010 Census after adjusting for inflation. Specifically, the Bureau may spend about $850 million in its outreach to promote the 2020 Census, compared to nearly $830 million in total spending in comparable categories for the 2010 Census. Despite this planned increase in partnership specialists, the Bureau's total estimated spending on partnership staff--$248 million--is less than the $334 million the Bureau reported spending in the same cost category for 2010 after adjusting for inflation. This change is in part because the Bureau does not plan to hire any partnership assistants to support the 2020 Census. According to Bureau officials, this shift in hiring toward more partnership specialists will enable a greater focus on creating more partnerships and require greater reliance on partner organizations to help with staffing for outreach and promotion events in local communities that partnership assistants were used for in the 2010 Census. The Bureau faces an internal management and external workforce challenge in managing and integrating its hard-to-count efforts in the 2020 Census. According to Bureau officials, over one-third of its 35 operations (14 of 35) are designed, at least in part, to help improve the enumeration of hard-to-count groups. These efforts range from the earliest field data collection operations\u2014such as address canvassing when the Bureau aims to identify all possible addresses where people live, including hidden housing units such as basement apartments or attics\u2014to some of its later field operations, such as nonresponse follow-up when census enumerators visit each household that did not self-respond. The detailed operational plans for 10 of the Bureau's 14 hard-to-count-related operations have been documented and released publicly. However, GAO found that several of the detailed plans already released\u2014while self-described as being updated over time to reflect changes in strategies based on ongoing planning, research, and testing\u2014are nearly two years old and may not reflect more recent decisions made. Attention by Bureau management to the details of these operational plans as they are updated will be critical to ensure that their interdependencies with other efforts are accounted for. Similarly, as of May 2018, little detail is available about what interdependencies the other 4 hard-to-count related efforts will have on the overall 2020 Census Operational Plan and on the Bureau's efforts to improve the enumeration of the hard-to-count in particular. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Commerce take steps to ensure that forthcoming changes and decisions on hard-to-count related efforts are integrated with other hard-to-count related efforts across the Bureau's decentralized operations. The Department of Commerce agreed with GAO's recommendations and said it would develop an action plan to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-336T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees the Part D program, which provides prescription drug coverage to about 1.2 million beneficiaries. CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor and plan sponsors. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of opioid prescribing. This statement discusses (1) CMS's oversight of beneficiaries who receive opioids, and (2) CMS's oversight of providers who prescribe opioids. This statement is based on GAO's October 2017 report, Medicare Part D: CMS Delegates Monitoring of Beneficiaries' Opioid Prescriptions to Plan Sponsors, but Does Not Have Sufficient Information on Those Most at Risk for Harm ( GAO-17-32, Oct. 17, 2017). GAO reviewed CMS guidance, CMS data, and CMS's oversight efforts. GAO also interviewed CMS officials and six plan sponsors. What GAO Found CMS delegates monitoring of beneficiaries who receive opioids to plan sponsors, but does not have sufficient information on those most at risk for harm. GAO found that CMS provides guidance to Medicare Part D plan sponsors on how the plan sponsors should monitor opioid overutilization problems among Part D beneficiaries. The agency includes this guidance in its annual letters to plan sponsors, known as call letters; it also provided a supplemental memo to plan sponsors in 2012. Among other things, these guidance documents instructed plan sponsors to implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to monitor beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. As part of the DUR systems, CMS requires plan sponsors to have methods to identify beneficiaries who are potentially overusing specific drugs or groups of drugs, including opioids. Also in 2013, CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS), which outlines criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids and to oversee sponsors' compliance with CMS's opioid overutilization policy. Plan sponsors may use the OMS criteria for their DUR systems, but they have some flexibility to develop their own targeting criteria within CMS guidance. GAO also found that CMS does not have comparable information on most beneficiaries who receive high doses of opioids\u2014regardless of the number of providers and pharmacies used\u2014and who therefore may be at risk for harm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. These guidelines note that long-term use of high doses of opioids\u2014those above a daily MED greater than 90 mg per day\u2014are associated with significant risk of harm and should be avoided if possible. GAO found that CMS has revised its current OMS criteria to include more at-risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018. However, CMS does not have plans to do so as part of its OMS. GAO also found that CMS oversees providers who prescribe opioids to Medicare Part D beneficiaries through its contractor and plan sponsors, but efforts do not specifically monitor opioid prescribing. CMS requires its contractor to identify providers who prescribe high amounts of Schedule II drugs, which include but are not limited to opioids. Using prescription drug data, the contractor conducts a peer comparison of providers' prescribing practices to identify outlier providers\u2014the highest prescribers of Schedule II drugs. CMS's oversight actions focus broadly on prescription drugs, and do not specifically address opioids. GAO concluded that although these efforts provide valuable information, CMS lacks all the information necessary to adequately oversee opioid prescribing. CMS's oversight actions focus broadly on Schedule II drugs rather than specifically on opioids. For example, the contractor's analyses to identify outlier providers do not indicate the extent to which they may be overprescribing opioids specifically. Without specifically identifying opioids in these analyses\u2014or an alternate source of data\u2014CMS lacks data on providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids, and therefore cannot assess progress toward meeting its goals related to reducing opioid use, which would be consistent with federal internal control standards. Federal internal control standards require agencies to conduct monitoring activities and to use quality information to achieve objectives and address risks. As a result, GAO recommended that CMS require plan sponsors to report on investigations and other actions taken related to providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids. HHS did not concur with this recommendation. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement.",
    "gao_GAO-18-436T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is responsible for regulating a wide range of activities, including regulating the activities of regulated entities, regulating the activities of regulated entities, and regulating the activities of the general public. Agencies issue regulations to help regulated entities comply with agency regulations, and issue regulatory guidance to clarify policies and address new issues and circumstances more quickly than may be possible using rulemaking. This testimony discusses (1) how agencies decide whether to issue regulations or guidance and (2) the extent to which they adhere to OMB requirements and internal controls when developing guidance. This statement is based on GAO's 2015 report on guidance processes at USDA, Education, HHS, and DOL, and selected updates from the three administrations GAO reviewed. GAO analyzed agency guidance documents, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Agencies can better ensure effectiveness of guidance through consistent adherence to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements and internal controls when developing guidance. The four agencies GAO reviewed considered a number of factors before deciding whether to issue regulations or undertake rulemaking. Among these factors were whether officials intended for the document to be binding (in which case they issued a regulation). OMB staff concurred that agencies understood what types of direction to regulated entities must go through the regulatory process. Officials from all four agencies also told GAO that they understood when guidance was inappropriate and when regulation was necessary. The agencies used guidance for multiple purposes and differed in the amount of guidance they issued. The purposes of guidance included explaining or interpreting regulations, clarifying policies in response to questions or compliance findings, disseminating suggested practices or leadership priorities, and providing grant administration information. Guidance documents provide agencies valuable flexibility to help regulated agencies comply with agency regulations, and address new issues and circumstances more quickly than may be possible using rulemaking. Guidance documents that meet OMB's definition of \u201csignificant\u201d are subject to the regulatory practices and requirements established by OMB. Guidance that does not fall under the definition of \u201csignificant\u201d is not subject to the OMB Bulletin, and those guidance procedures are left to agency discretion. The four agencies GAO reviewed considered few of their guidance documents to be significant. As of February 2015, agencies listed the following numbers of significant guidance documents on their websites: Education, 139; DOL, 36; and USDA, 34. GAO found opportunities for agencies to improve regulatory guidance processes by strengthening compliance with OMB requirements for significant guidance and the use of management controls for producing their guidance documents. In 2015, GAO made 11 recommendations to USDA, HHS, DOL and Education to better ensure the adherence to OMB requirements for approval and public access of regulatory guidance, to strengthen the use of internal controls in guidance processes, and to improve the usability of websites with online guidance, three of which remain open. These recommendations for HHS remain open as well as an additional recommendation concerning developing written procedures for agency approval of written guidance. These actions would help to ensure appropriate review and use of these documents, and both could also facilitate opportunities for affected parties and stakeholders to provide feedback on those documents. For guidance that does not meet OMB's definition of significant, GAO found opportunities for agencies to improve guidance development, review, evaluation, and dissemination processes by strengthening their adherence to internal controls. Wider adoption of these practices could better ensure that agencies have internal controls in place to promote quality and consistency of their guidance development processes, and to ensure that guidance policies, processes, and practices achieve desired results, and prevent and detect errors. GAO recommended that agencies strengthen their application of internal controls to guidance practices by adopting practices, such as determining appropriate levels of review to manage risk, maintaining written policies and procedures for the production of non-significant guidance, and regularly evaluating whether issued guidance was effective and up-to-date. During the transition periods at the end of each of the three administrations GAO reviewed, agencies published more economically significant and significant final regulations relative to comparable time periods earlier in each administration. In particular, the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations published on average roughly 2.5 times more economically significant regulations during transition periods than during nontransition periods. But agencies more often, relative to nontransition periods, provided the public an opportunity to influence the development of the transition-period regulations by providing advanced notice of their issuance in the Unified Agenda, and opportunities to comment on proposed regulations before they were finalized.",
    "gao_GAO-18-358": "Why GAO Did This Study The NDAA 2017 required DOD to develop an implementation plan for TRICARE Select, a new preferred provider option, which is intended to modernize the TRICARE benefit and improve beneficiaries' access to care. The NDAA 2017 also required GAO to review DOD's implementation plan. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's TRICARE Select implementation plan addressed the elements required by the NDAA 2017 and (2) the extent to which DOD's implementation plan for TRICARE Select reflects the current approach for establishing access standards. GAO reviewed DOD's TRICARE Select implementation plan and interviewed DOD officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense's (DOD) TRICARE Select implementation plan included the seven elements mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2017 and addressed most of the leading practices for strategic management planning. For example, the plan clearly articulated a mission statement, which is \u201cto ensure beneficiaries receive the right level of care, at the right time, delivered by the right provider.\u201d Additionally, for six of the mandated elements, DOD's implementation plan outlined the goal, strategies to achieve the goal, and how DOD will assess progress. However, the plan did not address the leading practices related to strategies or plans to assess progress for element G, which is a subset of the core quality performance metrics that can be used in future contracts. For example, the plan did not address the leading practice related to identifying the challenges and risks that could affect the success of the element. DOD officials told GAO that they considered and planned for the challenges and risks associated with certain elements, including establishing a monitoring and remediation process to help ensure contractors meet the 85 percent network coverage requirement. However, DOD officials told GAO that they considered and planned for the challenges and risks associated with certain elements\u2014including establishing a monitoring and remediation process to help ensure contractors meet the 85 percent network coverage requirement\u2014even though this was not described in the plan. DOD officials told GAO that they did not intend to suggest in the plan that the TRICARE Prime access standards would be applied to TRICARE Select. Instead, these officials explained that they meant that the access standards for TRICARE Select would be evaluated with the same tools as the access standards for TRICARE Prime. Standards for internal control in the federal government state that management should externally communicate the necessary information to achieve the entity's objectives. Because the implementation plan does not reflect DOD's current approach, Congress may be lacking important information, including what responsibilities the contractors have in terms of providing access to care, impeding its ability to provide oversight. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD provide written documentation of its approach to developing and approving the TRICARE Select access standards, as well as the final access standards, to Congress. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-506T": "Why GAO Did This Study The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for coordinating and implementing the care and placement of unaccompanied children in the custody of DHS. In 2015, GAO reported that the referral and transfer of unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters was inefficient and vulnerable to error. GAO recommended that DHS and HHS jointly develop and implement a collaborative process for the referral and transfer of unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters. In response, DHS and HHS finalized a memorandum of agreement in February 2016. GAO also reported that ORR has taken steps to improve monitoring of its grantees, including reviewing its monitoring protocols and ensuring all grantees were monitored over a 2-year period. GAO also reported that ORR is taking steps to ensure its monitoring processes and protocols are more systematic and uniform. This testimony is based on GAO's 2016 report, which examined the extent to which ORR has (1) implemented a collaborative process for the referral and transfer of unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters, (2) monitored its grantees' provision of services, and (3) collected additional information on the services provided to unaccompanied children after they are released from ORR custody. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed HHS and ORR officials. What GAO Found In response to a recommendation in GAO's 2015 report, DHS and HHS have agreed to establish a collaborative process for the referral and transfer of unaccompanied children from DHS to ORR shelters, but the process has not yet been implemented. It will be important to ensure that, once implemented, this process has clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each agency, as GAO recommended. In response to a recommendation in GAO's 2016 report, ORR reported taking steps to improve monitoring of its grantees, including reviewing its monitoring protocols and ensuring all grantees were monitored over a 2-year period. These steps should increase the timeliness, completeness, and consistency of ORR's monitoring; however, ORR needs to ensure that its updated processes and protocols are fully implemented and in use. In 2016, GAO reported that ORR relies on grantees to provide care for unaccompanied children, such as housing and educational, medical, and therapeutic services, and to document in children's case files the services they provide. However, in GAO's 2016 report, GAO found that documents\u2014such as legal presentation acknowledgment forms, records of group counseling sessions, or clinical progress notes\u2014were often missing from the 27 randomly selected case files GAO reviewed. In addition, GAO found that ORR's most comprehensive monitoring of grantees occurred during on-site visits, but that onsite visits to facilities were inconsistent. In 2014, ORR revised its on-site monitoring program to ensure better coverage of grantees and implemented a biennial on-site monitoring schedule. Nevertheless, ORR did not meet its goal to visit all of its facilities by the end of fiscal year 2015, citing lack of resources. In 2016, GAO reported that ORR grantees that provide day-to-day care of unaccompanied children are responsible for identifying and screening sponsors prior to releasing children to them. In addition, GAO reported that ORR reported taking various steps to collect additional information on the services provided to unaccompanied children after they are released from ORR custody. GAO welcomed this progress, but continue to believe that further steps are needed to fully address GAO's recommendation. In 2016, GAO reported that ORR was in a position to compile the data it collects on post-release services, and to share the data internally and externally with other federal and state agencies to help them better understand the circumstances these children face when they are released to their sponsors. GAO welcomed this progress, but continue to believe that further steps are needed to fully address GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-326": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's acquisition of major automated information systems (MAIS) is critical to the department's ability to support its mission. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 mandated that GAO select, assess, and report on selected MAIS programs annually through March 2018. GAO assessed the extent to which (1) selected MAIS programs have changed their planned cost and schedule estimates and met performance targets; and (2) selected MAIS programs have used leading IT acquisition practices, including requirements and risk management. GAO compared DOD's policies for managing MAIS programs with leading IT management practices and interviewed officials. What GAO Found All of the 15 selected MAIS programs had either increased or decreased their planned cost estimates, and 10 of them had delays in their planned schedule estimates when comparing the first acquisition program baseline to the most recent acquisition program baseline estimates. The changes in the cost estimates ranged from a decrease of $1.6 billion (-41 percent) to an increase of $1.5 billion (163 percent), and slippages in the schedule estimates ranged from a delay of 5 years to a delay of 5 months. Further, 9 of the 15 selected programs had conducted testing in which GAO could report on the number of performance targets met for each program. Of those 9, 6 programs reported that they had met all of their performance targets. The remaining 3 programs reported that they met several but not all performance targets. The three selected MAIS programs that GAO evaluated had fully implemented most, but not all, of the five leading practices for managing requirements and the seven leading practices for managing risks. Specifically, two of three programs implemented all of the requirements management practices, while one program implemented most, but not all, of the practices. Further, one of three programs implemented all of the risk management practices, while two programs implemented most, but not all, of the practices. Until DOD updates its policy for MAIS business programs to adhere to leading practices on the establishment of baseline estimates on cost and schedule to include threshold estimates on cost and schedule to identify when programs may be at high risk, stakeholders may not have the information they need to manage and oversee MAIS business programs. Until DOD updates its policy for MAIS business programs to adhere to leading practices on the establishment of baseline estimates on cost and schedule to include threshold estimates on cost and schedule to identify when programs may be at high risk, stakeholders may not have the information they need to manage and oversee MAIS business programs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD update its policy for MAIS business programs to adhere to leading practices on the establishment of baseline estimates on cost and schedule to include threshold estimates on cost and schedule to identify when programs may be at high risk. DOD partially concurred with the first recommendation and concurred with the second and third recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-214": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD's FMS program is a multibillion dollar program that transfers defense articles and services to foreign customers. Foreign customers may request price and availability data to inform their acquisition strategy, obtain a sense of affordability, and for budget planning. GAO was asked to review the FMS process. This report (1) describes foreign military sales requests DOD received from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) assesses DOD's guidance on developing price and availability data, (3) describes how DOD develops price and availability data for the requested capability, and (4) identified factors that can influence the timeliness for DOD to provide price and availability data to the customer. GAO analyzed DOD's price and availability data for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the most recent 5-year period available. GAO also interviewed DOD officials and contractors and foreign customers. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) reported receiving 3,038 requests for price and availability data from foreign customers from 93 countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Foreign customer requests included services and items such as training and support services for weapon systems, missiles and ammunition, aircraft, and communication equipment. Foreign customer requests included services and items such as training and support services for weapon systems, missiles and ammunition, aircraft, and communication equipment. GAO found that most requests came from the same foreign customers. Specifically, 10 customers accounted for 56 percent of requests, with one customer accounting for 28 percent of all requests during the 5-year period within GAO's review. Among DOD components, the military departments\u2014Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2014received almost all price and availability requests, with the Army receiving slightly more requests over the 5-year period. The Navy and Army generally captured the status of a response in the system, identifying when a response is in development, has been sent to the customer, or has been canceled but, according to security assistance officials, this information may not be entered consistently. In addition, the Air Force does not generally update the status of a response in the system to reflect that the Air Force provided price and availability data to the customer. DOD's guidance allows for flexibility in developing price and availability data and reflects leading practices for using quality information. The guidance states that price and availability data should serve as rough order of magnitude estimates of the cost and availability of defense items or services and are for rough-order planning purposes. DOD officials said that they strive to offer a complete and sustainable capability, referred to as the total package approach. Using this approach, DOD takes into account the related support, such as training, logistics, spare parts, warranties, contractor support, and other considerations necessary for operating and sustaining the defense items or services being purchased. DOD officials said that they generally used a total package approach when developing price and availability data. For example, military department officials developed price and availability data that not only included the items and services requested by the customer, but also included rough order of magnitude estimates for additional costs to reflect the expected ownership costs. DOD officials said that they were providing the customer with estimates that would more closely reflect expected costs if the customer proceeded with the purchase. Various factors can influence the level of effort and information involved in developing price and availability data, some of which may also affect how long a response takes and whether the 45-day timeframe suggested by DOD's guidance is achieved. When a foreign customer requests price and availability data, DOD and defense contractors, if involved, expend time and resources to provide a response, all without any certainty that a sale will materialize. As such, DOD officials and defense contractors determine what level of response is appropriate, given the nature of the customer's request and whether it includes non-standard items or items that require customization, among other things. Various factors can influence the timeliness of DOD's responses. For example, the volume of requests and competing priorities can affect the timeliness and the level of effort applied to the response. Individually and combined, these factors, as well as the overall process, can influence response times. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-550": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS has a long history of managing large acquisition programs. In recent years, GAO has identified the importance of having a well-defined requirements development process. GAO was asked to review DHS requirements development. This report examines (1) how often selected DHS programs changed requirements; and assesses the extent to which the selected components have (1) developed policies for requirements development, (2) established independent requirements organizations, and (3) taken steps to assess and train a requirements workforce. GAO reviewed DHS acquisition policies and acquisition program baselines, and interviewed DHS officials. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 14 programs with DHS-approved key performance parameters. What GAO Found GAO found that 9 of 14 programs from the seven Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components that GAO reviewed changed key performance parameters for various reasons after program approval and entry into the \u201cObtain\u201d phase. DHS had initially approved most programs' key performance parameters before DHS reestablished the Joint Requirements Council (JRC) in November 2014. GAO found that the causes of these changes varied, but included requirements did not accurately describe end user needs, were not achievable given available technologies, or that programs pursued greater capability than originally intended. GAO found that the causes of these changes varied, but included requirements did not accurately describe end user needs, were not achievable given available technologies, or that programs pursued greater capability than originally intended. GAO found that the absence of component-level policies, which are aligned with DHS's acquisition and requirements policies, contributes to an inability to properly mitigate capability gaps and meet mission and end user needs. Three of the seven DHS components GAO reviewed have established independent requirements development organizations, such as offices or directorates independent of the acquisition function. Among the reasons cited by these components' officials was recognition of the importance of the operational requirements development function for addressing capability gaps. Those that do not have separate requirements organizations cited, among other things, the smaller size of their components. However, according to key principles, independent lines of authority should develop operational requirements and manage acquisitions separately, regardless of size. GAO found that two of the seven components have assessed requirements workforce needs, and one has provided requirements specific training. Components gave different reasons why they have not yet taken one or more of these steps, including a lack of resources. Until the components assess their needs and take appropriate action, acquisition programs may continue to be at risk of not meeting end user needs, as they will not have a trained workforce to develop requirements. What GAO Recommends GAO is making 25 recommendations to DHS to ensure that (1) the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection finalizes and promulgates the Customs and Border Protection's draft policy for requirements development; (2) the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection's draft policy for requirements development is finalized and promulgated; (3) the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection's draft policy for requirements development is finalized and promulgated; and (4) the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection's draft policy for requirements development is finalized and promulgated. DHS concurred with all 25 recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to address them.",
    "gao_GAO-18-99": "Why GAO Did This Study NNSA manages five strategic materials programs, which include building unique new facilities, modifying and repairing existing facilities and equipment, and developing and deploying new technologies for processing and producing strategic nuclear materials. NNSA's strategic materials programs are intended to ensure the supply of each of the five strategic materials as well as the capability to process them. GAO was asked to review NNSA's strategic materials programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA has defined program requirements for the strategic materials programs and (2) the extent to which NNSA has implemented program requirements for the strategic materials programs. GAO reviewed program requirements and program documents, and interviewed NNSA officials. What GAO Found The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has defined program requirements for the five strategic materials programs, including the lithium program. NNSA has established the roles and responsibilities of the programs' managers. NNSA has generally designated the strategic materials programs as \u201cEnhanced Management B,\u201d the most rigorous designation applicable to this type of program. NNSA officials told GAO that they are making progress in implementing the program requirements outlined for each of the strategic materials programs, although some are further along than others. However, these officials said that relatively few staff had been assigned to these programs, which has challenged implementation efforts. For example, the plutonium manager said more staff were needed to successfully implement the program, and the lithium lead point of contact said that at least two full-time staff members would be required to accomplish the work needed to make the lithium program meet program requirements. NNSA officials cited competing agency priorities and current perceived staffing limits as the primary impediments to assigning more staff to these programs. For example, NNSA officials said that competing agency priorities to modernize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and modernize and extend the lives of current nuclear weapons have meant that federal staff are in high demand across the agency. NNSA officials said that they have limited flexibility when it comes to increasing federal staff levels. Specifically, in each year that the total number of federal employees at NNSA exceeds 1,690, the Administrator is required by law to submit to the congressional defense committees a report justifying such excess. In the NNSA Administrator's testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development in June 2017, he stated that since 2010, NNSA's program funding had increased 28 percent, while its federal staffing levels had decreased by 17 percent. He said that initial results from a yet-to-be-completed study by the Office of Personnel Management in support of the Reform of Government Initiative indicate the need for a 20 percent increase in federal staff at NNSA. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NNSA determine the critical skills and competencies that will be needed for the strategic materials programs and use this determination to develop strategies for addressing challenges, if any, related to the number, deployment, and alignment of program staff. NNSA agreed with GAO's recommendation and stated that the recommendation is consistent with the programs' current evolution.",
    "gao_GAO-18-354": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS's grant programs provide federal assistance to states, localities, and other entities, such as ports or transit agencies, to prevent, prepare for, protect against, respond to, and recover from, and mitigate a natural or manmade disaster, including terrorist incidents. The DHS Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DHS's risk-based grant assessment model. This report examines (1) factors that affected the allocation of grant funds to states and urban areas from fiscal years 2008 through 2018, (2) the extent to which DHS has improved its risk-based grant assessment model, and (3) the extent to which DHS has made use of recognized scientific practices in maintaining its risk-based grant assessment model. GAO reviewed DHS and FEMA documents and interviewed DHS and FEMA officials. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2008 through 2018, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSP) and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant programs have generally declined, but have remained consistent since fiscal year 2016. For example, annual funding for the SHSP decreased from about $861 million in fiscal year 2008, to $402 million in fiscal year 2018. During this same period, annual funding for the UASI also declined, from about $782 million in fiscal year 2008 to $580 million in fiscal year 2018. However, annual funding for the UASI program has been higher than the SHSP program since fiscal year 2010. Since 2008, FEMA has taken a number of steps to assess and improve its risk-based grant assessment model for allocating grants based on past reviews, GAO's prior recommendations, and various changes related to evolving terrorist threats and real-world scenarios. For example, FEMA added a Vulnerability Index to its risk model in 2011 in response to GAO's 2008 recommendation. Most recently, for fiscal year 2018, FEMA has included a \"soft target index.\" According to FEMA officials, this index was added to account for the current threat for areas where crowds congregate. FEMA officials stated that this index was added to account for the current threat for areas where crowds congregate. FEMA officials stated that this index was added to account for the current threat for areas where crowds congregate. FEMA officials stated that this index was added to account for the current threat for areas where crowds congregate. FEMA officials stated that they focus their limited time and resources on developing the executive summary-level materials that DHS leadership will use to determine final grant eligibility and grant allocation amounts. FEMA officials agreed with GAO's analysis of FEMA's supporting documentation, and officials stated that maintaining additional documentation could further assist reviewers. Documenting how subject matter expert assumptions are made would help FEMA increase the transparency of the model for key internal and external stakeholders. FEMA has not subjected its risk-based grant assessment model to a peer review by independent, external technical experts, as previously recommended by the National Research Council (NRC). According to FEMA officials, its risk assessment methodology has undergone comprehensive internal reconsideration over time to better reflect real-world scenarios, but such reviews have not included external peer reviews. FEMA officials stated that the agency is exploring the possibility of participating in a DHS collaborative group to internally review and provide feedback on the model's underlying assumptions and methods. Such a group could review the underlying components of the current risk-based grant assessment model and suggest improvements, as well as present and evaluate other risk assessment theories and approaches. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FEMA fully document the underlying assumptions and justifications that form the basis of its risk-based grant assessment model, perform sensitivity analyses to verify how changes to the risk-based grant assessment model could affect the resulting risk scores, and document the results. FEMA generally concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-520T": "Why GAO Did This Study Federal agencies and our nation's critical infrastructures are dependent on computerized (cyber) information systems and electronic data to process, maintain, and report essential information, and to operate and control physical processes. Ineffective security controls to protect these systems and data could have a significant impact on a broad array of government operations and assets. GAO has designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. This statement addresses the extent to which (1) DHS has implemented programs and activities to improve and promote cybersecurity of federal and private-sector computer systems and (2) DHS has taken actions to identify its cybersecurity workforce. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports and testimonies on federal and private-sector cybersecurity. GAO reviewed DHS's programs and activities and interviewed DHS officials. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has broad authorities to improve and promote cybersecurity of federal and private-sector computer systems. The federal laws and policies that underpin these authorities include the following: The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 clarified and expanded DHS's responsibilities for assisting with the implementation of, and overseeing, information security at federal agencies. These responsibilities include requirements to: develop, issue, and oversee agencies' implementation of binding operational directives to agencies, including directives for incident reporting, contents of annual agency reports, and other operational requirements; monitor agencies' implementation of information security policies provide operational and technical assistance to agencies, including by operating the federal information security incident center, deploying technology to continuously diagnose and mitigate threats, and conducting threat and vulnerability assessments of systems. The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 codified the role of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)\u2014a center established by DHS in 2009\u2014as the federal civilian interface for sharing information concerning cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis, and warnings to federal and nonfederal entities, including owners and operators of information systems supporting critical infrastructure. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015, among other things, sets forth authority for enhancing the sharing of cybersecurity-related information among federal and nonfederal entities. The act gives DHS's NCCIC responsibility for implementing this information sharing authority. The act also requires DHS to improve intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, as appropriate, by regularly deploying new technologies and modifying existing technologies. Long-standing federal policy as promulgated by a presidential policy directive, executive orders, and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan have designated DHS as a lead federal agency for coordinating, assisting, and sharing information with the private-sector to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats. DHS has made important progress in implementing these programs and activities. However, the department needs to take additional actions to ensure that it successfully mitigates cybersecurity risks on federal and private-sector computer systems and networks. For example, DHS has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014. However, its actions had not been timely and complete. For example, DHS had not met statutorily defined deadlines for completing actions to identify and assign codes to cybersecurity positions or ensured that its procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity positions addressed vacant positions, as required by the act. Further, although DHS had taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it had not identified or reported to the Congress on its department-wide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also had not annually reported its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management, as required; and it had not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed. DHS concurred with the six recommendations and stated that it plans to take actions to address them by June 2018. What GAO Recommends GAO has made about 2,500 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because they have not implemented many of these recommendations. As of March 2018, about 885 of GAO's prior information security-related recommendations had not been implemented.",
    "gao_GAO-18-22": "Why GAO Did This Study The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies to consider regulatory alternatives that maximize net benefits, to the extent permitted by law. Agencies also must consider alternative approaches to elicit compliance, such as alternative reporting methods or delaying compliance dates. GAO was asked to review how agencies make key decisions related to regulatory design, compliance and enforcement, and updating of regulations. This report describes how selected agencies report (1) making decisions on regulatory designs among available options, (2) making decisions to designate resources among available compliance and enforcement activities, and (3) evaluating those decisions, and also identifies (4) key considerations for decision makers related to regulatory design and enforcement. GAO reviewed relevant laws, executive orders, and guidance; interviewed agency officials; and reviewed relevant literature. GAO also interviewed subject matter specialists and agency officials. What GAO Found When agencies determine that they may need to regulate, they generally have multiple regulatory designs available to achieve their objectives. Agencies are directed by statute and Executive requirements to assess alternatives to regulatory action\u2014including not issuing new regulations\u2014and different ways of regulating. Available regulatory designs range from prescriptive regulations that specify the adoption of a certain technology or action to designs that generally provide regulated entities with more discretion and options for compliance, and in some instances hybrid designs that incorporate both prescriptive and less prescriptive elements. Alternatives to prescriptive regulations provide regulated entities with greater flexibility. For example, performance-based regulations require a certain outcome but allow regulated entities discretion to determine how they will achieve that outcome, while market-based regulations use tradeable permits or fees to influence behavior. Agencies reported that regulatory objectives sometimes required a prescriptive regulation or that in some instances regulated entities expressed a preference for prescriptiveness. For example, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) determined that requiring more frequent respirable dust sampling for mining occupations known to have high dust levels and requiring the use of certain monitoring devices to measure respirable coal dust exposure are necessary to limit exposure to respirable coal mine dust and thus reduce occupational lung diseases. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) officials told GAO that their export licensing regulations are necessarily prescriptive to narrowly target specific items as unacceptable for export due to national security or commercial sanctions against certain countries. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials told GAO that, while they try to achieve a balance between prescriptive and less prescriptive regulatory designs, in some instances prescriptive regulations are the only means of ensuring public health and safety. Despite a general preference for less prescriptive designs among selected agencies, officials from nine selected subcomponents told GAO that their regulatory objectives sometimes required a prescriptive regulation or that in some instances regulated entities expressed a preference for prescriptiveness. For example, based on data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, MSHA determined that requiring more frequent respirable dust sampling for mining occupations known to have high dust levels and requiring the use of certain monitoring devices to measure respirable coal dust exposure are necessary to limit exposure to respirable coal mine dust and thus reduce occupational lung diseases. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) officials told GAO that their export licensing regulations are necessarily prescriptive to narrowly target specific items as unacceptable for export due to national security or commercial sanctions against certain countries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) officials told GAO that they chose to promulgate the more prescriptive regulation instead of the more flexible, but challenging to implement, corporate-wide approach. EPA officials said that they ultimately chose to promulgate the more prescriptive regulation instead of the more flexible, but challenging to implement, corporate-wide approach.

    "gao_GAO-19-96": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing the nation's civil aviation system, which includes acquiring technology to screen and secure travelers at the nation's TSA-regulated airports. TSARA requires TSA to implement a number of reforms, including requiring TSA to submit a report to Congress on its performance in meeting small business contracting goals. GAO was asked to review TSA's implementation of TSARA. This report examines (1) TSA's implementation of TSARA requirements, (2) the extent to which TSA has reported to Congress on SRT-related acquisitions, and (3) the extent to which TSA has effectively communicated its implementation decisions. GAO reviewed TSA's acquisition policies and procedures, analyzed TSARA data, and interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) generally addressed the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act's (TSARA) requirements through its acquisitions policies and procedures. Since GAO's February 2016 report, TSA has also developed and issued an updated technology investment plan. Further, TSA has continued to submit an annual report to Congress on TSA's performance record in meeting its small business contracting goals. Through July 2018, TSA's narrow application of TSARA's report and certification provision resulted in no SRT acquisitions being reported to Congress pursuant to TSARA. In August 2018, TSA provided its first three notifications on SRT acquisitions to Congress under this provision. TSA officials said that none of the agency's acquisition activities from enactment through July 2018 invoked TSARA's report and certification provision because the activities did not align with TSA's policy that identifies SRT acquisitions subject to this provision.

    "gao_GAO-18-598T": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid is the nation's largest health care program, with over 73 million enrollees and over $596 billion in expenditures in fiscal year 2017. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the federal agency responsible for overseeing Medicaid. GAO has issued a number of reports on Medicaid, including the Medicaid program. This statement discusses (1) the risks to the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program, (2) GAO's prior work on Medicaid, and (3) the challenges CMS faces in overseeing Medicaid. This statement is based on GAO's prior work on Medicaid, including a review of CMS's Medicaid program integrity efforts and a review of CMS's efforts to manage fraud risks in Medicaid. GAO's prior work has included a review of CMS's Medicaid program integrity efforts, a review of state audits and investigations, and a review of CMS's Medicaid demonstrations. GAO also interviewed CMS officials. What GAO Found GAO's prior work has identified three broad areas of risk to the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program: improper payment rates, state use of supplemental payments, and oversight of demonstration programs. GAO's prior work has identified several concerns related to supplemental payments, including the need for more complete and accurate reporting, criteria for economical and efficient payments, and written guidance on the distribution of payments. GAO has also identified several concerns related to demonstrations, including the need for ensuring that (1) demonstrations meet the policy requirements of budget neutrality\u2014that is, they must not increase federal costs\u2014and (2) evaluations are used to determine whether demonstrations are having their intended effects. GAO has made 83 recommendations to CMS and HHS and suggested 4 matters for congressional consideration to address a variety of concerns about the Medicaid program. The agencies generally agreed with GAO's recommendations and have implemented 25 of these recommendations to date, and CMS still needs to take fundamental actions in three areas\u2014having more timely, complete, and reliable data; conducting fraud risk assessments; and strengthening federal-state collaboration\u2014to strengthen Medicaid oversight and better manage program risks. The federal government and the states play important roles in reducing improper payments and overseeing the Medicaid program, including overseeing spending on Medicaid supplemental payments and demonstrations. GAO's prior work shows that oversight of the Medicaid program could be further improved through leveraging and coordinating program integrity efforts with state agencies, state auditors, and other partners. GAO has routinely coordinated its audit efforts with state auditors and the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG).",
    "gao_GAO-19-33": "Why GAO Did This Study The authority allows agencies to replenish property that is not excess or surplus and that is still needed to meet agency missions. Agencies may choose between two transaction methods to replace property\u2014the exchange (trade-in) or the sale method, but must determine which method provides the greater return to the government, including administrative and overhead expenses. GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy (GSA OGP) reports summary data on exchange/sale transactions on behalf of most agencies. GAO was asked to review the use of the authority. This report (1) describes what is known about personal property exchange/sale transactions, as reported by federal agencies from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and (2) examines selected agencies' experiences using the authority and monitoring such activities. GAO analyzed GSA's annual summary data, reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed officials from GSA, DOD, and VA. What GAO Found According to GSA's annual summary data, 27 agencies reported using the personal property exchange/sale authority and received a total of about $3.1 billion in exchange allowances or sale proceeds from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. While many agencies used the authority, a few agencies, particularly GSA, together accounted for about 90 percent of all allowances and proceeds. Specifically, 5 of 27 agencies reported nearly all exchange allowances and sale proceeds. GSA accounted for about $1.9 billion of about $3.1 billion (or about 60 percent) of reported allowances and proceeds across the federal government. Four other agencies\u2014the Departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Defense, and the Interior\u2014accounted for about $934 million (or about 30 percent) of the total. The other 22 agencies using the authority reported about $332 million (or about 11 percent) in exchange allowances or sales proceeds over the 5-year period. While some agencies reported hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange allowances and sale proceeds, the data show that 10 federal agencies\u2014including the Departments of Labor, Office of Personnel Management, and the Social Security Administration\u2014reported relatively few transactions, which totaled less than $100,000 in exchange allowances and sales proceeds. GSA OGP officials consider the agency-reported data to provide a representative picture of the overall exchange/sale transactions occurring across the federal government. GSA OGP officials rely on the agencies to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the exchange/sale information. However, the selected agencies in GAO's review had different levels of understanding about the authority, which affected their experiences for how they used the authority and outcomes. For example, VA officials said they misunderstood key aspects of the exchange/sale authority, resulting in inefficiencies and data inaccuracies. GSA OGP officials stated that they recognize some agencies, such as VA, may experience confusion using the authority, that the regulations are misunderstood by agencies, and that aspects of the authority need to be clarified. However, the agencies in GAO's review had different levels of understanding about the authority, which affected their experiences for how they used the authority and outcomes. For example, VA officials said they misunderstood key aspects of the exchange/sale authority, resulting in inefficiencies and data inaccuracies. GSA OGP officials stated that they plan to address these areas of confusion by amending the regulations. However, officials estimate the rulemaking process will likely not be finalized for at least 2 years. As a result, the extent to which the rulemaking process will result in clarifying language is unknown. Until GSA takes action to address confusion, agencies may continue to misunderstand and not use the exchange/sale authority. GSA and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not monitor exchange/sale activities. GSA's Office of Administrative Services (GSA OAS) did not monitor its internal exchange/sale activities. GSA OAS officials said they have not been involved with any exchange/sale activities within the agency, and besides GSA Fleet, they do not know the extent to which other internal offices are using (or should be using) the authority. GSA OAS officials said they have not been involved with any exchange/sale activities within the agency, and besides GSA Fleet, they do not know the extent to which other internal offices are using (or should be using) the authority. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that GSA take actions to address specific areas of federal agency confusion with the exchange/sale authority, areas such as the process for selling property, reporting data, and distinguishing the exchange/sale process from the disposal process. GSA and VA agreed with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-20": "Why GAO Did This Study The Corps operates and maintains the inland waterways system, which includes locks and dams on the fuel-taxed inland waterways system. The Corps's Civil Works Program is responsible for balancing its navigation mission with other civil works missions, including hydropower generation, flood risk management, emergency response, environmental stewardship, and recreation. The Corps allocates funds for operations and maintenance and construction projects on the inland waterways system. GAO was asked to review the Corps' funding and management of the inland waterways system. This report (1) assesses how the Corps allocates funds for operations and maintenance projects for the inland waterways system; (2) describes how the Corps prioritizes and funds construction projects; and (3) assesses the effect of the current-funding approach on projects' costs and schedules. GAO analyzed Corps financial data on obligations for operations and maintenance for fiscal years 2006 through 2017 (the only years for which data were available), and allocations for construction and major rehabilitation of locks and dams for fiscal years 1997 through 2018. GAO also interviewed Corps officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) allocates funds for operations and maintenance projects for the inland waterways system based on economic benefits and risk but lacks a method of tracking deferred maintenance for inland waterways. The Corps does not know how much deferred maintenance exists for inland waterways because there is no agreed upon definition for deferred maintenance. Corps officials identified several challenges related to developing a useful definition with which to measure deferred maintenance. Without a measure\u2014or measures\u2014of deferred maintenance for inland waterways, the Corps is limited in its ability to identify preventive maintenance that could forestall more costly maintenance or rehabilitation in the future and communicate its estimated maintenance costs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congress. The Corps manages inland-waterways construction projects\u2014the modernization and rehabilitation of existing locks and dams (called major rehabilitation), or the construction of new structures\u2014to ensure the facilities continue to function and meet future requirements, and prioritizes these projects based on expected costs and benefits. Since at least 1995, all inland-waterways construction projects have been funded incrementally, meaning that annual appropriations have covered a portion of the project's estimated costs. However, this incremental-funding approach can lead to construction delays and increasing costs. As a result, other priority projects cannot be started, construction backlogs grow, and delays and closures continue to affect vessels at locks and dams that continue to deteriorate while waiting for replacement or rehabilitation. The Corps' capital investment strategy identifies an approach to funding priority projects given estimated Trust Fund revenue, but given the constrained fiscal environment and the unpredictable nature of the annual appropriations process, cost increases and schedule delays are likely to continue. Should Congress decide that additional funding is warranted to reduce this inefficiency, GAO included several options stakeholders have identified for doing so, such as increasing the federal share of construction costs for these projects. In the absence of increased funding, however, stakeholders GAO spoke to identified actions the Corps could take in coordination with Congress to increase the efficiency of contracting for inland waterways construction in a more efficient way. However, all of the options GAO discusses have important policy trade-offs and other challenges that the Corps and Congress would need to carefully consider. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Corps (1) define and measure deferred maintenance for inland waterways in a way that enables the Corps to clearly communicate estimated maintenance costs for maintenance needs, and (2) pursue ways to increase the Corps' ability to use available funding for inland waterways construction more efficiently and, should changes to the Corps' authority be necessary, develop a legislative proposal to request such authority. The Department of Defense concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-117": "Why GAO Did This Study The CHIP-IN Act authorizes a 5-year pilot program to test a new way of building needed medical facilities by using non-federal funding sources\u2014donors\u2014to leverage federal funds. The CHIP-IN Act also requires GAO to report on the pilot. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA has established a framework for effective pilot design for the CHIP-IN pilot program, (2) the extent to which the CHIP-IN donation approach can improve project implementation, and (3) the challenges to establishing the pilot. GAO reviewed relevant federal standards for internal control, interviewed VA officials, and analyzed documents from the Omaha project. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not yet established a framework for effective pilot design for the CHIP-IN pilot program. GAO identified five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program: articulating an assessment methodology, developing an evaluation plan, assessing scalability, and ensuring stakeholder communication. These practices enhance the quality, credibility, and usefulness of pilot program evaluations and help ensure that time and resources are used effectively. While each of the five practices serves a purpose on its own, taken together, they form a framework for effective pilot design. VA officials have worked to communicate with relevant stakeholders, but have not yet established objectives, developed an assessment methodology and evaluation plan, or documented how they will make decisions about scalability of the pilot program. Without clear, measurable objectives, stakeholders within VA may have different understandings of the pilot's purpose and intended outcomes. As a result, the agency risks pursuing projects that may not contribute to what VA hopes to learn or gain from the pilot. VA officials said they intend to develop foundational documents for review by the CHIP-IN steering committee\u2014such as a program plan containing objectives\u2014but they have not done so yet. Without clear, measurable objectives, stakeholders within VA may have different understandings of the pilot's purpose and intended outcomes.

VA officials said they intend to develop foundational documents for review by the CHIP-IN steering committee\u2014such as a program plan containing objectives\u2014but they have not done so yet. Without clear, measurable objectives, stakeholders within VA may have different understandings of the pilot's purpose and intended outcomes. As a result, the agency risks pursuing projects that may not contribute to what VA hopes to learn or gain from the pilot. VA officials said they are now following project management principles in implementing the pilot, but they have not yet fully developed and documented either an assessment methodology and evaluation plan, or documented how they will make decisions about scalability of the pilot program. Without clear, measurable objectives, VA may miss opportunities to gather this information from the pilot. For example, while some stakeholders are documenting lessons learned relevant to their roles in the pilot, others are not. Unless VA establishes a clear assessment methodology that articulates responsibilities for contributing and documenting lessons learned, VA may miss opportunities to gather this information from the pilot. For example, while some stakeholders are documenting lessons learned relevant to their roles in the pilot, others are not. Without an assessment methodology, there may also be confusion about who is responsible for documenting lessons learned. Waiting to develop an evaluation plan\u2014which should include details about how lessons learned will be used to measure the pilot's performance\u2014may ultimately affect VA's preparedness to evaluate the pilot and provide information to Congress about its results. VA officials said they are considering scalability in terms of whether the CHIP-IN donation approach is an effective or feasible way of delivering VA projects. However, plans for assessing scalability have not been fully defined and documented. Without clear, measurable objectives, VA may be limited in its ability to communicate quality information about the achievement of its objectives. VA officials said they have begun to implement this practice, with generally successful communication with the Omaha donor group. However, VA officials have experienced some external and internal communication challenges about the pilot, including some challenges communicating pilot requirements to external entities that are interested in the pilot. VA officials said they have taken steps to address some of these challenges. For example, VA officials said they have changed their outreach efforts to focus on certain potential CHIP-IN locations, rather than focusing on a broader audience. VA officials said that the CHIP-IN donation approach can result in potential cost and time savings\u2014through the leveraging of private-sector funding, contracting, and construction practices\u2014according to VA officials and the Omaha donor group. However, VA officials said that a main challenge to establishing the pilot is the reliance on large philanthropic donations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-654": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a national security interest in preventing conflict and stabilizing areas affected by instability and violent conflicts. The SAR, a joint review of U.S. stabilization efforts, recommended that State, USAID, and DOD clarify their respective roles and responsibilities for conducting U.S. stabilization efforts abroad. GAO was asked to review U.S. government efforts to address conflict abroad. This report (1) describes examples of conflict prevention, mitigation, and stabilization efforts conducted in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria and their goals in fiscal year 2017 and (2) examines the extent to which U.S. agencies and USIP incorporated key collaboration practices to coordinate their efforts. GAO reviewed agency and USIP documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed the SAR and interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found The Departments of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense (DOD) reported that they have conducted a variety of efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria aimed at preventing and mitigating violent conflicts and stabilizing areas affected by such conflicts. In response to GAO's request, each agency and USIP provided descriptions and goals for their specific program-level or project-level efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria (and in neighboring countries for Syria). To identify these efforts, each agency and USIP used its own terminology and definitions that were in place in fiscal year 2017. Efforts reported by State as active in fiscal year 2017. State, USAID, DOD, and USIP reported that they sometimes conducted these efforts through grants to implementing partners or through interagency agreements with USIP. For Iraq, State reported a list of three individual efforts and four categories of other efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. These efforts included antiterrorism training and equipment for law enforcement; promotion of democratic governance and protection of basic human rights; support for religious and ethnic minority groups, internally displaced persons, and returnees; and clearance of explosive hazards. These efforts were intended to help defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and transnational terror groups, improve governance and rule of law, and promote reconciliation and the safe return of displaced Iraqis. For Nigeria, State reported 21 efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. USAID reported that it conducted a range of ongoing conflict mitigation and stabilization efforts to address violent conflict in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria, in fiscal year 2017. USAID reported that it conducted a variety of ongoing country-specific efforts including working with youth to develop countering violent extremism action plans, building the capacity of civil society organizations and religious leaders, and providing education for internally displaced children. For Syria, State reported nine efforts as active in fiscal year 2017. State, USAID, DOD, and USIP have incorporated aspects of key collaboration practices to coordinate their conflict prevention, mitigation, and stabilization efforts for Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria. However, the agencies have not documented their agreement on coordination for stabilization efforts in conflict-affected areas through formal written guidance and agreements that address key collaboration practices. The agencies have individually and jointly established some common outcomes for stabilization efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria. Additionally, State, USAID, DOD, and USIP have generally taken steps to bridge their organizational cultures; identify sources of leadership that facilitate coordination; establish roles and responsibilities; and include relevant participants for their conflict prevention, mitigation, and stabilization efforts in these countries. During the course of GAO's review, State, USAID, and DOD released the SAR, which identified areas where U.S. government coordination for stabilization efforts in conflict-affected areas could be improved; however, the agencies have not documented their agreement as to how they will coordinate these efforts in formal written guidance and agreements that address key collaboration practices. Because multiple federal entities are engaged in U.S. conflict prevention, mitigation, and stabilization efforts in Iraq, Nigeria, and Syria, there is some inherent fragmentation in their efforts as well as the potential for overlap and duplication. According to key practices for enhancing interagency collaboration, articulating interagency agreement on collaborative efforts in formal documents, such as a memorandum of agreement or an implementation plan, can strengthen those collaborative efforts and could reduce the potential for unnecessary fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State, USAID, and DOD document their agreement on coordination for U.S. stabilization efforts through formal written guidance and agreements that address key collaboration practices. State, USAID, and DOD concurred with the recommendations and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-16": "Why GAO Did This Study The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing vessel safety laws and regulations. The Coast Guard has not issued regulations or guidance on the alternative-to-class approach, which is a less-prescriptive option for smaller vessels. GAO was asked to review the costs and benefits of classing commercial fishing vessels. This report examines (1) what is known about the numbers and rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities; (2) what is known about the costs to construct and maintain classed commercial fishing vessels built since July 2013 and the effects of classing on vessel builders and owners; (3) the benefits associated with classing commercial fishing vessels; and (4) how the alternative-to-class approach compares with building and maintaining commercial fishing vessels to classification society standards. GAO analyzed Coast Guard data on commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities from 2006 through 2015; reviewed relevant laws and regulations; and interviewed Coast Guard, NIOSH, and NIOSH officials. What GAO Found The number of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities varied from 2006 to 2015, but rates cannot be determined. The Coast Guard investigated 2,101 commercial fishing vessel accidents between 2006 and 2015 that were identified as occurring in federal waters. While the number of accidents in 2015 was greater than the number reported in 2006, the number of injuries and fatalities declined over the same 10-year period. GAO could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery due to limitations with the Coast Guard's data. In addition, GAO was unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities because reliable data on certain information needed to do so\u2014including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates\u2014are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Establishing a mechanism\u2014such as a working group\u2014to coordinate efforts and collect reliable data on the number of active vessels and key characteristics, such as vessel age and length, would allow the agencies to do so in an efficient manner. The Coast Guard and other federal agencies do not collect data on the total number of vessels that are actively fishing\u2014those that are operating, landing, and selling catch\u2014and GAO found that existing data on the population of commercial fishing vessels are not sufficiently reliable to calculate rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Federal internal control standards establish that management should obtain relevant, accurate data from reliable sources in a timely manner, and recommend that agencies' management use quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate the entity's performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks.

    "gao_GAO-17-802T": "Why GAO Did This Study Lifeline provides telephone and broadband service to low-income Americans. Lifeline subscribers pay a subsidy to help them pay for telephone service, and the program is administered by FCC. In May 2017, GAO reported that Lifeline's structure and structure were ineffective in ensuring the availability of telephone service for low-income Americans. GAO recommended that FCC evaluate Lifeline's effectiveness in meeting program goals. This testimony discusses (1) FCC's evaluation of Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals, (2) FCC's financial controls for Lifeline, and (3) FCC's oversight of Lifeline providers. This statement is based on GAO's May 2017 report, Lifeline: Financial Controls Needed to Address Controls and Integrity Risks, GAO-17-177, and May 2017 report, Lifeline: Financial Controls Needed to Address Controls and Integrity Risks, GAO-17-177. What GAO Found The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals but has taken recent steps toward evaluation. In the past, FCC has called for program evaluations to review the administration of universal service generally, including Lifeline, but has not completed such evaluations. In March 2015, GAO found that FCC had not evaluated Lifeline's effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the Universal Service Fund (USF). GAO recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. GAO also found that FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline's performance in meeting program goals. For example, in the 2016 Lifeline Modernization Order, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline's design, function, and administration. The order stipulated the outside evaluator must complete the evaluation and USAC must submit the findings to FCC by December 2020. As FCC expects Lifeline enrollment to increase as the program is expanded to include broadband service, this expansion could carry with it increased risks for fraud, waste, and abuse, as was the case with past expansions of the program. Completing the program evaluation as planned, and as GAO recommended in 2015, would help FCC determine whether Lifeline is meeting its stated goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income consumers, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. FCC and USAC have established financial controls for Lifeline, including obtaining and reviewing information about billing, collecting, and disbursing funds. They have also developed plans to establish other controls, such as establishing a national eligibility verifier (National Verifier) for Lifeline providers to determine the eligibility of applicants seeking Lifeline service. However, as discussed in GAO's May 2017 report, GAO found that weaknesses remain, including the lack of requirements to effectively control program expenditures above approved levels, concerns about the transparency of fees on customers' telephone bills, and a lack of FCC guidance that could result in Lifeline and other providers paying inconsistent USF contributions. To address these concerns, GAO recommended the Chairman of FCC (1) require Commissioners to review and approve, as appropriate, spending above the budget in a timely manner; (2) require a review of customer bills as part of the contribution audit to include an assessment of whether the charges, including USF fees, meet FCC Truth-in-billing rules with regard to labeling so customer bills are transparent and appropriately labeled and described, to help consumers detect and prevent unauthorized changes; and (3) respond to USAC requests for guidance and address pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements to ensure the contribution factor is based on complete information and that USF pass-through charges are equitable. FCC generally agreed with those recommendations. In addition, GAO found that USAC's banking practices for the USF result in oversight and accountability risks that FCC has plans to mitigate. Specifically, FCC maintains USF funds\u2014whose net assets as of September 2016 exceeded $9 billion\u2014outside of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to Office of Management and Budget advice provided in April 2000. However, subsequent to this advice, in February 2005 GAO reported that FCC should reconsider this determination in light of the status of universal service monies as federal funds. FCC has decided to move the funds to the Treasury. FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds to the Treasury, such as better tools for fiscal management of the funds, including access to real-time data and more accurate and transparent data. However, FCC has",
    "gao_GAO-18-367T": "Why GAO Did This Study Railroads are implementing PTC to prevent train-to-train collisions, derailments due to excessive speed, and incursions into work zone limits. Railroads are required to install PTC equipment and train employees to operate PTC. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 requires commuter railroads to implement PTC by December 31, 2018. The act also requires GAO to report on commuter railroads' implementation of PTC. This statement addresses (1) commuter railroads' progress in implementing PTC; how many, if any, commuter railroads may be at risk of not meeting the mandated PTC deadline or certain extension criteria; and what factors may be affecting implementation progress; and (2) the extent to which FRA's management and oversight approach has helped ensure that commuter railroads either meet the deadline or qualify for an extension. This statement is based on GAO's September 2015 report, which examined commuter railroads' implementation of PTC. GAO reviewed FRA's PTC implementation guidance and data, interviewed FRA officials, and analyzed PTC implementation schedules from 29 commuter railroads. What GAO Found Most of the 29 commuter railroads have reported progress in some of the key areas of PTC implementation that FRA monitors, such as locomotive and wayside equipment installation, but the amount of progress reported varies across individual railroads. Over half of the commuter railroads reported that they have made substantial progress in some initial implementation activities, while other railroads reported that they have made much more limited progress or have yet to begin equipment installation or employee training. For example, 18 commuter railroads reported 50 percent or more of their locomotive PTC equipment was installed, and of these, 13 had completed installation. In contrast, 6 railroads reported that they had not started installation of locomotive equipment. Beyond the initial implementation activities, much work remains for the majority of commuter railroads to complete other key PTC activities that will enable them to complete implementation. For example, the majority of commuter railroads reported that they continue to work to complete these steps, which are technically complex and time consuming. Given the variation in commuter railroads' progress, especially related to completing later-stage PTC activities such as testing and developing safety plans, 13 of 29 commuter railroads told GAO they planned to seek a deadline extension, and the remaining 16 told GAO they do not intend to seek an extension. However, the number of commuter railroads planning to seek an extension is subject to change before the end of 2018. GAO's analysis of the implementation schedules of the 29 commuter railroads found that over half may not have sufficient time to complete activities needed to implement PTC by the end of 2018 or to qualify for an extension of that deadline by meeting criteria based on initiating revenue service demonstration (RSD). For example, GAO's analysis found that between 9 and 19 commuter railroads may not have sufficient time to complete RSD activities, and thus may not meet the 2018 PTC deadline or qualify for an RSD-based extension. GAO also found that many factors could affect commuter railroads' planned and future progress, including unexpected setbacks installing PTC components and capacity issues. For example, commuter railroads could face delays due to unexpected issues with PTC components or FRA reviews of documents submitted by the railroads.

    "gao_GAO-18-628": "Why GAO Did This Study Medicaid, the federal government's largest health care program for low-income individuals, provides a wide range of services and supports to help individuals remain in or return to their homes or communities. HCBS include personal care services to provide assistance with activities of daily living (ADL), such as bathing, dressing, toileting, and eating, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), such as preparing meals, housekeeping, using the telephone, and managing money. Medicaid provides states with a number of options for providing HCBS, including through state plan benefits and through waivers and demonstrations. States can choose among delivery systems, such as fee-for-service and MLTSS (i.e., managed care), to provide HCBS. GAO was asked to review the structure of HCBS programs in selected states. This report examines (1) the structure of selected states' HCBS programs and (2) the challenges selected states and MCOs have faced providing HCBS. GAO reviewed 26 HCBS programs in five states selected based on the number of beneficiaries served, the number of beneficiaries served, and the number of beneficiaries served. GAO also interviewed officials from CMS, MCOs, and other stakeholders. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. What GAO Found The structure of the 26 HCBS programs GAO reviewed in selected states reflected decisions about which populations states wanted to cover, whether to limit eligibility for or enrollment in HCBS programs, and whether the state wanted to provide HCBS through managed care (i.e., MLTSS). The structure of the 26 HCBS programs GAO reviewed in selected states reflected decisions about which populations states wanted to cover, whether to limit eligibility for or enrollment in HCBS programs, and whether the state wanted to provide HCBS through managed care (i.e., MLTSS). In two states, settlements resulting from litigation also affected the structure of HCBS programs. Officials from the five selected states and MCOs GAO interviewed described challenges with providing HCBS, including workforce issues, such as recruiting and retaining direct care workers; serving beneficiaries with complex medical or behavioral health needs; and other challenges. The officials also reported taking steps to respond to these challenges. For example, officials from all five selected states and three of the four MCOs GAO interviewed said they have responded to the challenge of serving HCBS beneficiaries with complex medical or behavioral health needs by (1) supporting the development of locations in the community to serve individuals with specific complex needs, (2) training providers, and (3) increasing care coordination. Officials from four selected states and one MCO said that limits on funding for HCBS programs were a challenge, particularly in the context of the growing number of individuals with LTSS needs. Officials from Montana and Mississippi said that the state's Money Follows the Person grant program\u2014which provided state Medicaid programs with funding for beneficiaries to transition out of institutions\u2014had helped them to serve more individuals in home- and community-based settings. Officials from one MCO said that the state's limit on HCBS waiver spending per beneficiary\u2014requiring that spending for HCBS does not exceed the cost of institutional care\u2014was a challenge, particularly for beneficiaries with high needs.

    "gao_GAO-18-431T": "Why GAO Did This Study The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 includes a provision for GAO to testify on the progress made in reforming the personnel security clearance process. This testimony addresses (1) the status of reforms and key initiatives, (2) the timeliness objectives for processing personnel security clearances, and (3) the potential effects of continuous evaluation on executive branch agencies. This statement is based on GAO's December 2017 report, which examined the status of reforms and key initiatives. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from ODNI, OPM, and PAC. What GAO Found The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has made progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process and implementing various security clearance reform initiatives. For example, the PAC has taken action on 73 percent of the recommendations of a February 2014 review conducted in the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shooting. Actions in response to these recommendations included ODNI and OPM jointly issuing Quality Assessment Standards in January 2015, which establish federal guidelines for assessing the quality of investigations. Additionally, ODNI developed the Quality Assessment Reporting Tool, through which agencies will report on the completeness of investigations. Similarly, the PAC reported quarterly on the status and progress of key initiatives, as part of the Insider Threat and Security Clearance Reform cross-agency priority goal. This reporting included the milestone due date and status for each initiative. The PAC has issued three documents that serve as its updated strategic framework for the next 5 years. In July 2016, it issued its Strategic Intent for Fiscal Years 2017 through 2021, which identifies the overall vision, goals, and 5-year business direction to achieve an entrusted workforce. In October 2016, it issued an updated PAC Enterprise IT Strategy, which provides the technical direction to provide mission-capable and secure security, suitability, and credentialing IT systems. In December 2017, PAC members noted additional progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process, such as the development of Security Executive Agent Directives, the identification of executive branch\u2014wide IT shared service capabilities, and the standardization of adjudicative criteria. However, the implementation of certain key initiatives, including the full implementation of the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards and the development of government-wide performance measures for the quality of investigations, remain incomplete. The original milestone for completing government-wide measures was fiscal year 2010, and no new milestone has been established. GAO's analysis of government-wide and agency-specific data shows a decline in the number of executive branch agencies meeting the timeliness objectives for processing clearances. While ODNI has taken steps to address timeliness challenges, it has not developed a government-wide approach to help agencies improve the timeliness of initial personnel security clearances. Additionally, the backlog of background investigations conducted by the National Bureau of Investigations (NBIB)\u2014the primary entity responsible for conducting background investigations\u2014has steadily increased since 2014 and as of February 2018 exceeds 710,000 cases. NBIB personnel are attempting to decrease the backlog by making the background investigation process more effective and efficient and increasing investigator capacity. However, NBIB faces challenges in developing a plan to reduce the size of the investigation backlog to a manageable level. GAO reported in November 2017 that the potential effects of continuous evaluation on executive branch agencies are unknown because future phases of the program and the effect on agency resources have not yet been determined. ODNI has not yet determined key aspects of its continuous evaluation program, which has limited the ability of executive branch agencies to plan for implementation in accordance with ODNI's phased approach. For example, while ODNI has initiated the first phase of continuous evaluation in coordination with implementing executive branch agencies, it has not yet determined what the future phases of implementation will entail, or when they will occur. As a result, the uncertainty regarding the requirements and time frames for the future phases of the program has affected the ability of executive branch agencies to plan to implement continuous evaluation and estimate the associated costs. What GAO Recommends GAO has made recommendations to ODNI to develop a government-wide plan to improve timeliness or address the backlog of background investigations. ODNI generally concurred with these recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-9": "Why GAO Did This Study DEA has obligated about $56 million through its Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) to support state and local law enforcement agencies' efforts to eradicate and suppress illegal domestic marijuana. GAO was asked to review DEA's oversight of DCE/SP. This report examines (1) the amount of funding DEA obligated to DCE/SP from 2015 through fiscal year 2018, (2) how DEA oversees participating agencies' expenditures of DCE/SP funds, and (3) the extent to which DEA collects and uses information on DCE/SP activities to help manage the program. GAO reviewed DEA data on DCE/SP funds from 2015 through fiscal year 2018, and interviewed DEA officials and officials from participating agencies in six states selected based on their marijuana eradication and suppression efforts. GAO also interviewed DEA officials and contractors in four states selected based on their marijuana eradication and suppression efforts. What GAO Found From 2015 through fiscal year 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) obligated about $17.7 million annually on average to DCE/SP to support participating state and local law enforcement agencies' efforts to eradicate and suppress illegal domestic marijuana. During each year of the 4-year time frame GAO reviewed, DEA obligated most of the DCE/SP funds to support the marijuana eradication efforts of the participating agencies\u2014for example, $14 million of the $18 million in fiscal year 2018 went to 125 participating agencies in 37 states, or approximately $378,000 on average per state. DEA obligated the remaining funds\u2014for example, $4 million in fiscal year 2018\u2014to pay for program support. DEA headquarters officials reported that they obligated funding to participating agencies based on various factors, including the agencies' past performance, their level of matching investment in the program, and the approximate amount of illegal growing in an area.

DEA headquarters officials reported that they obligated funding to participating agencies based on various factors, including the agencies' past performance, their level of matching investment in the program, and the approximate amount of illegal growing in an area. DEA oversees participating agencies' expenditures of DCE/SP funds in various ways to help ensure compliance with program requirements, including providing guidance, pre-approving purchases, conducting on-site observations, and reviewing information on participating agencies' expenditures. However, DEA does not consistently collect supporting documentation from participating agencies regarding their reported DCE/SP expenditures. DEA officials said that they expect regional contractors to collect supporting documentation for aviation support and overtime expenses when participating agencies submit their end-of-year quarterly expenditure reports. However, it is GAO's assessment that this expectation differs from DEA's written requirement because the requirement does not include supporting documentation for overtime expenses. By developing and implementing a plan with specific actions and time frames to ensure that regional contractors are implementing DEA's requirement for collecting supporting documentation in the intended manner, DEA could have greater assurance that program funds are being expended appropriately. DEA collects and uses information on DCE/SP activities to help manage the program, but should strengthen data reliability, clearly document program goals, and establish measures to assess program performance. GAO found that participating agencies have practices for reporting information on some of their marijuana eradication and suppression activities that differ from DEA's written guidance. Moreover, GAO found that stakeholders at all levels\u2014participating agencies as well as DEA field and headquarters officials\u2014had varying understandings of what participating agencies are required to report to DEA for DCE/SP. As a result, the information DEA collects is not fully reliable for the purpose of assessing program performance. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DEA develop and implement a plan with specific actions and time frames to ensure that regional contractors are implementing DEA's requirement for collecting supporting documentation in the intended manner. DEA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",

This statement discusses (1) the proposed restructuring of the immigration court system, and (2) the extent to which the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) has taken actions to improve its management of the immigration courts. This statement is based on GAO's June 2017 report, Immigration Courts: EOIR Has Initiated Actions to Address Long-standing Challenges, but Additional Steps Are Needed to Address Long-Status Challenges, GAO-17-78. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed 10 experts and stakeholders from EOIR, including officials from the agency, the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). What GAO Found As GAO reported in June 2017, some immigration court experts and stakeholders have recommended restructuring EOIR's administrative review and appeals functions within the immigration court system\u2014immigration courts and the Bureau of Immigration and Appeals (BIA)\u2014and the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the system or, among other things, increase the perceived independence of the system and professionalism and credibility of the workforce. GAO found that the 10 experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed generally supported one of the following scenarios for restructuring the immigration court system, all of which would require a statutory change to implement: a court system independent (i.e., outside) of the executive branch to replace EOIR's immigration court system, including both trial and appellate tribunals; a new, independent administrative agency within the executive branch to carry out EOIR's quasi-judicial functions with both trial-level immigration judges and an appellate level review board; or a hybrid approach, placing trial-level immigration judges in an independent administrative agency within the executive branch, and an appellate-level tribunal outside of the executive branch.

GAO also found that the 10 experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed cited several reasons for each of the proposed scenarios, such as potentially increasing judicial autonomy over courtrooms and dockets; as well as provided reasons against restructuring options, such as that restructuring may not resolve existing management challenges. GAO also reported in June 2017 that EOIR could take several actions to address long-standing management and operational challenges and reduce the case backlog. In particular, GAO identified challenges related to, and made 11 recommendations to improve, EOIR's workforce planning, hiring, performance assessment, and technology utilization.

    "gao_GAO-18-421": "Why GAO Did This Study SBA's 7(a) program guarantees loans to small businesses for working capital and other general business purposes. The 7(a) program is required to serve borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms. SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to make credit elsewhere determinations. GAO was asked to review SBA's 7(a) program. This report examines (1) 7(a) lending to selected categories of small business borrowers from fiscal years 2007 through 2016; (2) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement; (3) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement; and (4) lenders' views on the criteria used to determine eligibility for 7(a) loans and other issues related to the 7(a) program. GAO analyzed SBA data on 7(a) loans and borrowers from fiscal years 2007 through 2016; reviewed SBA's lender reviews; and interviewed SBA officials and representatives from 11 lenders. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, a majority of 7(a) loans went to small businesses that were new, partially or wholly owned by women, or located in a distressed area. The remaining 37 percent of 7(a) loan dollars went to businesses that were established, solely male-owned, and not located in economically distressed areas. SBA relies on on-site reviews as its primary mechanism for evaluating lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. SBA's standard operating procedures state that lenders must substantiate that credit is not available elsewhere by (1) discussing the criteria that demonstrate an identifiable weakness in a borrower's credit and (2) including the specific reasons why the borrower does not meet the lender's conventional loan policy requirements. SBA's contractors and SBA staff who conduct on-site reviews are supposed to assess whether lenders have adequately documented the credit elsewhere criteria and provided specific reasons supporting the criteria in the credit memorandum. SBA's contractors said adequate documentation of the credit elsewhere determination in the credit memorandum would include not just which of the criteria a borrower met but also a discussion of the basis or justification for the decision. SBA's contractors also told GAO that they carefully review a lender's loan policies in preparation for on-site reviews and refer to a lender's policies throughout the reviews. Reviewers do not attempt to verify the evidence given in support of the credit elsewhere reason beyond the information provided in the credit memorandum. SBA's reviews in fiscal year 2016 identified a high rate of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. The key factors underlying lenders' high rate of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement were lenders' lack of proper internal controls and procedures and lack of awareness of the credit elsewhere requirement. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including appropriate documentation of transactions and internal control. Because SBA does not require reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and practices for complying with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, the agency does not have good information to help explain why so many lenders are not in compliance. This hinders SBA's ability to take informed and effective actions to improve lender compliance with the requirement and ensure that the 7(a) program is reaching its intended population. SBA does not routinely collect information on the criteria lenders use in their credit elsewhere justifications. SBA does not routinely collect information on the criteria lenders use in their credit elsewhere justifications. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including appropriate documentation of transactions and internal control. SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria lenders use in their credit elsewhere justifications to evaluate patterns in lender practices. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and whether 7(a) loans are reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that SBA (1) require reviewers to document their assessments of lenders' policies and practices for complying with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement; (2) analyze information on lenders' use of the credit elsewhere criteria obtained from its reviews to identify lenders that may be at greater risk of noncompliance and to inform its selection of lenders for further review for credit elsewhere compliance; and (3) analyze information on lenders' use of the credit elsewhere criteria obtained from its reviews to identify lenders that may be at greater risk of noncompliance and to inform its selection of lenders",
    "gao_GAO-19-81": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has a long-standing interest in resolving international tax disputes. In the United States, the U.S. Competent Authority (USCA) is the agency responsible for resolving disputes over double taxation. USCA is responsible for resolving disputes over the adjustment of U.S. corporations' foreign income. GAO was asked to review the MAP process. This report examines (1) the extent to which USCA evaluates the management of MAP cases, and (2) the extent to which APMA tracks and analyzes data on MAP cases. GAO reviewed IRS documents and data on MAP cases, and interviewed IRS officials. GAO also analyzed a generalizable sample of MAP case files from a generalizable random sample of 84 cases. What GAO Found USCA provides information about the Advanced Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program (MAP) process through an IRS web page on competent authority assistance. However, the information on the website is highly technical and may not be easily understood by taxpayers seeking relief from double taxation. USCA officials said that they are engaged in some efforts that may improve the information they provide to taxpayers. USCA does not track key data or use existing data to assess the management of MAP cases. For example, USCA does not track the hours that analysts spend on cases and the milestones of cases. As a result, USCA does not have a full understanding of the efficiency of the MAP process, including ways to improve it. It also does not have processes to ensure the quality of the data it collects, therefore cannot ensure accurate performance measurement. APMA's inventory data-base includes data on both pending and resolved MAP cases that can help management monitor program operations and potentially identify areas to improve the management of MAP cases. However, APMA does not systematically analyze data to identify areas for improvement. For example, analysis of trends and comparisons of certain case characteristics\u2014such as the country initiating the adjustment, the elapsed time on the case, whether an economist was assigned to the case, and the negotiated outcome\u2014can help to identify how these characteristics may be related. According to APMA officials, they do not undertake this kind of data analysis because they use the data as needed to manage current resources and to achieve their primary goal of satisfying the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) minimum standards. Analyzing trends in case characteristics could help to identify areas for improvement. APMA does not track the tax issue that was in dispute. Without tracking the tax issue in dispute, APMA is unable to analyze trends in tax issues which could be used to determine if there are systemic issues that could be solved through means such as changes in IRS regulations, treaty, or statute. Conducting similar reviews of this type of information could help APMA better match its resources in terms of experience with different types of tax issues within its country-focused teams. Conducting similar reviews across tax issues may help identify areas for increased scrutiny to ensure effective administration. Collecting key characteristics and conducting relevant analyses would help ensure effective internal control and could help improve USCA's management of MAP cases. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that USCA provide an overview of the MAP process that is more accessible and transparent than the Revenue Procedure. USCA agreed with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-222": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government has a long-standing interest in accelerating the delivery of highway and transit projects. In the past, Congress has enacted legislation that includes provisions intended to accelerate the delivery of such projects. GAO was asked to review the project delivery provisions. This report (1) identifies the provisions aimed at accelerating the delivery of highway and transit projects that were included in the last three surface transportation reauthorizations; (2) examines the extent to which the provisions were used by state departments of transportation (state DOT) and transit agencies and the provisions' reported effects, if any, on accelerating the delivery of projects; and (3) evaluates the extent to which DOT has assigned NEPA authority to states and the reported effects. GAO surveyed state DOTs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and interviewed officials from FHWA and FTA. What GAO Found GAO identified 34 project delivery provisions that apply to highway projects and 29 such provisions that apply to transit projects. These provisions are intended to streamline various aspects of the NEPA process, making it more efficient and timely. Most of the provisions apply to both types of projects. For example, the Accelerated NEPA Review provision generally establishes certain conditions that permit projects, if the specific conditions are applicable, to exclude certain actions from a more detailed NEPA review. For example, the Minor Impacts to Protected Public Land provision authorizes a historic site, parkland, or refuge to be used for a transportation project if that project is determined to have a de minimis impact on the environment. The Administrative and Coordination Changes provision establishes time frames for parts of the NEPA review process, encourages the use of planning documents and programmatic plans as well as a coordination plan for public and federal agency participation in the environmental review process, and seeks to avoid duplication in NEPA review documents. The NEPA Assignment Authority provision authorizes the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to assign federal NEPA authority to states for approving environmental impact statements (EIS), environmental assessments, and categorical exclusions. FHWA and FTA are the federal agencies responsible for ensuring NEPA compliance on highway and transit projects. FHWA and FTA are required to assign NEPA authority to states if certain requirements are met.

    "gao_GAO-19-164": "Why GAO Did This Study FEMA is responsible for providing disaster relief and emergency response assistance to the public. FEMA has identified 10 primary legacy IT systems that support its grants management activities. FEMA initiated GMM in 2015, in part, due to the agency's failed attempt to modernize its grants management environment. GAO was asked to review FEMA's grants management processes. This report examines the extent to which (1) FEMA is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management business processes and incorporating business needs into GMM requirements; (2) the program's estimated costs and schedule; and (3) FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices for GMM. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed FEMA officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and DHS guidance. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has implemented most leading practices for reengineering its grants management business processes and incorporating business needs into GMM requirements. For example, FEMA has taken steps to assess and document its business environment and performance goals, defined initial IT requirements for GMM, took recent actions to better track progress in delivering planned IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, the agency has not finalized plans or established time frames for implementing its organizational change management actions, plans and communicates system transition activities, and maintains clear traceability of IT requirements. Until FEMA finalizes plans and time frames for implementing its organizational change management actions, plans and communicates system transition activities, and maintains clear traceability of IT requirements, FEMA will be limited in its ability to provide streamlined grants management processes and effectively deliver a modernized IT system to meet the needs of its large range of users. GMM's initial cost estimate was reliable, but key assumptions about the program changed soon after DHS approved the estimate in May 2017. Thus, the initial cost estimate no longer reflects the current approach for the program. The forthcoming updated cost schedule is expected to better reflect the current approach. However, the program's unreliable schedule to fully deliver GMM by September 2020 is aggressive and unrealistic. The delays the program has experienced to date further compound GMM's schedule issues. Without a robust schedule that has been informed by a realistic assessment of GMM's development activities, leadership will be limited in its ability to make informed decisions on what additional increases in cost or reductions in scope might be needed to achieve their goals. FEMA's implementation of cybersecurity practices for GMM in the areas of system categorization, selection and implementation, and monitoring will help the program. However, GMM lacked essential details for evaluating security controls, did not approve the security assessment plan before proceeding with the security assessment, did not follow DHS's guidance to develop corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, and did not fully test all security controls. As a result, the GMM engineering and test environment remains at an increased risk of exploitations. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FEMA finalizes its organizational change management plan and time frames for implementing change management actions, and that FEMA update the GMM program schedule to address leading practices for a reliable schedule. DHS concurred with all eight recommendations and provided estimated completion dates for implementing each.",
    "gao_GAO-18-565": "Why GAO Did This Study The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires the exchanges to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured and underinsured consumers. The exchanges are funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and are designed to provide consumers with access to health insurance coverage through the exchanges. HHS also provides financial assistance to navigator organizations that provide in-person consumer enrollment assistance. GAO was asked to review the 2018 open enrollment period. This report examines (1) the extent to which enrollment through the exchanges changed from 2017 to 2018 and the factors that affected enrollment, and (2) the extent to which HHS allocated navigator funding for the 2018 open enrollment period. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, and interviewed HHS officials and 23 stakeholders, including navigator organizations, state insurance departments, and professional trade associations. What GAO Found Enrollment through the health insurance exchanges was 5 percent lower in 2018 than 2017\u2014the most recent year for which data were available. About 8.7 million consumers enrolled in health insurance exchanges during the open enrollment period for 2018 coverage, 5 percent less than the 9.2 million who enrolled for 2017. This decline continues a trend from 2016, when a peak of 9.6 million consumers enrolled in such plans. Since that peak, enrollment has decreased by 9 percent. Stakeholders GAO interviewed reported that plan affordability likely played a major role in 2018 exchange enrollment\u2014both attracting and detracting from enrollment\u2014and enrollees' plan selection. In 2018, premiums across all health insurance plans increased an average of 30 percent\u2014more than expected given overall health cost trends. As a result of these premium increases, plans were less affordable in 2018 compared to 2017 for exchange consumers without advance premium tax credits (15 percent in 2018). One driver of these premium increases was the elimination of federal cost-sharing reduction payments to issuers in late 2017, which resulted in larger premium increases for silver tier plans (the most popular healthcare.gov metal tier). Stakeholders GAO interviewed reported that a variety of other factors likely affected 2018 exchange enrollment, but opinions on the impact of each factor were mixed. For example, most stakeholders GAO interviewed, including all 4 navigator organizations and 3 professional trade organizations, reported that consumer confusion about PPACA and its status likely played a major role in detracting from 2018 enrollment.

    "gao_GAO-18-637": "Why GAO Did This Study The LIHTC program provides tax credits to developers of affordable housing projects. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administers the program and oversees allocating agencies. GAO was asked to review LIHTC development costs. This report examines (1) the costs of LIHTC projects completed in 2011\u20132015, (2) how allocating agencies manage and verify LIHTC development costs, and (3) the extent to which allocating agencies collect and maintain data related to LIHTC project costs. GAO analyzed LIHTC project costs from 12 allocating agencies, selected based on geographic location, number of units, and number of bedrooms. GAO also interviewed IRS and Treasury officials and industry stakeholders. What GAO Found The median per-unit cost of the LIHTC projects completed in GAO's sample in 2011\u20132015 was $204,000. The median per-unit cost of new construction projects was about $50,000 higher than for rehabilitation projects ($218,000 compared to $169,000). For new construction projects, the median per-unit cost was about $38,000 higher in urban areas than in nonurban areas (about $230,000 compared to $192,000). For rehabilitation projects, the median per-unit cost was about $72,000 higher in urban areas than in nonurban areas (about $196,000 compared to $124,000). The median per-unit cost of new construction projects was about $147,000 for new construction projects (about 67 percent of the total development cost) and $103,000 for rehabilitation projects (about 61 percent of the total development cost). Other funding sources, such as private loans or state and local programs, made up for differences between project costs and equity investments. GAO's analysis of the cost of LIHTC projects completed in 2011\u20132015 found that the median per-unit cost of new construction projects was about $204,000. The median per-unit cost of rehabilitation projects was about $226,000 in 2015 dollars. The median per-unit cost of new construction projects across the 12 selected allocating agencies ranged from a low of about $126,000 in Texas to a high of $326,000 in California. The median per-unit cost of rehabilitation projects was lower and varied less than those for new construction projects. The characteristics of each agency's LIHTC projects generally can be expected to reflect the real estate conditions, built environment, and populations of the areas they serve. Allocating agencies took steps to manage and verify LIHTC development costs, but IRS policies do not require detailed cost information. Allocating agencies used approaches that included cost and fee limits and cost-based scoring criteria to manage project-development costs. A few agencies adopted additional measures such as detailed contractor certifications at project completion to help guard against a risk of fraud involving misrepresentation of contractor costs, but LIHTC policies do not require these enhancements. Data limitations, including inconsistencies among allocating agencies in the collection, definition, and format of key variables, constrain analysis and oversight of LIHTC development costs. IRS does not specifically require allocating agencies to collect and report cost-related data that would facilitate programwide assessment of development costs. IRS officials said that doing so would be inconsistent with their authority and role, which is focused on taxpayer compliance rather than program evaluation. As a result, allocating agencies have flexibility in what cost-related data to collect, how to maintain these data, and how to define variables for purposes of program evaluation. GAO's tax expenditure evaluation guide suggests federal agencies assess (determine and define) what data are needed to evaluate tax expenditures. Without standardized, accessible data on LIHTC development costs, federal agencies and credit allocating agencies cannot rigorously assess the factors that drive costs, the reasonableness of costs, and the efficiency of LIHTCs in producing affordable housing. Currently, no standards exist for collecting and maintaining data related to LIHTC project costs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS require general contractor cost certifications for LIHTC projects, and that IRS communicate to allocating agencies how to collect and review information on LIHTC syndication expenses, including upper-tier partnership expenses. IRS disagreed with GAO's recommendation to require cost certifications for LIHTC projects, but said it was not clear whether the recommendation would uncover and deter misrepresentation of contractor costs. GAO maintains that requiring general contractor cost certifications would help address this fraud risk by providing greater cost transparency to allocating agencies and auditors.",
    "gao_GAO-18-44": "Why GAO Did This Study The opioid epidemic has grown significantly in recent years, and the number of people who use opioids has increased. HHS has implemented five key efforts from 2015 through August 2017 that focus on expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders. GAO was asked to review HHS's efforts to expand access to MAT for opioid use disorders. This report examines (1) HHS's efforts to expand access to MAT for opioid use disorders and (2) the extent to which HHS has established performance measures with targets and timeframes for its evaluation of its efforts. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, HHS documents, and other documents; interviewed HHS officials and stakeholders; and analyzed HHS data on the number of prescriptions for MAT and the treatment capacity of practitioners who are authorized to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorders. What GAO Found The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has implemented five key efforts from 2015 through August 2017 that focus on expanding access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders. Four of these are grant programs, including programs focused on health centers or primary care practices in rural areas. HHS's fifth effort increases treatment capacity by expanding the waivers that practitioners may receive to prescribe buprenorphine. Specifically, the new regulation became effective August 8, 2016 increasing the number of patients that eligible practitioners can treat with buprenorphine outside of an opioid treatment program (OTP) (e.g., in an office-based setting). Previously, qualified practitioners could request approval to treat up to 30 patients at a time, and after 1 year the limit could increase to 100 patients at a time upon SAMHSA approval. The new regulation expanded access to MAT by allowing eligible practitioners who have had waivers to prescribe buprenorphine to 100 patients for at least 1 year to request approval to treat up to 275 patients thereafter. HHS officials told GAO that as of August 2017, the department is in the process of finalizing its approach for evaluating the implementation of its agencies' collective efforts to address the opioid epidemic that were undertaken as part of the HHS Opioid Initiative and will continue under the new administration's Opioid Strategy. HHS officials told GAO that the evaluation will focus initially on whether HHS's efforts have been implemented as intended, and officials expect the evaluation to also provide information on any challenges HHS has faced in implementing these efforts. HHS officials told GAO that in the future an evaluation may also focus on the effectiveness of these efforts, including the effectiveness of efforts to expand access to MAT. Doing so would be consistent with federal standards for internal control, which call for agencies to evaluate results. HHS has some of the information that could be used in a future evaluation of the effectiveness of its efforts to expand access to MAT. For example, HHS has identified three potential ways to measure access to MAT: the number of prescriptions for MAT medications, the treatment capacity of practitioners who are authorized to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorders through a Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 waiver, and the treatment capacity of OTPs certified to administer methadone and other medications. However, HHS has not adopted specific performance measures with targets specifying the magnitude of the increases HHS hopes to achieve through its efforts to expand access to MAT, and by when. For example, HHS has not established a long-term target specifying the percentage increase in the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine HHS would like to achieve, which would help to show whether efforts by HHS and others are resulting in sufficient progress in increasing prescriptions for this MAT medication. HHS has not chosen a specific method of measuring treatment capacity or established targets associated with it, which would help to show whether a sufficient number of providers are becoming available to evaluate and treat patients who may benefit from MAT. Without performance measures with targets and evaluation timeframes, HHS increases the risk that the evaluation will not be completed in a timely manner or that HHS will not know whether its MAT-related efforts are successful or whether new approaches are needed. The evaluation is particularly important, given the hundreds of millions of dollars HHS has invested in its MAT-related grant programs. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HHS establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders and establish timeframes in its evaluation approach that specify when its evaluation of efforts to expand access to MAT will be implemented and completed. HHS concurred with both recommendations.",

    "gao_GAO-18-602": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) provides retiree health benefits to about 500,000 postal retirees. The RHB Fund is the initial funding source for USPS's share of retiree health benefits. The fund is projected to be depleted in 12 years under the status quo. GAO was asked to review the financial outlook of the RHB Fund. This report examines (1) the financial outlook of the RHB Fund and (2) potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and reports; analyzed data on the number of companies offering retiree health benefits; and interviewed officials from OPM, USPS, and companies that have retained their retiree health benefits. What GAO Found The financial outlook for the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHB Fund) is poor as USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund's balance is declining. Beginning in fiscal year 2017, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) started drawing from the fund to pay USPS's share of premiums for postal retirees' health benefits. OPM's payments in that year exceeded the fund's income from interest, and OPM projects that, based on the status quo, future payments will continue to exceed the fund's income from interest. As long as USPS continues to miss its annual payments--which were nearly $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 and are $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2018--the fund is on track to be depleted in fiscal year 2030 based on OPM projections requested by GAO. GAO's analysis of past practices and USPS statements suggests that USPS will not be able to fill the financial gap once the RHB Fund is depleted. There is no certainty on what actions should be taken to address this problem. However, GAO has identified multiple approaches that could be used, individually or in combination, that Congress could consider to help address the financial shortfall in this area. All of these approaches have different potential effects, and it is up to Congress to consider the merits of the approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. It would be preferable to take action when careful consideration is possible, rather than wait until lack of adequate funding could disrupt postal retiree health benefits. What GAO Recommends Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. USPS concurred with GAO's matter for congressional consideration. However, USPS said GAO's discussion of potential policy approaches for postal retiree health benefits would benefit from additional context and balance. USPS also put forth additional information for three of the potential policy approaches highlighted in GAO's report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-29": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is required to grant security clearances to individuals who require access to classified information. The IRTPA, which was enacted in 2014, established the PAC and NBIB to improve the personnel security clearance process government-wide. GAO was asked to review the reform effort. This report examines (1) the status of reform efforts, (2) the extent to which executive branch agencies have met timeliness objectives for initial investigations and adjudications, and (3) the extent to which NBIB has taken steps to improve the background investigation process. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from the PAC, OPM, and DOD. What GAO Found Executive branch agencies have made progress in reforming the personnel security clearance process government-wide, but long-standing key initiatives remain incomplete. Executive branch agencies have issued guidance, updated strategic documents, and adjudicative guidelines to establish single, common adjudicative criteria for security clearances. However, implementing certain aspects of the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards, including changing the frequency of periodic reinvestigations for certain clearance holders and establishing a continuous evaluation program, remain incomplete. In addition, the issuance of a reciprocity policy remains incomplete. While the executive branch has taken steps toward establishing performance measures for the quality of government-wide personnel security clearance investigations, there is no milestone for their completion. Executive branch agencies have experienced challenges in meeting timeliness objectives for investigation and adjudication of initial personnel security clearances, and their reporting on timeliness has been limited. The number of executive branch agencies meeting established timeliness objectives for both initial secret and initial top secret clearances decreased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. While the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has taken steps to address timeliness challenges, it has not developed a government-wide approach to help agencies improve the timeliness of initial personnel security clearances. In addition, the executive branch's reporting on timeliness has been limited, which inhibits both transparency and oversight of the personnel security clearance process. The transition from the Federal Investigation Service (FIS) to the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) has involved organizational changes intended to improve the background investigation process, but the bureau faces operational challenges in addressing the investigation backlog and associated workforce planning. NBIB's organizational changes include the creation of some new departments, and DOD is now responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining a new information technology (IT) system for the bureau, but must contend with risks posed by vulnerabilities in OPM's legacy IT systems, which NBIB still utilizes. As NBIB transitions, it has taken steps to improve its oversight of background investigation contracts and measure the completeness of background investigations; however, it faces operational challenges in developing a plan to reduce the size of the investigation backlog and in ensuring that its overall workforce is sized and structured to meet its mission. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Director of National Intelligence, in his capacity as Security Executive Agent, develop, implement, and report to Congress on government-wide, results-oriented performance measures for the quality of background investigations. ODNI did not state whether it concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-226": "Why GAO Did This Study Indian students attend public schools in both urban and rural areas. In school year 2015-16, approximately 505,000 Indian students attended public schools, representing 1 percent of all public school students. In addition, approximately 45,000 attended Bureau of Indian Education schools, which serve mostly low-income students. GAO was asked to examine the public school choice options available to Indian students. This report examines the public school choice options located in areas with large populations of American Indian and Alaska Native students, collectively referred to as Indian students. GAO analyzed Education data for school year 2015-16, focusing on: (1) school districts with high percentages of Indian students and school options; and (2) the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students. GAO analyzed Education data for school year 2015-16, focusing on: (1) school districts with high percentages of Indian students and school options; (2) the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students; and (3) Indian student enrollment in public school options. GAO analyzed Education data for school year 2015-16, focusing on: (1) school districts with high percentages of Indian students and school options; (2) the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students; and (3) Indian student enrollment in public school options. GAO analyzed Education data for school year 2015-16, focusing on: (1) school districts with high percentages of Indian students and school options; (2) the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students; and (3) Indian student enrollment in public school options. GAO analyzed Education data for school year 2015-16, focusing on: (1) school districts with high percentages of Indian students and school options; (2) the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students; and (3) Indian student enrollment in public school options. GAO also interviewed federal officials and academic subject matter experts. What GAO Found Few areas with high percentages of Indian students had options other than traditional public schools, according to GAO's analysis of Education data for school year 2015-16. Of the 451 school districts with high percentages of Indian students in GAO's analysis, 84 percent (378 districts) had only traditional public schools. The remaining 16 percent (73 districts) had at least one Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) school, charter school, magnet school, or career and technical education (CTE) school. The most common option was a BIE school. Among districts that had only traditional public schools, about three-quarters of them had more than one school. The presence of a school choice option or more than one traditional school in a given location does not mean that a given school is necessarily available to all Indian students in the area. This may be because of school-level factors such as enrollment caps, eligibility requirements, or grade levels offered, and environmental factors, such as limited transportation options. GAO also analyzed Education data from the 100 school districts with the largest number of Indian students. Some of these districts were located in large urban areas and a majority had at least one other option in addition to traditional public schools. Of these 100 districts, 62 offered at least one option other than a traditional public school, with the most common option being charter schools. Even when Indian students had more school choice options, there was no consistent enrollment pattern across districts with large numbers of Indian students. In about a quarter of the districts that had at least one charter school, Indian students enrolled in charter schools in similar percentages as non-Indian students. In the remaining districts, enrollment patterns varied. For example, in one school district near Boise, Idaho and another near Fairbanks, Alaska, Indian students attended charter schools at higher percentages than their peers by 60 percentage points and 6 percentage points, respectively. In the remaining districts, Indian students attended magnet schools at lower percentages than non-Indian students. Whether Indian students enrolled in different types of schools could be a function of local differences in school choice and could be influenced by the extent to which these schools offered curricula that reflect Indian languages, cultures, or histories. Experts with whom GAO spoke said that in some areas, tribes have more control over education for Indian students, which can increase the tribe's ability to influence curricula and accountability metrics to help meet Indian students' academic and non-academic needs. Experts further noted that many districts with high percentages of Indian students are located near tribal lands, which can offer Indian students living there greater access to culturally-relevant curricula and instruction in Native languages than their peers in urban areas.",
    "gao_GAO-19-115": "Why GAO Did This Study SNAP is the nation's largest food assistance program for low-income individuals and households. In fiscal year 2017, SNAP provided $2 billion in benefits to about 5.5 million SNAP recipients. GAO was asked to review SNAP recipient fraud. This report examines (1) the extent to which SNAP households in selected states are making out-of-state purchases that may indicate potential recipient fraud; (2) the extent to which selected states are using data analytics\u2014including those applied to out-of-state transactions\u2014to find potential SNAP recipient fraud, and what advantages and challenges, if any, have they experienced doing so, and (3) how FNS has assisted states in implementing leading practices for data analytics for fraud detection. GAO analyzed fiscal year 2017 SNAP transaction data from FNS for all participating households in the three selected states, and interviewed officials from FNS and state SNAP agencies. What GAO Found A relatively large number of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households made out-of-state purchases, as allowed under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) statute, but the total dollar value of out-of-state purchases was small compared to SNAP purchases overall. GAO identified approximately 5.5 million households that made out-of-state SNAP purchases in fiscal year 2017. In comparison, FNS reported that the monthly average number of SNAP households was approximately 21 million in fiscal year 2017. Out-of-state purchases may indicate potential program violations, including eligibility fraud or trafficking. However, because out-of-state purchases are permitted, analysis of additional household and transaction information is generally needed to identify potential fraud. GAO's analysis of fiscal year 2017 transaction data in the three selected states found that SNAP households without out-of-state purchases were generally just as likely to have made the types of purchases that may indicate SNAP recipient fraud as households with out-of-state purchases. GAO found that the analysis of transaction data for other factors may allow states to identify households at risk of trafficking and make them a higher priority for investigation. GAO found out-of-state purchase information alone is of limited benefit to identify SNAP households that may be engaged in trafficking. Some selected states reported using data analytics beyond required data matching and cited advantages as well as organizational and resource challenges. For example, officials in all seven selected states reported conducting additional data analytics beyond data matching, such as conducting data mining to detect and flag transactions that indicate potential recipient fraud. Officials in all seven selected states reported a range of organizational and resource challenges that either prevented them from using more advanced data analytics techniques or made their current data analytics practices difficult to implement. For example, officials in Washington reported that they were unable to quantify the benefits of data analytics because of the challenge of quantifying how often fraud is prevented before it occurs. Officials in Maine reported that they were able to combine data from multiple databases to facilitate SNAP data analytics. FNS has provided individualized assistance and training to several states across the country to build their capacity for data analytics on SNAP, consistent with several of GAO's leading practices. FNS provided assistance through grants, pilot projects, and training at conferences. The pilot projects also informed FNS's early efforts to help states improve their fraud prevention, detection, and investigation processes using data analytics. FNS's assistance to states has aligned with 4 of the 10 leading practices for data analytics identified by GAO in its Fraud Risk Framework. FNS officials said that FNS is in the early stages of promoting states' use of data analytics for SNAP fraud prevention and detection, and its efforts have focused on assessing the current capacity of states to use data analytics and determining analytic practices that are effective. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FNS develop and implement additional methods to widely disseminate information about states that have built support for data analytics and leveraged existing resources to implement or expand their data analytics programs to states seeking such examples. FNS agreed with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-231": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2005 BRAC round was the largest and most complex ever. The BRAC process was intended to reduce excess infrastructure, transform the military, and promote jointness. The BRAC Commission recommended that DOD close or realign installations, establish joint bases, and construct new facilities. The BRAC 2005 round ended on September 15, 2011. GAO was asked to review the BRAC process. This report assesses the extent that (1) DOD (1) measured the achievement of goals for reducing excess infrastructure, transforming the military, and promoting jointness for the 2005 BRAC round and (2) implemented prior GAO recommendations and addressed any additional challenges faced in BRAC 2005 to improve performance for any future BRAC round. GAO reviewed DOD's BRAC 2005 report and BRAC 2005 recommendations, and interviewed DOD officials and 26 military units or organizations. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) generally did not measure the achievement of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) goals\u2014reducing excess infrastructure, transforming the military, and promoting jointness. Specifically, a senior ASD (EI&E) official stated that no performance measures existed to evaluate the achievement of goals and the office did not create baselines to measure performance. Air Force officials stated that they did not measure the achievement of goals but that it would have been helpful to have metrics to measure success, especially as DOD had requested from Congress another BRAC round. Army officials similarly stated it did not measure the achievement of goals, noting that measuring excess capacity would have been important to help DOD get authorization for another BRAC round. Navy and Marine Corps officials said that they did not track performance measures or otherwise measure the achievement of the BRAC 2005 goals. Instead of measuring the achievement of BRAC 2005 goals, officials with ASD (EI&E) and the military departments stated that they tracked completion of the BRAC recommendations by the statutory deadline of September 2011 and measured the cost savings associated with the recommendations. Senior ASD (EI&E) officials stated that the primary measure of success was completing the recommendations as detailed by the implementation actions documented in the business plans. However, tracking completion of the recommendations and measuring savings did not enable the department to determine the success of the BRAC round in achieving its goals. Without a requirement to identify and measure the achievement of goals for a BRAC round, DOD cannot demonstrate to Congress whether the implementation of any future BRAC round will improve efficiency and effectiveness or otherwise have the effect that the department says its proposed recommendations will achieve. If Congress would like to increase its oversight for any future BRAC round, requiring DOD to identify appropriate measures of effectiveness and track achievement of its goals would provide it with improved visibility over the expected outcomes. DOD has implemented 33 of the 65 prior GAO recommendations that GAO identified in its work since 2004, and it has the opportunity to address additional challenges regarding communications and monitoring to improve any future BRAC round. Specifically, for the BRAC analysis phase, DOD implemented 1 of 12 recommendations, and it has agreed to implement another 7 recommendations should Congress authorize any future BRAC round. Additionally, GAO found that DOD can improve its communications during the analysis phase. For the implementation phase, DOD implemented 28 of 39 recommendations, and it has agreed to implement another 3 recommendations. Further, GAO found it can improve monitoring of mission-related changes. For the disposal phase, DOD implemented 4 of 14 recommendations, and it has agreed to implement another 8 recommendations. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD (1) ensure that ASD (EI&E) and the military departments take steps to establish clear and consistent communications throughout the department during data collection, and (2) provide specific guidance for the military departments to monitor and report mission-related changes that require significant changes to the recommendation business plans. DOD concurred with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-554": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government obligates about $3 billion annually for advertising contracts, which are contracts that provide information on the government's contract awards and obligations. GAO has previously reported that federal agencies have obligated more than $3 billion annually for advertising contracts. GAO was asked to review federal contracting with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB) and women-owned businesses. This report examines (1) the amount federal agencies have obligated on advertising contracts over the 5 most recent fiscal years (2013 through 2017) and the amount going to SDBs and women-owned businesses; and (2) the agencies that have directed the most advertising contract obligations to these businesses and how this has changed over time. GAO analyzed federal contract obligations data for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 and interviewed agency officials. GAO also analyzed federal advertising contract obligations to the five agencies that obligated the most on advertising contracts over the past 5 years. What GAO Found Over the past 5 fiscal years (2013 through 2017), federal agencies have obligated on average about $870 million annually for advertising contracts, with about 13 percent (approximately $114 million annually) of these obligations going to specified businesses. This share of advertising contract obligations going to these businesses over fiscal years 2013 through 2017 was consistent with the share of total federal contracting obligations going to these businesses (also on average 13 percent over this period). The amount of advertising contract obligations going to these businesses nearly doubled from fiscal year 2013 to 2017 (from $75 million to $147 million) and also increased as a percent of total advertising contract obligations (from 9 percent of these obligations to 16 percent). Specified businesses also represented an increasing share of businesses receiving advertising contract obligations, from 30 percent (194 businesses) in fiscal year 2013 to 39 percent (250 businesses) in fiscal year 2017. The most notable increase over the 5-year timeframe, both in dollars and as a percentage of total advertising contract obligations, was in the women-owned category, which increased by $56 million, or 93 percent. Specified businesses also represented an increasing share of businesses receiving advertising contract obligations, from 30 percent (194 businesses) in fiscal year 2013 to 39 percent (250 businesses) in fiscal year 2017. The most notable increase over the 5-year timeframe, both in dollars and as a percentage of total advertising contract obligations, was in the women-owned category, which increased by $56 million, or 93 percent. Specified businesses were those classified as small disadvantaged businesses (including those that self-identify as small disadvantaged businesses and those that are certified by the Small Business Administration for the 8(a) business development program), minority-owned businesses, and women-owned businesses. Minority-owned businesses were those categorized as being owned by Asian-Pacific-, Subcontinent-Asian-, Black-, Hispanic-, and Native-Americans, as well as \u201cother minorities.\u201d The departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), and Health and Human Services (HHS) were responsible for 73 percent of the $570 million of federal advertising contract obligations that went to specified businesses over fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Thirty four other agencies were responsible for the remaining 27 percent of these obligations. For each of the 5 years GAO reviewed, DOD, DHS, and HHS were consistently the top three agencies in terms of the amount of advertising contract obligations they directed to specified businesses. Additionally, all three generally increased the amounts they obligated to these businesses. For example, in fiscal year 2013, these three agencies obligated over 60 percent of all federal advertising contract obligations to specified businesses; in 2017 they accounted for more than 80 percent of these obligations. In several cases agencies directed more than half of their advertising contract obligations to specified businesses, though these agencies in general obligated less to advertising contracts than top-spending agencies. Ten agencies with advertising contract obligations of at least $1 million over fiscal years 2013 through 2017, such as the departments of Justice and Energy, directed at least half of their obligations to specified businesses. With the exception of DHS, which obligated about $200 million for advertising contracts over the 5-year period, these agencies all obligated less than $25 million for advertising contracts over this timeframe. In contrast, DOD directed a relatively small share (5 percent) of its advertising contract obligations to specified businesses, making it 29th out of 37 agencies when ranked according to the percentage of advertising contract obligations going to these businesses. However, because the department obligated a large amount for advertising contracts ($2.6 billion over the 5-year period), it ranked second in terms of the amount obligated to specified businesses.

DOD's 2017 excess capacity analysis does not have the accuracy and analytical sufficiency to provide Congress with a reasonable estimate of the actual excess capacity within the department. Specifically, DOD's use of a 1989 baseline for excess capacity results in inaccurate estimates of excess capacity; DOD's methodology included assumptions that were not always reasonable; and DOD's approach to estimating excess capacity is not always sufficient or implemented consistently across the military departments.

    "gao_GAO-18-172": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for securing the nation's commercial aviation system. TSA has a policy that requires that all passengers and property be screened before being transported on a commercial passenger aircraft. TSA also has the authority to enter into OTAs, which are legally enforceable promises between TSA and another party that are other than a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, lease, or loan. GAO was asked to review TSA's use of OTAs. This report examines (1) how TSA uses OTAs, (2) how TSA determines price reasonableness and monitors selected OTAs, and (3) the extent to which TSA has implemented OTA oversight. GAO reviewed TSA's OTA policy and analyzed OTA data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. GAO also interviewed TSA officials. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported obligating millions annually through OTAs, which amounted to at least $1.4 billion, or about 13 percent of its overall obligations. Five TSA reimbursement programs used OTAs to partially or fully reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the allowable costs associated with TSA security programs such as the design and construction of checked baggage inline systems. These five reimbursement programs accounted for about 99 percent of the $1.1 billion that TSA obligated on OTAs that were awarded during this period. The remaining three non-reimbursement programs accounted for a small amount of obligations and awarded a low number of OTAs for services including intelligence analysis and the development of aviation standards. GAO's review of 29 OTAs awarded by 8 TSA programs from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 found that the methods used to determine price reasonableness and monitor these OTAs varied based on the complexity of the requirement. For example, for OTAs awarded by the Electronic Baggage Screening Program where the requirements for infrastructure design and construction can be complex, the program produces an independent government cost estimate based on design drawings and specifications from the airports which are required to follow TSA's detailed guidance. The program compares the estimate with the airport authority's independent bid for the design and construction. TSA's contracting officer's representative (COR) is the primary interface between TSA and the airport and is responsible for performing stakeholder coordination functions. For the 29 OTAs GAO reviewed, the methods used to determine price reasonableness and monitor these OTAs varied based on the complexity of the requirement. For example, for OTAs awarded by the Electronic Baggage Screening Program where the requirements for infrastructure design and construction can be complex, the program produces an independent government cost estimate based on design drawings and specifications from the airports which are required to follow TSA's detailed guidance. TSA's OTA policy requires contracting officers to determine that the price negotiated under the OTA is reasonable and to appoint a COR to provide monitoring and a range of administration tasks to ensure that requirements are satisfactorily delivered. For the key areas GAO reviewed, the OTAs generally met the requirements of TSA's policy. Nonetheless, TSA's own 2015 internal compliance review found significant gaps in OTA documentation and reporting. In response to these deficiencies, TSA has taken action to strengthen oversight and compliance with its policy. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making recommendations in this report.",
    "gao_GAO-18-236": "Why GAO Did This Study TSA is responsible for ensuring that the nation's aviation security system is adequately protected. TSA operates a screening process that includes screening passengers and their baggage using TSA equipment and screening checked baggage using TSA equipment. TSA uses a computer-based staffing allocation model to allocate staff to airports. GAO was asked to review TSA's process for allocating staff to airports. This report examines (1) how TSA's staffing allocation model is modified and how TSA uses airport-specific information to tailor staffing levels to individual airports, and (2) how TSA monitors airport operations and responds to increases in passenger wait times and throughput. GAO reviewed TSA's staffing allocation model, analyzed wait time and throughput data, and interviewed TSA officials at headquarters and eight airports selected based on the number of TSOs and airport size and configuration. What GAO Found The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) modified the assumptions used in its staffing allocation model (model) to reflect changes identified through annual evaluations performed by a contractor. The contractor is specifically tasked with evaluating the assumptions related to the time needed to screen passengers and their baggage. For example, TSA officials stated that they increased the expected time needed to screen passengers for one type of passenger screening equipment in fiscal year 2017 because the contractor found that the actual time needed was more than the assumption TSA used in fiscal year 2016. Similarly, in fiscal year 2016, TSA allocated fewer staff to review images of checked baggage, compared to previous years, because the contractor's evaluation determined it took TSA less time to review the images than the time observed in previous years. TSA uses airport-specific information to tailor staffing levels to individual airports' needs. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2016, TSA used passenger throughput forecasts to allocate staff commensurate with the expected rate of increase in passenger throughput at each airport. The estimated increase in passenger throughput for each fiscal year is based primarily on national and airport-level data from the previous 3 months from the TSA's web-based data collection system, TSA's web-based data collection system, and flight forecast data from the airline industry, as well as additional input from other sources. TSA uses airport-specific information to tailor staffing levels to individual airport needs. For example, TSA headquarters officials use airport-specific data on staff availability, training needs, supervisory needs, and additional security layers to manually adjust the model's staffing allocation output at a line item level. TSA uses passenger wait time and throughput data to monitor airport operations and respond to increases in passenger wait times and throughput. TSA requires all airports to enter their wait time and throughput data daily into the Performance Measurement Information System (PMIS), TSA's web-based data collection system, no later than 3:30 AM Eastern Time of the next calendar day so that the data can be included in the morning's Daily Leadership Report. TSA also monitors airport operations at 28 airports in near real time. TSA airport officials use a variety of tools to respond to increases in passenger wait times and throughput. TSA officials at select airports use passenger screening canines to expedite the screening process and support screening operations during increased passenger throughput and wait time periods. TSA headquarters has taken steps intended to improve information sharing with stakeholders about staffing and related screening procedures at airports. For example, TSA headquarters officials hold daily conference calls with industry association, airline, and airport officials at the 28 airports monitored by the Airport Operations Center (AOC). TSA headquarters officials also held presentations and meetings with industry, airline, and airport officials to discuss TSA's staffing allocation model, security enhancements at airports, and airport screening processes, among other things. Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally reported improved satisfaction with TSA headquarters information sharing efforts and with most TSA airport-level staff. For example, officials from seven of eight airlines and all eight airports GAO visited stated that they have positive relationships with their FSDs and that their FSDs were accessible and available when needed, while the remaining airline official noted improving access to information.

    "gao_GAO-18-100": "Why GAO Did This Study The Medicare FFS program, which consists of two parts, consists of 38 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. The current design includes separate deductibles for Part A and Part B services, a variety of per-service copayments and coinsurance after the deductibles are met, and no cap on beneficiaries' cost-sharing responsibilities. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2015 included a provision for GAO to review the Medicare FFS cost-sharing design. This report examines (1) the current Medicare FFS cost-sharing design, (2) the potential effects of modernizing the design, and (3) the potential effects of modernizing the design on beneficiaries' cost-sharing responsibilities. GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from CMS, the American Academy of Actuaries, and other experts. GAO also analyzed four illustrative cost-sharing designs that were illustrative in terms of the number of beneficiaries, the cost-sharing responsibilities, and the number of beneficiaries with cost-sharing responsibilities. GAO also interviewed experts and reviewed studies and experts on the design. What GAO Found The current Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) cost-sharing design can be confusing, contribute to beneficiaries' overuse of services, and leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs. Modernizing the design could address these concerns, but would involve trade-offs. For example, maintaining Medicare's share of costs would involve a trade-off between the level of the cap and the deductible (or other cost-sharing). The current Medicare FFS cost-sharing design can be confusing, contribute to beneficiaries' overuse of services, and leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs. Modernizing the design could address these concerns, but would involve trade-offs. For example, maintaining Medicare's share of costs would involve a trade-off between the level of the cap and the deductible (or other cost-sharing). The direct effect of modernizing the Medicare FFS cost-sharing design (i.e., the effect when holding utilization and enrollment constant) on beneficiaries' cost-sharing responsibilities would depend on the specific revisions and the time horizon examined. The direct effect of modernizing the Medicare FFS cost-sharing design (i.e., the effect when holding utilization and enrollment constant) on beneficiaries' cost-sharing responsibilities would depend on the specific revisions and the time horizon examined. The current Medicare FFS cost-sharing design would affect beneficiaries' costs indirectly through beneficiaries' and supplemental insurers' behavioral responses to altered incentives, according to the studies GAO reviewed and experts GAO spoke to. These studies and experts identified several types of behavioral responses that would influence the net effect of a modernized design on beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs, including changes in beneficiaries' demand for, and insurers' supply of, supplemental insurance; changes in beneficiaries' utilization of services; changes in Medicare beneficiaries' enrollment in FFS versus MA; and interactions among these and other behavioral responses, including effects on the price of supplemental insurance. According to studies and experts GAO interviewed, implementing a modernized design would likely trigger changes in the demand for, and supply of, supplemental insurance. For example, a focus group of current and future Medicare beneficiaries convened by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and a report from the American Academy of Actuaries stated that the addition of an annual cap would reduce the need of some beneficiaries to purchase supplemental insurance. While beneficiaries who drop their supplemental insurance would then need to pay all their Medicare cost-sharing responsibilities, those might be less than their annual premium for supplemental insurance. Additionally, according to experts GAO interviewed and studies GAO reviewed, different behavioral responses would also likely interact and affect beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs. For example, a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation and a report by the Congressional Budget Office both anticipated that a modernized design could change the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who decide to enroll in FFS or MA. Similarly, officials from the American Academy of Actuaries told GAO that they would expect a change in demand for MA under a modernized design.

    "gao_GAO-19-66": "Why GAO Did This Study VA has a mission to prevent veteran suicide. In 2010, VHA began a suicide prevention media outreach campaign to raise awareness about VHA's suicide prevention resources. In September 2016, VHA awarded a new contract to a contractor to provide both suicide prevention and mental health media outreach. GAO was asked to review VHA's suicide prevention media outreach. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA's suicide prevention media outreach activities declined in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 compared to earlier years of the campaign, and (2) the extent to which VHA monitors the effectiveness of its suicide prevention media outreach campaign. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed VA and contractor officials; and analyzed VHA's suicide prevention media outreach activities. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has decreased in recent years in its suicide prevention media outreach activities due to leadership turnover and reorganization. For example, VHA officials said the National Director for Suicide Prevention position was vacant from July 2017 through April 2018. VHA filled the position temporarily with a 6-month detail from another agency from October 2017 through March 2018 and then hired this individual as the permanent director on April 30, 2018. VHA officials that worked on the campaign told GAO they shifted their focus away from the suicide prevention media outreach campaign toward the mental health outreach campaign due to reorganization of the offices responsible for suicide prevention activities in 2017. Specifically, under the new organization, and in the absence of suicide prevention program leadership, the officials began reporting directly to mental health program leadership and became more focused on the mental health outreach aspects of the contract. Following the reorganization, officials that worked on the campaign did not have a clear line of reporting to the suicide prevention program. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards for control environment, which require agencies to assign responsibilities to achieve its objectives. If a key role is vacant, management needs to determine by whom and how those responsibilities will be fulfilled in order to meet its objectives. VHA works with its contractor to create and monitor metrics to help gauge the effectiveness of its suicide prevention media outreach campaign in raising awareness among veterans and others about VHA services, such as the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL). The metrics primarily focus on the number of individuals who were exposed to or interacted with VHA's suicide prevention content across various forms of outreach, including social media, public service announcements (PSA), and websites. According to VHA, the metrics are intended to help VHA ensure that its media outreach activities achieve intended results, such as increasing awareness and use of the resources identified on the VCL website. VHA officials told GAO that the metrics are intended to help VHA ensure that its media outreach activities achieve intended results, such as increasing awareness and use of the resources identified on the VCL website. However, VHA has not established targets for the majority of the metrics it uses to help gauge the effectiveness of its suicide prevention media outreach campaign. As a result, VHA does not have the information it needs to fully evaluate the campaign's effectiveness in raising awareness of VHA's suicide prevention resources among veterans, including the VCL. For example, GAO found that VHA's contractor's monitoring reports\u2014a summary of key metrics that VHA uses to routinely monitor information regarding the campaign\u2014generally focused on outreach \u201chighlights\u201d and positive results. The reports did not set expectations based on past outreach or targets for new outreach, and lacked more comprehensive information on whether outreach performed against these expectations. For example, a monitoring report from 2018 showed that during one month, there were 21,000 social media mentions of keywords specific to VA suicide prevention, such as \u201cVCL\u201d or \u201cveteran suicide,\u201d across social media platforms. These mentions earned 120 million impressions; however, there was no indication of the number of keyword mentions or impressions that VHA expected based on its media outreach activities. In addition, the report did not indicate the proportion of mentions that VHA believed were specifically driven by its outreach activities, and there also was no indication of whether these mentions were positive or negative, or what actions to take based on this information. VHA officials told GAO that they have not established targets for most of the suicide prevention media outreach campaign because they lack meaningful targets for the metrics to help evaluate the campaign. VHA officials said that the only target they have established is for each PSA to rank in the top 10 percent of the Nielsen ratings because this is the only meaningful target available that is accepted industry-wide. VHA officials stated that using any other targets would be arbitrary. For the remaining metrics, VHA officials told GAO they assess the outcomes of their campaign by comparing data from year to year, and examining any changes in the outcomes over time. However",
    "gao_GAO-18-127": "Why GAO Did This Study The number of vehicles affected by safety defect vehicle recalls has increased dramatically since 2011. In 2011, NHTSA initiated a recall of over 8 million vehicles with faulty ignition switches. In 2015, NHTSA began a national advertising campaign encouraging consumers to check for open recalls using the agency's vehicle identification number (VIN) and year, make, and model look-up tools. In 2016, NHTSA began consolidating its websites into NHTSA.gov to provide a single access point for its auto recall content. GAO was asked to review the use of publicly available auto recall information. This report examines (1) how consumers and industry stakeholders use publicly available auto recall information; (2) how easy or difficult to use consumers find the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov; and (3) steps, if any, NHTSA has taken to raise consumer awareness about auto recalls and how NHTSA evaluated the effectiveness of these steps. GAO analyzed NHTSA data on recalls, interviewed NHTSA officials, and conducted 12 focus group discussions with 94 consumers. What GAO Found Consumers in focus groups GAO conducted with used and new vehicle owners who had experienced an auto recall in the last 24 months selected safety risk and convenience as the two most influential factors they considered when using auto recall information to decide whether to complete repairs. Consumers in the sessions overwhelmingly selected safety risk as the most influential factor they considered when making repair decisions. Consumers in the sessions overwhelmingly selected safety risk as the second most influential factor they considered when making repair decisions. While most consumers in our focus groups reported a preference to receive auto recall notification by mail, most preferred to receive notifications by at least one additional electronic means such as e-mail, phone calls, and text messages. Although the vast majority of consumers in our focus groups reported a preference to receive auto recall notification by mail, most preferred to receive notifications by at least one additional electronic means such as e-mail, phone calls, and text messages. Although most consumers in our focus groups found the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov easy to use, some consumers experienced difficulties completing tasks GAO asked them to perform. For example, some consumers found the search results did not provide the information they were seeking. Federal key website usability practices state that agencies should ensure that results of user searches provide the precise information being sought, and in a format matching users' expectations. Federal key website usability practices state that agencies should communicate quality information externally and select appropriate methods for communicating with the public. While most consumers in our usability testing sessions found the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov easy to use, some consumers experienced difficulties completing tasks GAO asked them to perform. For example, some consumers found that they did not know enough information about their specific vehicles to feel confident that they were searching for the correct vehicle. Federal key website usability practices state that agencies should write website content using plain language, so website visitors can easily find and use what they need. NHTSA has initiated activities to raise consumer awareness about auto recalls, but it is too early to evaluate the agency's efforts. NHTSA began a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of informing consumers about open recalls during vehicle registration. In September 2016, NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposes to require manufacturers to notify consumers about open recalls by electronic means\u2014such as e-mails, phone calls, and text messages, in addition to First-Class Mail. NHTSA officials told GAO the agency is working with the administration on NHTSA's regulatory portfolio and priorities, including this rulemaking. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Administrator of NHTSA determine a completion date for the agency's website consolidation effort. The Administrator of NHTSA should, while the agency continues its website consolidation effort, take interim steps to improve the usability of the auto recall areas of NHTSA. DOT concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-305": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government enacted SMCRA to regulate the surface effects of coal mining and reclamation. SMCRA requires that financial assurances be sufficient to ensure reclamation compliant with water quality standards. OSMRE oversees the coal program in 23 states and four Indian tribes. GAO was asked to review the financial assurances that OSMRE and state regulatory authorities have received. This report examines (1) the amount of financial assurances that state regulatory authorities and OSMRE have held as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation, (2) the steps OSMRE has taken to oversee financial assurances, and (3) the challenges that OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. GAO reviewed federal and state regulations and OSMRE and state regulatory authority data on financial assurances held as financial assurances for coal mine reclamation. GAO also interviewed federal and state regulatory authority officials, representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries, and representatives from environmental nongovernmental organizations. What GAO Found The Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) reported holding a total of approximately $10.2 billion in financial assurances for coal mine reclamation in 2017. Of the total amount of financial assurances, approximately 76 percent ($7.8 billion) were in the form of surety bonds, 12 percent ($1.2 billion) in collateral bonds, and 12 percent ($1.2 billion) in self-bonds. Of the total amount of financial assurances, approximately 76 percent ($7.8 billion) were in the form of surety bonds, 12 percent ($1.2 billion) in collateral bonds, and 12 percent ($1.2 billion) in self-bonds. Twenty-four states reported holding surety bonds, 20 states reported holding collateral bonds, and 8 states reported holding self-bonds. In addition, OSMRE officials identified 6 states\u2014Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia\u2014that have also established alternative bonding systems, such as bond pools. OSMRE has taken a variety of steps to oversee financial assurances and aspects of the mining and reclamation process that can affect whether the amount of financial assurances obtained will cover the cost of required reclamation. For example, OSMRE and state regulatory authorities periodically review financial assurance amounts, inspect mine sites, and review state programs that implement SMCRA. OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face a number of challenges in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation\u2014including those related to self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies\u2014according to federal and selected state regulatory authority officials, representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries, and representatives from environmental nongovernmental organizations. For example, OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face challenges in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation\u2014including those related to self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies\u2014according to federal and selected state regulatory authority officials, representatives from organizations associated with the mining and financial assurance industries, and representatives from environmental nongovernmental organizations. For example, OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face challenges in managing the risk associated with self-bonding. For example, the financial relationships between parent and subsidiary companies have become increasingly complex, making it difficult to ascertain an operator's financial health on the basis of information reported in company financial and accounting documents. OSMRE and state regulatory authorities may find it difficult to get operators to replace existing self-bonds with other financial assurances if needed, according to some parties GAO interviewed. For example, in 2015 the Wyoming regulatory authority determined that an operator no longer qualified for self-bonding and ordered it to replace a $411 million self-bond. However, the operator entered into bankruptcy without having replaced the self-bond. OSMRE recently announced that it is reconsidering the need for and scope of potential changes to its self-bonding regulations. OSMRE officials said that they did not have a timeline for finalizing a decision on potential changes in its bonding regulations. In addition, OSMRE rescinded its August 2016 policy advisory that states take steps to assess whether operators currently using self-bonds can still quality to do so and that states not accept any new self-bonds. What GAO Recommends Congress should consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation. The Department of the Interior did not provide written comments on GAO's findings and matter for congressional consideration. OSMRE provided technical comments in an e-mail, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.",
    "gao_GAO-18-375": "Why GAO Did This Study VHA provides outpatient care through CBOCs, which are clinics that provide primary care and mental health care services, and also may provide specialty care services such as cardiology or neurology, in an outpatient setting. VHA policy requires that VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs provide the same standard of care to veterans that is of high quality. GAO was asked to review VHA's oversight of CBOCs. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs provide the same standard of care and (2) the extent to which VHA has implemented oversight requirements and the extent to which the CBOC Report provides accurate and complete information on CBOCs. GAO reviewed VHA policies and procedures, interviewed VHA officials, and compared the CBOC Report to VHA's most recent CBOC Report. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates multi-specialty outpatient clinics (CBOC) that provide primary care and mental health care services, and also may provide specialty care services such as cardiology or neurology, in an outpatient setting. VHA-operated CBOCs provided more specialty care and less primary care and mental health care as a proportion of their total provided services than contracted CBOCs in fiscal years 2014 through 2016. For example, in fiscal year 2016, specialty care (e.g., cardiology, gastroenterology, physical therapy) comprised 13 percent of services provided at VHA-operated clinics and 5 percent of services provided at contracted clinics. In contrast, VHA-operated clinics provided proportionally less primary care and mental health services (services offered at all CBOCs) in fiscal year 2016\u2014these services comprised 66 percent of the services provided at VHA-operated clinics, but 84 percent of the services provided at contracted clinics. GAO found that VHA-operated CBOCs had higher per-encounter expenditures than contracted CBOCs\u2014a difference ranging from 3 to 5 percent per encounter. GAO also found that per-encounter expenditures for almost all service types were higher on average for VHA-operated CBOCs than contracted CBOCs in fiscal year 2016. VHA has not fully implemented oversight requirements, and inaccurate information limits its oversight of CBOC quality of care. Specifically, VHA has not fully implemented oversight requirements that align with its established policies, including a requirement to establish guidelines for monitoring quality of care in CBOCs. The CBOC Report, which is VHA's only report that allows for comparing clinical quality of care data across VHA-operated and contracted clinics, lacks accurate and complete information. These gaps limit the CBOC Report's usefulness as a monitoring tool to determine whether VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs are providing the same standard of care. This is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control for information and communication, which state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Specifically, VHA distributes the CBOC Report to the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and Veterans Integrated Service Centers (VAMC) on a quarterly and year-end basis, which compiles CBOC quality of care performance results based on the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), an industry standard set of quality measures. VISNs and VAMCs have access to other types of CBOC performance data, such as patient satisfaction data and wait time data, but these data are not used to assess clinical quality of care and cannot be used to examine performance across all CBOCs or stratified by VHA-operated versus contracted CBOCs. In contrast, the CBOC Report allows for the comparison of clinical quality of care data across all CBOCs, which can be stratified according to whether the clinic is VHA-operated or contracted. However, GAO found that the CBOC Report, which is VHA's only report that allows for comparing clinical quality of care data across both VHA-operated and contracted clinics, lacks accurate and complete information. These gaps limit the CBOC Report's usefulness as a monitoring tool to determine whether VHA-operated and contracted CBOCs are providing the same standard of care. This is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control related to the control environment, which state that management should, among other things, develop personnel to achieve the entity's objectives.

NASA's approach for integrating and assessing the programmatic and technical readiness of these programs differs from prior NASA human spaceflight programs. GAO was asked to review NASA's approach for integrating and assessing the programmatic and technical readiness of the three programs. This report assesses (1) the benefits and challenges of NASA's approach for integrating and assessing the programmatic and technical readiness of Orion, SLS, and EGS; and (2) the extent to which the Exploration Systems Development (ESD) organization is managing cross-program risks that could affect launch readiness. GAO reviewed NASA policies and procedures, interviewed NASA officials, and analyzed ESD's integration plans. What GAO Found NASA's approach for integrating and assessing the programmatic and technical readiness of its current human spaceflight programs differs from prior NASA human spaceflight programs. This new approach offers some cost and potential efficiency benefits. However, it also brings challenges specific to its structure. In particular, there are oversight challenges because only one of the three programs, Orion, has a cost and schedule estimate for Exploration Mission-2. NASA is already contractually obligating money on SLS and EGS for EM-2, but the lack of cost and schedule baselines for these programs will make it difficult to assess progress over time. Additionally, the approach creates an environment of competing interests because it relies on dual-hatd staff to manage technical and safety aspects on behalf of ESD while also serving as independent oversight of those same areas. Despite the development and integration challenges associated with a new human spaceflight capability, ESD has improved its overall cross-program risk posture over the past 2 years. Nonetheless, it still faces key integration risk areas within software development and verification and validation (V&V). Both are critical to readiness for EM-1 because software acts as the \"brain\" that ties SLS, Orion, and EGS together in a functioning body, while V&V ensures the integrated body works as expected. The success of these efforts forms the foundation for a launch, no matter the date of EM-1. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that NASA establish separate cost and schedule baselines for work required to support SLS and EGS for EM-2 and establish separate cost and schedule baselines for each additional capability that encompass all life cycle costs, to include operations and sustainment. NASA partially concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-17-773": "Why GAO Did This Study DNN manages a broad range of programs that address the security of nuclear materials worldwide. DNN's programs include removing and disposing of excess nuclear material from civilian sites worldwide, converting civilian research reactors to the use of non-weapons-useable nuclear fuel, and improving the security of weapons-useable nuclear material in key countries. GAO was asked to review DNN's schedule and cost management. This report examines the extent to which (1) selected subprograms within DNN use program management leading practices to manage schedule and cost, and (2) DNN has incorporated program management leading practices in its revised program management policy. GAO reviewed DNN's program management policies and interviewed DNN officials. GAO also reviewed DNN's revised program management policy. What GAO Found The four selected subprograms within the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) generally do not use selected leading program management practices to manage schedule and cost. Specifically, at the time of GAO's review, none of the subprograms had schedule and cost estimates that encompassed its entire life cycle, although one subprogram planned to develop such estimates for its recently-extended life cycle. In addition, none of the selected subprograms measure their overall schedule and cost performance against baseline estimates. NNSA officials said that the subprograms had not developed schedule and cost estimates that cover their life cycles and did not measure the subprograms against baselines due, in part, to uncertainty in planning scope and schedules that rely on the cooperation of other countries. DNN also does not require subprograms to have such estimates or to measure performance against schedule and cost baselines. Following these practices, however, would provide NNSA managers and other stakeholders more complete information to evaluate how much the subprograms may cost to achieve their goals, the amount of time they may need to achieve these goals, and their actual versus planned performance. DNN's 2017 revised program management policy includes some leading practices, but does not address life-cycle schedule and cost management for DNN programs or subprograms. Specifically, the revised policy does not outline requirements for programs or subprograms to establish life-cycle cost estimates or measure performance against schedule or cost baselines. Instead, the revised policy provides requirements on schedule and cost management limited to the NNSA budgeting process covering the 5-year FYNSP. According to leading practices, life-cycle management is important to program management and includes schedule and cost management activities that span the duration of the program.

    "gao_GAO-18-54": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees 22 commodity check-off programs that promote the sale of a commodity through generic promotion, research, and consumer and industry information. AMS is responsible for overseeing these programs. In 2012, the USDA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that AMS had weak oversight controls over the 22 commodity check-off programs. GAO was asked to review AMS's oversight of the 22 commodity check-off programs. This report examines (1) AMS's response to recommendations made in the OIG report and (2) the extent to which AMS conducts and evaluates independent economic evaluations of the effectiveness of the 22 commodity check-off programs. GAO reviewed AMS's guidelines and procedures, interviewed agency officials, and reviewed eight independent economic evaluations of the effectiveness of the 22 commodity check-off programs. What GAO Found The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has responded to recommendations for improving its oversight of commodity check-off programs, but some oversight activities are not consistent across programs. AMS has responded to recommendations for improving oversight made in the OIG's 2012 report, particularly by developing and implementing standard operating procedures and conducting internal reviews of AMS check-off program oversight. However, AMS does not provide consistent oversight across check-off programs in some areas; specifically, it does not routinely review check-off program subcontracts during its management reviews, conduct follow-up on management review recommendations, ensure that financial assurances are included in annual audits, or ensure that check-off boards share information with assessment payers on program websites. In conducting their oversight of the check-off programs, senior agency officials and marketing specialists said they face challenges because of increased use of social media, the absence of an information system for tracking approvals, and complex Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for some programs, which may delay the completion of some oversight priorities. AMS has conducted and evaluated independent economic evaluations of the effectiveness of the 22 commodity check-off programs, which have generally shown a positive benefit to those who pay assessments. The evaluations GAO reviewed varied both in the methods used to conduct the analysis and how information was reported and revealed certain methodological limitations. According to agency officials as well as the economists who conducted the evaluations, the variations are in part due to the differences in check-off board resources. GAO found that AMS does not consistently document its review of independent economic evaluations and has no criteria established for determining what makes for a credible methodology and results. Without developing criteria by which AMS can assess the methodology and results of independent evaluations and document those assessments, the assessments may be inconsistent across check-off programs and misleading to agency officials, check-off boards, and assessment payers. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that AMS revise its standard operating procedures for check-off programs to recognize that management reviews should include a sample of subcontracts for review, establish a mechanism for documenting and tracking follow-up with checkoff boards on the implementation of management review recommendations, ensure that independent financial audits contain statements of assurance, and include in its guidelines and standard operating procedures that key check-off board documents, such as bylaws and policy statements, annual reports, and independent economic evaluations of economic effectiveness are posted on the check-off programs' websites. AMS generally agreed with GAO's findings and recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-474": "Why GAO Did This Study VAMCs use reusable medical equipment (RME) to perform medical procedures. RME is a complex and time-consuming process that requires a corresponding increase in the skills and time required to safely reprocess them. VHA has developed policies that VAMCs are required to follow to help ensure that RME is reprocessed correctly. GAO was asked to review VAMCs' reprocessing of RME. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA oversees VAMCs' adherence to RME policies and (2) the challenges VAMCs face in operating their SPS programs. GAO reviewed VHA policies and inspections, interviewed VHA officials, and reviewed relevant reports. GAO also interviewed officials from all 18 VISNs and selected VAMCs selected based on geographic dispersion and other factors. What GAO Found The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has not ensured that it has complete information from the annual inspections of VAMCs to have reasonable assurance that VAMCs are following reusable medical equipment (RME) policies intended to ensure veterans are receiving safe care. For fiscal year 2017, GAO determined that VHA should have had records of 144 VISN Sterile Processing System (SPS) inspection reports to have assurance that all required VISN SPS inspections had been conducted. However, GAO found that as of February 2018, VHA had 105 VISN SPS inspection reports and was missing 39, or more than one quarter of the required inspection reports. GAO also found that variation in SPS Inspection Tools and related guidance from VHA resulted in incomplete inspection results for the gastroenterology and dental areas. GAO also found that VHA does not consistently share information, particularly inspection results, with VISNs and VAMCs, and that VISNs and VAMCs would like more of this information. Until this sharing becomes a regular practice, VHA is missing an opportunity to help ensure adherence to its RME policies, which are intended to ensure that veterans are receiving safe care. VAMCs report facing challenges related to RME policies and workforce needs, but VHA has not sufficiently addressed these challenges. According to officials from all of the 18 VISNs and selected VAMCs, the top five challenges VAMCs face in operating their SPS programs are related to meeting certain RME policies and challenges addressing SPS workforce needs. In particular, officials reported experiencing challenges related to lengthy hiring timeframes, need for consistent overtime, and limited pay and professional growth. For example, officials from one VISN estimated that on average it can take 3 to 4 months for a person to be hired. Officials from a few other VISNs noted that not only does the lengthy hiring process create challenges in recruiting qualified candidates (because they accept other positions where they can be more quickly employed), but that it also results in long periods of time when SPS programs are short-staffed. Further, some VISN and VAMC officials told GAO that difficulties maintaining sufficient SPS staff levels have in some instances adversely affected patients' access to care and increased the potential for reprocessing errors that could affect patient safety. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VHA (1) ensure all RME inspections are being conducted and reported as required and that the inspection results VHA has are complete; (2) analyze and share top common RME inspection findings and possible solutions with VISNs and VAMCs; and (3) examine the SPS workforce needs and take action based on this assessment, as appropriate. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-19-63": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government obligates tens of billions annually on IT. In fiscal year 2017, the federal government obligated more than $15 billion on IT products and services. GAO was asked to review the use of noncompetitive contracts for IT. This report examines (1) the extent to which agencies used noncompetitive contracts to procure IT products and services for fiscal years 2013 through 2017; (2) the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts for selected IT procurements; (3) the extent to which IT procurements at selected agencies were bridge contracts; and (4) the extent to which noncompetitive IT procurements at selected agencies were in support of legacy systems. GAO analyzed government-wide data on IT obligations from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 and a generalizable sample of 142 contracts and orders from a generalizable sample of 142 contracts and orders. GAO also interviewed agency officials. What GAO Found Federal agencies reported annually obligating between $53 billion in fiscal year 2013 to $59 billion in fiscal year 2017 on information technology (IT)-related products and services. Of that amount, agencies reported that more than $15 billion each year\u2014or about 30 percent of all obligations for IT products and services\u2014were awarded noncompetitively. However, in a generalizable sample of contracts and orders, GAO found significant errors in certain types of orders, which call into question the reliability of competition data associated with roughly $3 billion per year in obligations. As a result, the actual amount agencies obligated on noncompetitive contract awards for IT products and services is unknown. GAO estimates that about 8 percent of fiscal year 2016 IT noncompetitive contracts and orders above $150,000 were bridge contracts. Bridge contracts can be a useful tool in certain circumstances to avoid a gap in providing products and services, but they are typically envisioned to be used for short periods of time. GAO found that in 9 of the 15 cases, bridge contracts were associated with additional bridges not apparent in the documentation related to the contract and order GAO reviewed, such as a joint and agreement (J&A). Agency officials cited a variety of reasons for needing bridge contracts, including acquisition planning challenges, source selection challenges, and bid protests. GAO found that about 7 percent of IT noncompetitive contracts and orders over $150,000 in fiscal year 2016 at selected agencies were in support of legacy IT systems as newly defined in statute, which is considerably fewer than GAO found when using the previous definition of legacy IT. Using this definition, GAO estimated that about 80 percent of IT noncompetitive contracts and orders over $150,000 in fiscal year 2016 at selected agencies were awarded in support of legacy IT systems. In December 2017, Congress enacted the Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT) as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This act defined a legacy IT system as an \u201coutdated or obsolete system of information technology.\u201d Using this new definition, GAO estimated that about 7 percent of IT noncompetitive contracts and orders over $150,000 in fiscal year 2016 at selected agencies were awarded in support of legacy IT systems. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense identify the reasons behind the high rate of miscoding for orders awarded under multiple award contracts and use this information to identify and take action to improve the reliability of the competition data entered into the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). DOD and HHS concurred with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-295": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government spends billions of dollars annually to acquire heavy equipment, including equipment such as cranes, backhoes, and road maintenance equipment. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to conduct a lease-versus-purchase analysis before acquiring heavy equipment. GAO was asked to review the acquisition process for heavy equipment. This report addresses: (1) the number, type, and cost of heavy equipment items that are owned by the 24 CFO Act agencies; (2) the heavy equipment items selected agencies have recently acquired and how selected agencies decided to purchase or lease this equipment; and (3) how selected agencies manage the utilization of their heavy equipment. GAO analyzed data from the 24 CFO Act agencies on their heavy equipment, reviewed agency documents, and interviewed officials from the three selected agencies. What GAO Found Twenty agencies reported owning over 136,000 pieces of heavy equipment, at an acquisition cost of over $7.4 billion. The Department of Defense (DOD) reported owning most of this heavy equipment\u2014over 100,000 items, about 74 percent. The Department of Agriculture reported owning the second highest number of heavy equipment items\u2014almost 9,000 items, about 6 percent. Four agencies\u2014the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Agency for International Development\u2014reported owning five or fewer heavy equipment items each. The 20 agencies reported spending over $7.4 billion in 2016 dollars to acquire the heavy equipment they own. However, actual spending was higher because this inflation-adjusted figure excludes over 37,000 heavy equipment items for which the agencies did not report acquisition cost or acquisition year, or both. Without this information, GAO could not determine the inflation-adjusted cost and therefore did not include the cost of these items in GAO's calculation. The three selected agencies purchased almost 3,500 pieces of heavy equipment in calendar years 2012 through 2016, but did not consistently document lease-versus-purchase analyses. The Air Force spent over $300 million to purchase over 2,600 heavy equipment assets in calendar years 2012 through 2016. The Fish and Wildlife Service spent over $32 million to purchase 348 heavy equipment assets from calendar years 2012 through 2016. The National Park Service spent over $27 million to purchase 471 heavy equipment assets from calendar years 2012 through 2016. The Air Force did not document lease-versus-purchase analyses for six of the eight acquisitions GAO reviewed. For example, Air Force officials were unable to provide documentation of a lease-versus-purchase analysis for six of the eight acquisitions GAO reviewed. Air Force officials said that they did not believe a lease-versus-purchase analysis was required because the new equipment was either replacing old equipment that was previously approved or could be deployed. However, the Air Force does not have guidance that describes the circumstances that require either a lease-versus-purchase analysis or documentation of the rationale for not completing such analysis. Air Force officials said that they consider mission needs and equipment availability, among other factors when making these decisions. Without greater clarity regarding when to conduct or document lease-versus-purchase analyses, officials at the three selected agencies may not be conducting such analyses when appropriate and may not always make the best acquisition decisions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Air Force develop guidance to clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchase analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The Department of the Interior concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-221": "Why GAO Did This Study DOD spends billions of dollars each year to purchase goods and services overseas and pay service-members stationed abroad. DOD uses its budget rates to liquidate its overseas operations and maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel (MILPERS) appropriations. In fiscal year 2012, Congress appropriated $970 million to the FCFD account to cover losses that the services experienced due to foreign currency fluctuations. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of its FCFD account. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD revised its budget rates in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, (2) the extent to which DOD has taken steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates at which to make disbursements and determine whether opportunities exist to achieve additional savings, and (3) the extent to which DOD has effectively managed the FCFD account to cover losses and maintained quality information to manage these funds. GAO analyzed DOD budget rates and foreign currency disbursements for fiscal years 2009 through 2016, reviewed DOD financial reports, and interviewed DOD and service officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) revised its foreign currency budget rates in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, which resulted in budget rates in these years that were more closely aligned with rates published by the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury). The revised budget rates decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs and any potential gains and losses that would have occurred due to foreign currency fluctuations. DOD's use of revised budget rates decreased DOD's projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs and any potential gains and losses that would have occurred due to foreign currency fluctuations. DOD has taken some steps to reduce costs in selecting foreign currency rates to liquidate its obligations through disbursements, but has not fully explored additional opportunities to achieve savings. For example, DOD has not fully determined whether additional cost-saving opportunities exist because the services have not reviewed the rates used for foreign currency disbursements. DOD has used the FCFD account to cover losses that the services experienced due to foreign currency fluctuations in 6 of the 8 years GAO reviewed. However, DOD does not effectively manage the FCFD account balance based on projected losses or quality data. Transfers of unobligated balances from MILPERS and O&M accounts into the FCFD account have been made to replenish the account balance to the statutory limit of $970 million, without consideration of projected losses due to foreign currency fluctuations. Furthermore, DOD's financial reporting on foreign currency fluctuations for fiscal years 2009 through 2016 contains incomplete and inaccurate information. Without analyzing any realized or projected losses to determine what balance may be needed to meet the FCFD account's intended purpose, the account balance may be kept at a higher level than is necessary. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD conduct a review of the foreign currency rates used at disbursement to determine whether cost-saving opportunities exist by more consistently selecting cost-effective rates at disbursement. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendations, stating that it would benefit from guidance in the Financial Management Regulation that establishes the steps that should be taken for making such corrections. GAO continues to believe that DOD should take steps to improve the quality of the data.",
    "gao_GAO-19-125": "Why GAO Did This Study VA operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the United States. In fiscal year 2018, the department spent about $1.1 billion to modernize its existing system, which is to replace the existing system with a new system, Cerner. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to modernize its system. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA has defined VistA, (2) the costs to develop and sustain VistA, and (3) the actions VA has taken to transition from VistA to the Cerner system. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed VA officials. GAO also reviewed program documentation related to the Cerner system. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken a number of actions to define the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), but additional work remains. Specifically, VA has documented descriptions of the system, including the components that comprise it. However, despite these existing sources, VA officials acknowledged that there is no comprehensive definition of the VistA system. Consequently, VA has completed a number of efforts to better define VistA and understand the environment in which it operates. For example, VA has conducted analyses to better understand the scope of VistA and identify capabilities that can be provided by the Cerner system. However, VA has not yet fully defined VistA, including, for example, identifying performance characteristics of the system and describing the environment in which it operates. VA identified total VistA costs of about $2.3 billion between 2015 and 2017, but could not sufficiently demonstrate the reliability of all data and omitted other costs from the total. The lack of sufficiently reliable and comprehensive costs indicates that the department is not positioned to accurately report the annual costs to develop and sustain VistA. VA has initiated a number of actions to prepare for the transition from VistA to the Cerner system. These actions include (1) taking steps to establish a program office reporting to senior agency management, (2) forming a governance structure, (3) conducting assessments at initial system deployment sites, (4) preparing program plans, and (5) setting an initial program baseline. These actions represent important initial steps to prepare for the transition to the new system. The program office is working to hire staff and establish a joint governance structure to coordinate with DOD on the departments' efforts to implement the Cerner system. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that VA develop and implement a methodology for reliably identifying and reporting the total costs of VistA. VA concurred with GAO's recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-62": "Why GAO Did This Study DHS is responsible for coordinating the nation's CI security and resilience. DHS is also responsible for coordinating the nation's CI security and resilience efforts. GAO was asked to review DHS's efforts to protect critical infrastructure. This report examines (1) DHS's efforts to assess risks to critical infrastructure and (2) how DHS uses CI risk information to inform strategic planning and guide outreach to owners and operators. GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials and representatives from selected sectors. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and representatives from selected sector coordinating councils. What GAO Found The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) primarily assesses the three elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability, and consequence\u2014separately for individual critical infrastructure (CI) assets and sectors. According to DHS officials, these assessments help critical infrastructure owners and operators take actions to improve security and mitigate risks. However, according to selected sector coordinating council representatives from three selected sectors, timely and actionable threat assessment data is the most useful type of risk information. In limited circumstances, DHS generates risk assessments that collectively incorporate all three elements of risk which selected SCC representatives found of limited use for their sectors' infrastructure protection efforts due to the amount of time it takes to finalize the assessment data, the inclusion of risk scenarios that are not likely to occur, and the results not being applicable to individual assets. DHS uses CI risk information in multiple ways, including informing strategic planning and developing analytic products, and at the component level to guide its day-to-day owner and operator outreach and incident response. DHS is also facilitating risk-based cross-sector planning and information sharing through sector coordinating councils. What GAO Recommends GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.

    "gao_GAO-18-460T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for IT in fiscal year 2018. However, as GAO has previously reported, investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. In February 2015, GAO reported that, while progress had been made in improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, significant work still remained to be completed. GAO was asked to testify on the status of federal IT acquisitions and operations. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations, and (2) the extent to which agencies have implemented key IT workforce planning activities. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports and testimonies on federal IT acquisitions and operations. GAO reviewed relevant laws and guidance, and interviewed officials from OMB and agencies. What GAO Found The federal government has taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations. However, agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in cost savings and additional management improvements, if they addressed the numerous recommendations GAO has made aimed at improving data center consolidation, increasing transparency via OMB's IT Dashboard, implementing incremental development, managing software licenses, reviewing IT acquisitions, implementing key IT workforce activities, and addressing aging legacy systems. Specifically, GAO reported that agencies have made progress in consolidating data centers, but need to take action to achieve planned cost savings. For example, as of August 2016, 24 agencies had closed 4,388, and had plans to close a total of 5,597 data centers through fiscal year 2019. Further, 23 agencies reported about $656 million collectively in planned savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. This is about $3.3 billion less than the estimated $4.0 billion in planned savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. To facilitate transparency across the government in acquiring and managing IT investments, OMB established a public website\u2014the IT Dashboard\u2014to provide detailed information on major investments at 26 agencies, including ratings of their performance against cost and schedule targets. GAO has made 47 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to help improve the accuracy and reliability of the information on the Dashboard and to increase its availability. Most agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations or had no comments. As of March 2018, 19 recommendations remained open. GAO also reported that agencies needed to increase their use of incremental development practices. For example, GAO reported that agencies needed to improve their certification of incremental development. GAO recommended that OMB clarify its guidance on incremental development and that the selected agencies update their associated policies to comply with OMB's revised guidance (once made available), and consider the factors identified in GAO's report when doing so. GAO also reported that agencies needed to improve their management of software licenses. GAO recommended that OMB clarify its guidance on incremental development and that the selected agencies update their associated policies to comply with OMB's revised guidance (once made available), and consider the factors identified in GAO's report when doing so. As of March 2018, 34 of the recommendations remained open. GAO also reported that most of the Chief Information Officers (CIO) at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. For example, most of the 22 selected agencies did not identify all of their IT contracts. Further, 14 of the 22 selected agencies did not fully satisfy OMB's requirement that the CIO review and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that GAO evaluated were CIO-reviewed and approved as required by OMB's guidance. The 85 IT contracts not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8 billion. Until agencies ensure that CIOs are able to review and approve all IT acquisitions, CIOs will continue to have limited visibility and input into their agencies' planned IT expenditures and will not be able to use the increased authority that FITARA's contract approval provision is intended to provide.

    "gao_GAO-18-69": "Why GAO Did This Study The technology sector is a growing segment of the U.S. economy. In 2015, the estimated number of workers in the technology workforce\u2014people who worked in mathematics, computing, or engineering occupations\u2014increased at a higher rate (24 percent) than the estimated number of workers in the general workforce (9 percent). GAO was asked to review the representation of women and certain minority groups in the technology workforce. This report examines (1) the demographic trends in the technology workforce over the past 10 years, and (2) the efforts by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to oversee technology companies and technology contractors' compliance with equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements. GAO analyzed data from EEOC and OFCCP, and interviewed EEOC and OFCCP officials. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, EEOC and OFCCP policies, and OFCCP data. What GAO Found From 2005 to 2015, the estimated number of workers in the technology workforce\u2014people who worked in mathematics, computing, or engineering occupations\u2014increased at a higher rate (24 percent) than the estimated number of workers in the general workforce (9 percent). In 2015, the technology workforce comprised an estimated 7.5 million workers, an increase of slightly over 1.4 million workers since 2005. Women and certain minority groups continued to be less represented in the technology workforce and at companies in the technology sector than outside it. Several factors may contribute to the lower representation of women and certain minority groups in the technology workforce and at companies in the technology sector, based on research and interviews with researchers and representatives from workforce and industry organizations and technology companies. These include the lower diversity of degree earners in technology-related fields, and company-based factors such as hiring practices and retention of women and underrepresented minorities. EEOC and OFCCP have taken steps to oversee equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements, but face limitations. EEOC primarily oversees compliance with equal employment opportunity requirements by investigating workers' individual charges of employment discrimination filed against companies. EEOC has publicly acknowledged the low levels of diversity in the technology sector. However, GAO was unable to identify a specific number of charges received by EEOC against companies in industries that are part of this sector because EEOC does not require investigators to record the industry of the charged company. EEOC officials said they believe they have received far fewer charges against technology companies than they would have expected given the public attention to the issue of diversity in the technology sector. EEOC has taken some steps to address diversity in the technology sector, including research and outreach efforts. However, GAO found that EEOC cannot analyze charge data by industry to help identify investigation and outreach priorities, in contradiction to EEOC strategic planning documents and EEOC Inspector General reports, which have emphasized the importance of doing so. By not requiring an industry code in its investigations data, EEOC cannot analyze charge data by industry to help identify investigation and outreach priorities, in contradiction to EEOC strategic planning documents and EEOC Inspector General reports, which have emphasized the importance of doing so. Without analyzing its data on charges across industries, EEOC's ability to proactively identify priorities for its outreach and enforcement resource use is limited. OFCCP faces challenges that may hinder the agency's oversight of technology companies. Specifically, OFCCP reported facing delays in receiving information from federal contractors, including technology companies, but has not yet evaluated whether its own policies and practices also impede its efforts to hold federal technology contractors responsible for the legal requirements to take affirmative action and not discriminate against protected groups. In addition, OFCCP regulations do not require contractors to disaggregate demographic data for the purpose of establishing placement goals for hiring, which may hinder contractors' efforts to implement effective affirmative action programs. Without assessing its current approach to its establishment-based reviews and identifying all relevant subcontractors, OFCCP does not have reasonable assurance that its approach can identify discrimination occurring within the companies it oversees and may be missing opportunities to identify more effective practices or adjust its methods to external changes. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that EEOC develop a timeline to complete its planned effort to clean the EEOC's data for a one-year period and add missing industry code data. EEOC neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations, but stated that it was taking some actions to enhance these data.",
    "gao_GAO-18-534": "Why GAO Did This Study The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented several antifraud efforts that affect durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. CMS began phasing in the competitive bidding program (CBP) in 2008, and the agency began phasing in the non-bid areas in 2016. GAO was asked to review the implementation of adjusted rates in non-bid areas. This report examines (1) the extent to which payment rate reductions have affected beneficiary access to DME items and (2) the extent to which CMS has monitored beneficiary access to DME items since the implementation of adjusted rates. GAO reviewed CMS data on DME suppliers and beneficiary utilization of rate-adjusted items, and interviewed CMS officials and representatives from DME industry trade organizations. What GAO Found The payment rate reductions for durable medical equipment (DME) items in non-bid areas were generally significant. The average unweighted percentage reduction across the top product category items combined\u2014measured by calculating the percentage change between the 2015 non-adjusted and the 2017 fully adjusted rates\u2014was 46 percent. However, payment rate reductions varied by DME product category and by individual item within product categories. For example, the average payment rate reduction for the top items in the oxygen product category\u2014the category that accounted for the highest percentage of total expenditures in 2016\u2014was 39 percent. The number of suppliers furnishing any of the 393 rate-adjusted items to beneficiaries in non-bid areas in 2016\u2014the first year that CMS adjusted payment rates in non-bid areas\u2014decreased 8 percent compared to 2015. This continued a trend of annual decreases going back to at least 2011\u2014the first year CMS began implementing the CBP in nine areas. The largest percentage decrease in suppliers, 13 percent, occurred in 2014 (the year after the CBP was expanded to an additional 100 areas), followed by 9 and 8 percent decreases in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Because 2016 was the most recent year of complete Medicare claims data available at the time of GAO's study, GAO could only review data for the first year that adjusted rates were in effect in non-bid areas and could not determine if these trends continued in 2017. Available evidence indicates no widespread access issues in the first year of reduced Medicare payment rates in non-bid areas. CMS has reported that data from its health status monitoring tool indicate the reduced payment rates have not resulted in changes in access to DME items or health outcomes in non-bid areas in 2016 as compared to 2015. CMS officials told GAO they have not made significant revisions to the tool's underlying methodologies but did create a separate workbook specially tailored to the implementation of the adjusted rates in non-bid areas that includes additional capabilities, such as review of assignment rates. GAO previously conducted an analysis of CMS's methodologies and scoring algorithm that focused on evaluating health outcome trends in CBP areas and found them to be generally sound. CMS officials told GAO they have not made significant revisions to the tool's underlying methodologies but did create a separate workbook specially tailored to the implementation of the adjusted rates in non-bid areas that includes additional capabilities, such as review of assignment rates. GAO interviewed officials from three of CMS's regional offices, who also reported there has not been an increase in the number of DME-related inquiries since adjusted rates went into effect. GAO interviewed representatives from one state hospital association, three beneficiary advocacy groups, and four DME industry trade organizations who provided anecdotal examples of varying degrees of beneficiary access issues in non-bid areas. For example, representatives from one state hospital association told GAO some hospital case managers in non-bid areas have reported difficulty in locating suppliers to provide DME items such as wheelchairs or walkers, but these issues are not widespread. A representative of another beneficiary advocacy group that focuses on a condition in which beneficiaries would typically use oxygen items with adjusted rates told GAO that without a real research instrument, it is difficult to determine if the increase in complaints that her group began receiving in 2016 from beneficiaries in non-bid areas is directly related to the adjusted rates, but she said such reports are anecdotal and she does not think that issues reported are widespread or have created significant hardship. GAO also reviewed several publicly released studies that assessed the effect of the implementation of adjusted rates on beneficiaries, DME suppliers, and others. GAO found these studies did not provide persuasive evidence of substantial effects, primarily because of methodological issues with how the participants in the studies were recruited. Because there is only limited experience on changes in the number of DME suppliers and utilization of DME based on the first year that adjusted rates have been in effect, some effects may take longer to appear, and it is possible that trends could differ in 2017",
    "gao_GAO-18-564": "Why GAO Did This Study The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees the expenditures reported by states on the CMS-64, which captures expenditure data for different aspects of states' Medicaid programs. CMS is required to review these expenditures quarterly. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of state-reported expenditures. This report examines (1) how CMS ensures that state-reported expenditures are supported and allowable and (2) the financial impact of CMS's expenditure reviews. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials. GAO also reviewed CMS's procedures for reviewing state-reported expenditures. GAO also interviewed CMS officials in headquarters and 10 regional offices selected based on the number of Medicaid expenditures reported by states. What GAO Found CMS uses a variety of processes to assure that state-reported expenditures are supported and allowable, but weaknesses limit its ability to effectively target risk. CMS uses a variety of processes to review state-reported expenditures, including quarterly reviews and financial management reviews. GAO found that CMS was identifying errors and compliance issues using both review methods, but weaknesses in how CMS targets its oversight resources to address risks. For example, GAO found that CMS has allocated similar staff resources to states with differing levels of risk. For example, the staff resources dedicated to reviewing California's expenditures\u2014ranking first nationally in expenditures and constituting 15 percent of all federal Medicaid expenditures\u2014are comparable to significantly smaller states in other regions, despite California's history of reporting challenges and its inability to provide electronic records, which requires on-site review. GAO also found that CMS cancelled the financial management review (FMR) requirement for regional offices in 17 out of 51 instances in the last 5 years when faced with resource constraints. GAO also found that CMS's reviewers in the selected regional offices did not consistently perform variance analyses\u2014which compare changes in expenditures from the quarter under review to the previous quarter\u2014of higher matched expenditures during quarterly reviews. Further, the sampling procedures used to examine Medicaid expansion expenditures did not account for varying risks across states. For example, GAO found that the sampling methodology did not account for risk factors like program size or vulnerabilities in state eligibility-determination processes and systems. As a result of the inconsistency in reviews and a sampling methodology that does not consider program risk, errors may be going undetected, resulting in CMS providing federal funds at higher federal matching rates than is allowable. In addition, CMS could be missing opportunities to identify any systemic issues that may contribute to such errors. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CMS complete a comprehensive, national risk assessment and take steps, as needed, to assure that resources are adequate and allocated commensurate with risk. HHS concurred with all three recommendations.",

    "gao_GAO-18-386": "Why GAO Did This Study HIPAA requires that patients have the right to access their medical records. HIPAA also requires that HIPAA-covered entities provide individuals with access to their medical records. GAO was asked to review HIPAA's implementation. This report examines (1) the fees for accessing medical records for patients and third parties, (2) the challenges patients face accessing medical records, and (3) the extent to which HHS enforces patients' right of access to their medical records. GAO reviewed HIPAA and HHS guidance, and interviewed stakeholders from ROI vendors, provider representatives, and patient advocates. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and other stakeholders. What GAO Found Available information suggests that the allowable fees for accessing medical records vary by type of request\u2014that is, whether a patient or third party is making the request\u2014and by state. Federal laws establish limits on the fees that may be charged for two of the three types of requests for medical records: (1) patient requests, when patients request access to their medical records, and (2) patient-directed requests, when patients request that their records be sent to another person or entity, such as another provider. HIPAA does not establish limits on fees for third-party requests. For patient and patient-directed requests, providers may charge a \u201creasonable, cost-based fee\u201d under HIPAA's implementing regulations. In contrast with patient and patient-directed requests, the fees for third-party requests are not limited by HIPAA's reasonable, cost-based standard for access requests and are instead governed by state laws, regulations, or other requirements. For example, states can vary as to whether they establish per-page copy fees, allow providers to charge a flat fee, or charge different fees based on the type of media requested (e.g., electronic copies, X-rays, microfilm, paper, etc.). ROI vendors and other stakeholders GAO interviewed identified challenges patients face accessing medical records, such as high fees. Provider representatives described challenges providers face, including allocating staff time and other resources to respond to requests for medical records. To enforce patients' right of access under HIPAA's Privacy Rule, the HHS Office of Compliance Review (OCR) undertakes four types of efforts. OCR (1) investigates complaints it receives from patients and others regarding access to patient medical records, (2) audits a sample of providers to determine the extent to which their policies and procedures are compliant with HIPAA, (3) reports to Congress on compliance with HIPAA, and (4) educates patients and providers about patients' rights to access their medical records. OCR received a total of 583 patient access complaints between February 2016 and June 2017, closing 437 of these complaints during that same time period. These 437 complaints took anywhere from 11 to 497 days to close. OCR officials stated that while there is no required time frame for closing a patient access case, investigators aim to get patients access to their medical records as soon as possible, which typically occurs before the case is formally closed (i.e., a formal letter is issued to provider and patient).

    "gao_GAO-18-30": "Why GAO Did This Study FEMA's Public Assistance (PA) program provides funds to states and localities to rebuild and restore damaged public infrastructure. FEMA's new delivery model for PA grants is designed to address persistent workforce management challenges, such as identifying the number of staff needed to support the new delivery model. GAO was asked to review FEMA's new delivery model. This report examines (1) the extent to which FEMA designed the new delivery model to address workforce management challenges, and (2) the extent to which FEMA implemented key IT management controls for its new information system. GAO reviewed FEMA's new delivery model and other documents, and interviewed FEMA officials and stakeholders. What GAO Found The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designed the new Public Assistance (PA) delivery model to address persistent workforce management challenges related to identifying the required number of staff and needed skills and training, among other things, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the PA preaward process. To address these challenges, PA program officials centralized much of the responsibility for processing PA projects in the Consolidated Resource Centers (CRC), created additional new positions with specialized roles and responsibilities in program delivery managers, and established training and mentoring programs to help build the new staffs' skills. For example, PA program officials created a new hazard mitigation liaison position for PA program staff at the CRC that did not previously exist at individual JFOs. The other new positions that PA program officials either created or centralized at the CRC included two specialized positions responsible for costing and validating PA projects. Previously, the PA project specialist deployed to the JFO would complete these tasks and others; however, the consistency of project development varied across the regions and disasters. In contrast, CRC staff are full-time employees who receive training to specialize in completing standardized project development steps for PA projects from multiple disasters on an ongoing basis. PA officials have not fully assessed the workforce needed for the new delivery model, including program delivery managers and hazard mitigation specialists, to support full implementation of the new delivery model for all future disasters. Completing a workforce assessment will help program officials identify gaps in their workforce and skills, which could help PA program officials minimize the effects of long-standing workforce staffing and training challenges on the PA program delivery and inform full implementation for all disasters. FEMA's new PA information system is designed to resolve long-standing information sharing challenges, but opportunities exist to fully implement key IT management controls for its new information system. FEMA's new information system is critical to the new delivery model and will be a primary means of sharing grant application documents, tracking ongoing PA projects, and ensuring that FEMA staff and applicants follow PA grant policies and procedures. FEMA's development of FAC-Trax fully satisfied all four IT management controls, but additional steps are needed to fully satisfy the areas of requirements development and systems testing and integration. For example, program officials did not fully satisfy the third control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the fourth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the fifth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the sixth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the seventh control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the eighth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the ninth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the ninth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the seventh control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. Program officials did not fully satisfy the eighth control, analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable. By analyzing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and verifiable, program officials will have greater assurance that FAC-Trax will provide functionality that meets user needs and expectations. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FEMA complete a workforce assessment that identifies the number of staff needed to support the new delivery model nationwide; establish controls for tracking FAC-Trax capabilities to ensure the new information system meets users' needs and expectations; develop system testing criteria to evaluate FAC-Trax; and develop a systems integration plan to define roles and responsibilities of all participants for system integration activities.",
    "gao_GAO-18-409": "Why GAO Did This Study The U.S. energy industry relies on pipelines to transport natural gas from production to end users. These pipelines transport natural gas from wells to processing facilities, which in turn refine it and send it to transmission pipelines. The Pipeline Safety -Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines rulemaking, if approved, will provide PHMSA with more data on gas gathering pipeline infrastructure and incident data. GAO was asked to review the need to odorize gas in pipelines. This report examines (1) the advantages and disadvantages of odorizing gas in pipelines, (2) the views of federal and state pipeline safety officials and industry stakeholders on the need to modify federal regulations for odorizing gas in pipelines, and (3) the views of state pipeline safety officials and industry stakeholders on the need to odorize gas in transmission pipelines. GAO reviewed federal regulations and interviewed federal and state pipeline safety officials and industry stakeholders. GAO also surveyed state pipeline safety officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 49 state pipeline safety officials. What GAO Found Officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed and the state pipeline safety officials GAO surveyed said that the advantage of using sulfur-based odorants to odorize combustible gas transported by pipeline is public safety. Sulfur-based odorants have a low-odor threshold, so are easily detected at low concentrations. With a smell similar to that of rotten eggs, this odor is particularly advantageous when used in distribution pipelines that are located in areas where people congregate (e.g., homes, businesses and hospitals). If individuals smell an odorant, they can call emergency services and alert those nearby of a potential gas leak, possibly helping to prevent an explosion that could result in the loss of life and property. The most common disadvantage of sulfur-based odorants cited by officials and stakeholders GAO contacted is the need to remove the odorant for some industrial processes. Officials from both federal safety regulatory agencies GAO interviewed and approximately half of state pipeline safety officials surveyed said that sulfur-based odorants can cause an adverse chemical reaction during processing for some industries. However, because most transmission pipelines are in less populated areas and not odorized, many manufacturers currently receive unodorized gas from transmission pipelines and do not need to remove odorant. Officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed had mixed views on the need to modify federal regulations for odorizing gas in distribution pipelines. Many officials and stakeholders said that federal requirements to odorize all gas in distribution pipelines are sufficient as written and do not need to be modified. However, requiring all pipelines to be odorized at the federal level would have to be consistent with federal pipeline safety regulations. According to the safety regulations, a risk assessment, including an assessment of the benefits and costs of proposed regulatory standards, is required to be considered in any decision on whether to impose a new safety standard. According to PHMSA officials, they do not have the data to report on any incidents on gathering pipelines where odorant may have made a difference. Moreover, PHMSA officials stated that they do not have the data to formulate an educated opinion or viewpoint as to the need to odorize gathering pipelines. To address this lack of data, the Pipeline Safety -Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines rulemaking, if approved, will provide PHMSA with more data on gas gathering pipeline infrastructure and incident data. According to PHMSA officials, the data collected will inform PHMSA on the best path forward regarding further regulation of gas gathering pipelines, including the need for odorization. Officials, stakeholders and survey respondents generally disagreed about the need to odorize all transmission pipelines. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as well as about half of the stakeholders GAO contacted said the current regulations for odorizing gas in certain transmission pipelines in populated areas were sufficient. Additionally, NTSB officials said they were not aware of incidents where odorants in a transmission pipeline would have alerted the public in time to prevent the incident. These officials and stakeholders generally said that odorizing gas in transmission pipelines is not an effective means of reducing the risk of an incident. For example, one stakeholder said that at the typically high pressure at which most transmission pipelines operate, even a relatively small hole in the pipeline would cause a rupture that would excavate the earth around it so people would hear and see the evidence of the leak. Some experts also said that odorizing all gas transported in the transmission pipeline system would require tens of thousands of odorization facilities. Further, PHMSA officials and representatives from the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America said that the integrity management",

IRS's ISAC is intended to improve collaboration and information sharing among IRS, states, and industry partners. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to prevent and detect identity theft refund fraud. This report (1) describes actions Security Summit partners are taking to implement an ISAC and a Rapid Response Team (RRT); (2) evaluates the extent to which the ISAC pilot design aligns with leading practices; and (3) identifies actions, if any, that IRS could take to improve the ISAC pilot. GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS, state, and industry officials. What GAO Found The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implemented the Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) in 2017 to facilitate information sharing among IRS, state, and industry partners\u2014subject to disclosure prohibitions\u2014by launching an online platform, establishing a governance structure, and recruiting members. IRS and state officials and industry representatives attributed increased trust and improved relationships to IRS's efforts in recent years. Additionally, IRS coordinated with state and industry partners to establish the RRT in 2016, which has been initiated once thus far in 2017. IRS has taken actions that partially align with five leading practices for effective pilot design. For example, IRS has taken steps to communicate with stakeholders before, during, and after forming the ISAC. However, IRS has not translated its objectives into specific, researchable questions that articulate what will be assessed. IRS has not developed criteria for assessing whether the ISAC objectives have been met. Without a measurable evaluation criteria that provide evidence that the ISAC objectives have been met, IRS, its partners, and Congress will have difficulty determining the ISAC's effectiveness and whether to proceed with full-scale implementation. IRS took actions to improve the ISAC pilot, including waiving the requirement for states to contribute data. However, IRS does not have an outreach plan to increase membership or inform states about the ISAC's benefits. IRS waived the data contribution requirement for the first year and one state contributed data to the ISAC in the 2017 filing season. However, as of October 2017, 5 states had contributed data and 8 states had submitted 29 alerts. IRS officials said the agency is considering options to allow it to participate more fully in the ISAC. IRS has not developed an outreach plan to expand membership to additional states, non-Security Summit members of industry, and financial institutions. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that IRS (1) establish criteria for assessing whether the ISAC objectives have been met before making decisions about its scalability and whether, how, and when to proceed to full implementation; and (2) develop a data analysis plan that identifies data sources and criteria necessary for effectively evaluating the ISAC. IRS agreed with both recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-693T": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government is responsible for approving permits to construct and operate oil and gas infrastructure. Permitting is a key component of the permitting process. The Department of the Interior (Interior) is responsible for approving permits to construct and operate oil and gas infrastructure. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for approving permits to construct and operate offshore oil and gas drilling facilities. This testimony discusses factors that affect the timeliness and efficiencies of federal permitting reviews. This statement is based on GAO's past reports on federal energy infrastructure permitting. For the purposes of this statement, GAO has categorized the factors into five broad categories: 1) coordination and communication, 2) human capital, 3) collecting and analyzing accurate milestone information, 4) incomplete applications, and 5) significant policy changes. This statement is based on GAO's prior work on federal energy infrastructure permitting. For the purposes of this statement, GAO has categorized the factors into five broad categories: 1) coordination and communication, 2) human capital, 3) collecting and analyzing accurate milestone information, 4) incomplete applications, and 5) significant policy changes. What GAO Found GAO's past reports have identified a range of factors that can affect permitting timeliness and efficiency. For example, effective coordination and communication between agencies and applicants is a critical factor in an efficient and timely permitting process. Standards for internal control in the federal government call for management to externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives, including by communicating with and obtaining quality information from external parties. GAO found that better coordination between agencies and applicants could result in more efficient permitting. For example, in GAO's February 2013 review of natural gas pipeline permitting, GAO reported that virtually all applications for pipeline projects require some level of coordination with one or more federal agencies, as well as others, to satisfy requirements for environmental review. GAO has reported on coordination practices that agencies use to streamline the permitting process, including the following. Designating a lead coordinating agency. Establishing coordinating agreements among agencies can streamline the permitting process and reduce time required by routine processes. Using mechanisms to expedite routine or less environmentally risky reviews. Human capital. Agency and industry representatives cited human capital factors as affecting the length of permitting reviews. Such factors include having a sufficient number of experts to review applications. For example, in June 2015 and in November 2016, GAO reported concerns associated with the Bureau of Indian Affairs' long-standing workforce challenges, such as inadequate staff resources and staff at some offices without the skills needed to effectively review energy-related documents. In November 2016, GAO recommended that Interior direct BIA to incorporate effective workforce planning standards by assessing critical skills and competencies needed to fulfill BIA's responsibilities related to energy development. Collecting and analyzing accurate milestone information. Agencies often do not track when permitting milestones are achieved, such as the date a project application is submitted or receives final agency approval to determine if they are achieving planned or expected results. In addition, GAO's work has shown that agencies often do not collect accurate information, which prevents them from analyzing their processes in order to improve and streamline them. Incomplete applications. In a 2014 budget document, BLM reported that\u2014due to personnel turnover in the oil and gas industry\u2014operators were submitting inconsistent and incomplete applications for permits to drill, which was delaying the approval of permits. In a February 2013 report, officials from Army Corps of Engineers district offices said that incomplete applications may delay their review because applicants are given time to revise their application information. Deficiencies within agency IT systems may also result in incomplete applications. Changes in U.S. policy unrelated to permitting are a factor that can also affect the duration of federal permitting reviews. For example, in September 2014, GAO reported that the Department of Energy did not approve liquefied natural gas exports to countries without free-trade agreements with the United States for a period of 16 months. GAO found that the Department stopped approving applications while it conducted a study of the effect of liquefied natural gas exports on the U.S. economy and the national interest. In a July 2012 report, GAO found that after the new safety requirements went into effect, review times for offshore oil and gas drilling permits increased, as did the number of times that Interior returned a permit to an operator.

    "gao_GAO-19-90": "Why GAO Did This Study The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA) provides compensation to employees of Energy under Part B and Part E, and provides for the establishment of a Advisory Board on Toxic Substances and Worker Health. The Advisory Board is tasked with providing technical advice to the Secretary of Labor regarding Part E. GAO was asked to review the reopening process. This report examines (1) the number of compensation claims for illnesses resulting from exposure to toxins that were reopened by DOL and their final outcome; (2) the extent to which an advisory board on toxic substances and worker health reviewed and advised DOL on the scientific soundness of DOL's database on toxins and their potential links to occupational diseases; and (3) DOL's response. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DOL data on reopened claims from 2012 through 2017; reviewed DOL program documents; and interviewed DOL officials. What GAO Found The Department of Labor (DOL) reopened more than 7,000 claims filed by contracted Energy employees for exposure to toxins at Energy worksites and approved 69 percent of them. The remaining claims were denied (13 percent), still awaiting a final decision (2 percent), closed (2 percent), deferred (less than 1 percent) or had some other outcome (15 percent). Regardless of a claim's previous status of approved or denied, outcomes after reopening varied by who initiated the reopening. DOL initiated most of the reopenings (80 percent) itself, with fewer reopenings initiated by claimants. Regardless of a claim's previous status of approved or denied, outcomes after reopening varied by who initiated the reopening. DOL officials provided data showing that most of the claims reopened from 2012 through 2017 that were subsequently denied compensation had common reasons, including insufficient medical evidence, ineligible survivors, or maximum benefits already met. DOL officials said that some claimants may have been denied as a result of claimants not understanding the evidence required for a reopening. These officials also said that claimants experience ongoing challenges at different stages of the adjudication process, including reopening, with regard to evidence required to support their claim. In its 2016 annual report to Congress, the Office of the Ombudsman found that DOL's written communication with claimants requesting additional evidence or informing them of the final decision did not clearly explain what specific evidence was needed or why previously submitted evidence was deemed insufficient. In its 2016 annual report, while the Office of the Ombudsman acknowledged DOL's efforts to ensure that decisions on claims are adequately reasoned and documented, and found that some recently issued decisions show improvement, it also found some variation in decision quality among claims examiners. Furthermore, consistent with its 2015 report, it also found that some claimants encounter challenges during the reopening process with written communication that is not clear on the evidence needed to reopen a claim. DOL officials said they have taken a number of steps to assist claimants and improve communication with them, including conducting workshops for claimants' Authorized Representatives covering such topics as the evidence needed to support a claim and how to request a reopening. DOL officials said they recently hired a training analyst to update claimant resources posted to the website and to develop additional training for claims examiners. An assessment of DOL's training which considers claimant concerns could help DOL better understand why some claimants remain confused about the reopening process and do not submit evidence key to supporting their claim. Until then, the agency will be unable to determine whether its training has resulted in improving communication with claimants and to target future training resources effectively. The Advisory Board in 2016 and 2018 recommended DOL incorporate additional, peer-reviewed data sources on the links between toxic substances and illnesses catalogued in the Site Exposure Matrices (SEM), but while DOL previously agreed that doing so would be useful, it has not yet added all the sources recommended by the Advisory Board. According to Advisory Board members, incorporating these additional sources would enhance the SEM by making it more comprehensive and scientifically sound. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOL conduct an assessment of its staff training designed to improve clarity of communication with claimants. DOL neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendation. However, DOL acknowledged that it plans to focus its staff training efforts on a variety of needed training topics, including improving the quality of written communications. DOL also noted that its recently hired training analyst will be responsible for, among other things, designing",
    "gao_GAO-19-116": "Why GAO Did This Study The United States has made a commitment to building Afghanistan's security and governance in order to prevent the country from once again becoming a sanctuary for terrorists. To achieve its security objectives, the United States currently has two missions in Afghanistan: a counterterrorism mission that it leads and the NATO-led Resolute Support train, advise, and assist mission, which it participates in with other coalition nations. The objective of Resolute Support is to establish self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces that work together to maintain security in Afghanistan. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the ANDSF. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD considers and meets their needs when identifying equipment requirements, (2) what has been reported about and the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, and (3) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. GAO reviewed DOD and NATO reports and documents, and interviewed DOD and NATO officials. What GAO Found The Department of Defense (DOD) has reported that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have improved some capabilities related to the functional areas and capability pillars described above, but face several capability gaps that leave them reliant on coalition assistance, according to publicly available DOD reporting. DOD has reported that the Afghan ministries have improved in operational planning, strategic communications, and coordination between the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense at the national level. However, DOD has reported that the ANDSF continues to need support in several key areas, such as force management; logistics; and analyzing and integrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information. DOD and the ANDSF have begun implementing plans and initiatives that aim to strengthen and increase the size of the specialized forces. DOD collects some reliable information about the operation and maintenance abilities of ANDSF specialized forces, in part because advisors are embedded at the tactical level with the specialized forces, according to DOD officials. Specifically, U.S. and coalition forces advise specialized forces at the tactical level under Resolute Support because building ANDSF aviation and special operations abilities are considered particularly important, according to DOD reporting. DOD officials told GAO that since U.S. and coalition forces are embedded at the tactical level for specialized forces, they can monitor, assess, and report on tactical abilities, including the ability to operate and maintain equipment. GAO's analysis of information provided by DOD about the ANDSF's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters illustrates that DOD has some detailed information about specialized forces. However, DOD has limited reliable information on the conventional forces' ability to operate and maintain equipment. For example, DOD officials could not say how well ANDSF personnel on the front lines operate radios in the field and had only limited information on the ANDSF's ability to maintain radios. Federal internal control standards state that U.S. agencies should obtain and process reliable information to evaluate performance in achieving key objectives and assessing risks. Without reliable information on the conventional forces' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, DOD may be unable to fully evaluate the success of its train, advise, assist, and equip efforts in Afghanistan. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that DOD develop and, as appropriate, implement options for collecting reliable information on the ANDSF conventional forces' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. DOD concurred with the recommendation.",
    "gao_GAO-18-11": "Why GAO Did This Study Border Patrol uses a network of roads to conduct its operations, including a network of roads owned by states, counties, cities, and tribal entities. CBP uses these roads to patrol and respond to threats, such as smuggling illegal drugs. CBP also uses nonfederal public roads, which are roads that CBP owns, leases, or has an irrevocable interest in, and therefore has a right to maintain. GAO was asked to review CBP's use of nonfederal public roads. This report examines (1) the extent to which CBP has authorities and arrangements for using and maintaining roads, and (2) the extent to which CBP has documented and communicated its processes and criteria for funding nonfederal public roads. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and policies; analyzed CBP documents; and interviewed CBP and Border Patrol officials. What GAO Found The U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol) has various authorities and arrangements for using and maintaining roads, but documentation and communication of its processes and criteria for funding nonfederal public roads are limited. Border Patrol generally has access to public roads to the same extent as other users, and has certain authorities to use other federal, state, local, tribal, and private owned roads. According to local, tribal, and Border Patrol sector officials, CBP uses and is sometimes the primary user of roads owned by states, counties, cities, and localities, but does not have a specific appropriation to engage in public improvements, including the maintenance and repair of such roads it uses for border security operations. CBP uses Comprehensive Tactical Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) contracts to address maintenance of roads, as well as all other TI it uses for its operations, through CTIMR contracts and agreements. CBP has documented arrangements with federal, state, and local agencies and with some private landowners to maintain the roads it uses for its operations; however, it has not consistently documented its arrangements with these landowners or shared the arrangements it has documented with Border Patrol sector officials. For example, CBP has an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, through which it allocates $1.5 million annually to the U.S. Forest Service to maintain roads the Border Patrol Tucson sector uses in the Coronado National Forest. However, CBP has not consistently documented arrangements with all such owners. Further, CBP has not shared documented arrangements with all relevant Border Patrol sector officials, including officials responsible for prioritizing sector road maintenance funding needs. Border Patrol uses any funding that remains after owned operational road requirements are addressed to maintain non-owned operational roads; however, Border Patrol has not clearly documented or shared the process and criteria it uses for prioritizing maintenance of the non-owned operational requirements with sector officials. Border Patrol uses any funding that remains after owned operational road requirements are addressed to maintain non-owned operational roads; however, Border Patrol has not clearly documented or shared the process and criteria it uses for prioritizing maintenance of the non-owned operational requirements with sector officials. Border Patrol officials said that the process and criteria it uses for making decisions on funding non-owned operational requirements are not clearly documented and are not shared with Border Patrol sector officials. By clearly documenting and communicating the process and criteria it uses for making decisions on funding non-owned operational requirements, ORMD could better ensure that sector officials are aware of the process and criteria, and can therefore better plan for and anticipate funding to meet their sector road maintenance needs. CBP's inability to maintain certain public roads that are in poor condition can negatively affect Border Patrol's relations with local governments and communities. Officials from six of the nine southwest Border Patrol sectors GAO contacted reported that poorly maintained public roads negatively affect their ability to respond to threats because of limited road access or increased response times, and cause additional wear and tear on vehicles. For example, a 14-mile stretch of a public, county road they use to access a forward operating base is severely rutted, limiting agents' ability to access the southernmost points of their patrol area. In addition, officials from the Tohono O'odham Nation told GAO they do not have sufficient appropriation funding to maintain a 28-mile, major, public thoroughfare leading to a Border Patrol forward operating base and the border. CBP and Border Patrol officials have discussed two options that, if implemented, could offer possible mechanisms for addressing maintenance of nonfederal public roads. However, officials also discussed challenges each option would present to CBP, and CBP has not assessed these or other options for addressing maintenance of the state, county, city, and other local roads it uses for its operations. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that CBP develop and implement a policy and related guidance for documenting arrangements with landowners, and",
    "gao_GAO-19-201": "Why GAO Did This Study CBSI was created in 2010 to increase citizen safety and security in the Caribbean region. CBSI aims to reduce illicit trafficking, improve public safety and security, and promote social justice. GAO was asked to review CBSI. This report (1) provides information on U.S. funding for CBSI activities, (2) examines the extent to which State and USAID have implemented a planning and reporting process for CBSI, and (3) examines the extent to which State and USAID have established objectives and performance indicators to measure the progress of CBSI activities. GAO analyzed U.S. funding data for fiscal years 2010 through 2018, reviewed relevant planning and reporting documents, and interviewed State and USAID officials in Washington, D.C. and in Barbados, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. What GAO Found From fiscal years 2010 through 2018, U.S. agencies have allocated more than $560 million in funding for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). Since fiscal year 2012, annual allocations have remained relatively constant, ranging between $56.6 million and $63.5 million. Of the 13 CBSI partner countries, U.S. agencies have provided the most CBSI funding to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the countries covered by the Eastern Caribbean embassy. State and USAID disbursed funds to support activities in partner countries that improve law enforcement and maritime interdiction capabilities, support activities to train and otherwise improve the capabilities of national security institutions, prevent crime and violence, and deter and detect border criminal activity. These activities are generally aligned with the three pillars of CBSI. The United States and Caribbean countries meet periodically to set strategic goals and to designate high-level priorities for the subsequent year, and U.S. agencies individually plan and report on CBSI activities on a country-specific basis through a variety of reporting mechanisms. However, State has not established an initiative-wide mechanism for planning and reporting on CBSI activities and the U.S. government cannot assess initiative-wide progress. State and USAID set strategic goals and priorities with CBSI partner countries and plan for and report on CBSI activities within each agency or bureau. However, State has not established a CBSI-wide planning and reporting mechanism that links CBSI activities to overall goals or specifies a means for assessing initiative-wide progress through articulation of desired results, performance indicators, and a monitoring and evaluation plan. Without such a mechanism, the ability to demonstrate the efficacy of the initiative, and to emphasize positive results that have been achieved, is limited. State and USAID have established objectives and performance indicators for selected CBSI activities that GAO reviewed and have been measuring and reporting on progress for those activities. Within State, INL and implementing partners have established objectives and performance indicators for all of the activities that GAO reviewed, and INL and the Department of Defense (DOD) receive quarterly monitoring reports containing performance information on the Technical Assistance Field Team program. In response to identified weaknesses in its program monitoring, INL is taking steps to improve program monitoring for its Western Hemisphere programs, which include CBSI activities. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that State, in consultation with USAID and other stakeholders as appropriate, create an initiative-wide planning and reporting mechanism for CBSI that includes the ability to monitor, evaluate, and report the results of their collaborative efforts. State concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-64": "Why GAO Did This Study The financial services industry includes a variety of industries, including credit, financial services, and insurance. GAO has previously reported on the challenges faced by the financial services industry in promoting and retaining a diverse workforce. GAO was asked to examine (1) trends in management-level diversity in the financial services industry, (2) trends in diversity among potential talent pools, and (3) challenges financial services firms identified in trying to increase workforce diversity and practices firms used to increase workforce diversity. GAO analyzed 2007\u20132015 workforce data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compared the representation of racial/ethnic minorities and women in management positions across all three sectors from 2007 through 2015. GAO also interviewed representatives from 13 financial services firms that were actively involved in workforce diversity efforts, representatives of 11 organizations that advocate for the financial services industry, and representatives of 4 individuals who formerly worked for large financial services firms. What GAO Found Representation of minorities at the overall management level increased by 3.7 percentage points from 2007 through 2015 and their representation among senior-level managers increased by 1.7 percentage points during this time. Women's representation at the overall management level has remained at about 45 percent from 2007 through 2015. Among the various sectors of the financial services industry, the insurance sector has consistently had the highest proportion of women in management positions while the banks and other credit institutions sector has consistently had the highest proportion of racial/ethnic minorities in management. As the size of financial services firms increase (by number of employees), the representation of minorities in overall management increased and the representation of women in overall management was generally the same. Additionally, management-level diversity in the financial services sector has similarities and differences compared to other sectors. Representatives from financial services firms and other stakeholders described many of the same challenges in recruiting and retaining women and racial/ethnic minorities as GAO has previously reported, including negative perceptions of the financial services industry that might discourage potential candidates. Practices that financial services firms use to address these challenges include broadening recruitment efforts, establishing relationships with student groups and professional organizations, and providing training on unconscious bias. Representatives from all of the financial services firms GAO met with agreed on the importance of analyzing employee data to assess diversity of their workforce and identify trends that may need to be addressed. However, representatives and other stakeholders differed on the benefits of making firm-level information on employee diversity publicly available.",
    "gao_GAO-19-221": "Why GAO Did This Study The federal government collects hundreds of billions of dollars from fees, fines, and penalties each year that fund a wide variety of programs, but Congress and the American public do not have government-wide data on these collections that would provide increased transparency and facilitate oversight. GAO was asked to review government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties. This report examines (1) the extent to which government-wide data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publicly available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight, and (2) the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of specific fees, fines, and penalties including data elements that facilitate congressional oversight. GAO reviewed government-wide data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties, and interviewed officials from OMB, Treasury, and external organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and data transparency. What GAO Found The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and agencies publicly report some data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties, but the data have significant limitations. OMB reports budgetary and financial data in various parts of the Budget of the U.S. Government, including Analytical Perspectives, the Budget Appendix, and the Public Budget Database. Treasury reports financial data in the Combined Statement. Each source provides information for a broader purpose than reporting on collections of fees, fines, and penalties. OMB staff said that OMB does not publicly report these data because the purpose of Analytical Perspectives is to develop or support the President's policies and more detailed tables may not be included if they are not considered necessary for that purpose. However, Analytical Perspectives also serves to provide other significant data that place the President's Budget in context and assist the public and policymakers in better understanding the budget proposals. Until OMB makes more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties maintained in its OMB MAX database\u2014such as collections by agency\u2014publicly available, Congress has limited information on such collections to inform oversight and decision-making. OMB and Treasury do not consistently report data that would facilitate congressional oversight of fees, fines, and penalties. For example, OMB does not consistently report data on the amount collected annually, account balances, and whether the collection is a fee, fine, or penalty. According to OMB staff and officials from Treasury, the Congressional Research Service, and external organizations with expertise in federal budget issues and data transparency, there are two primary benefits to government-wide reporting of fee, fine, and penalty data: increased transparency and better information for congressional oversight and decision-making. Generally, all congressional staff GAO spoke with said making additional government-wide data on fees, fines, and penalties, such as those data elements described previously, without additional outreach to agencies, would be useful and increase transparency. While some congressional staff said such data elements are available through direct outreach to agencies, other congressional staff said they could not always obtain the information they wanted. For example, staff from a congressional committee said that one of the most critical data elements for the purpose of congressional oversight is information on agency reporting of obligations and expenditures because, in their view, currently many agencies do not adequately report this information and some agencies do not report this information at all. These data would provide Congress a more complete picture of individual agencies' activities and any potential overlap or duplication in multiple agencies' activities. Finally, publicly available government-wide data on collections could inform the public, specifically payers of fees, fines, and penalties, and facilitate their participation in public comment opportunities. For example, OMB staff said government-wide data could provide the public with clear, transparent information across agencies on fee collections and allow the public to analyze differences in fee programs among agencies. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that OMB (1) make more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties maintained in its OMB MAX database, (2) regularly review and update implementation of its criteria for designating accounts with fees, and (3) describe in the Public Budget Database User's Guide that budget authority is reported net of any offsetting collections, such as collections of fees, fines, and penalties. OMB and Treasury neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-518": "Why GAO Did This Study FSA administers the federal student aid program, which provides loans, grants, and work-study funds to students attending college or career school. FSA shares personally identifiable information (PII) with its non-school partners, such as loan servicers, guaranty agencies, and private collection agencies. GAO was asked to review FSA's oversight of the protection of PII. This report (1) describes the roles of FSA's non-school partners in the federal student financial aid program, including the types of personally identifiable information shared with them; and (2) assesses the extent to which FSA's policies and procedures for overseeing non-school partners' protection of federal student aid data align with federal requirements, federal guidance, and best practices. GAO reviewed FSA documents and interviewed FSA officials. What GAO Found The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) shares PII with its non-school partners to assist them in carrying out key aspects of the federal student financial aid program. These partners include FFEL lenders, Title IV loan servicers, guaranty agencies, and private collection agencies. FSA shares a large amount of PII that it collects from students and parents with its non-school partners. This is particularly significant in that FSA directly manages or oversees more than 203 million student loans made to approximately 43 million borrowers. FSA has established policies and procedures for overseeing its non-school partners' protection of the PII that it shares with the partners. These policies and procedures vary in the extent to which they address the key practices for overseeing the protection of PII. For example, FSA's policies and procedures for Title IV loan servicers and private collection agencies fully address three of the four key practices. For guaranty agencies, FSA's procedures require onsite assessments but do not require monitoring controls on an ongoing basis. Finally, for FFEL lenders, FSA has minimal oversight procedures. FSA established high-level requirements for FFEL lenders to protect student aid data, but it exercises minimal oversight to ensure implementation of security and privacy protections for these data. FSA did not fully specify risk-based security and privacy controls for FFEL lenders. Specifically, FSA's application for access to FSA data does not require lenders to implement a baseline set of risk-based security and privacy controls based on the impact level of the affected information and systems. FSA officials stated that they plan to add security and privacy requirements to the FFEL lender participation agreements as part of their next update during the 2018 revision cycle, but they did not specify what requirements would be included in these revised agreements. Until FSA establishes specific requirements for lenders' protection of data, it will lack assurance that information it shares is being protected in a manner consistent with FSA's determination of its sensitivity. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that FSA (1) enroll loan servicers in FSA's continuous monitoring program and (2) modify FSA's agreements with guaranty agencies to specify a required baseline of security controls based on the impact level of the information shared with these agencies, as determined by FSA. FSA generally concurred with GAO's recommendations.",
    "gao_GAO-18-394": "Why GAO Did This Study HUD is responsible for addressing lead paint hazards in housing. HUD's lead hazard control grant programs and its two largest rental assistance programs serve the most families with children: the Housing Choice Voucher and public housing programs. HUD's lead hazard control grant programs are administered by HUD's Lead Office and the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH). GAO was asked to review HUD's lead hazard control grant programs. This report examines (1) HUD's efforts to (1) incorporate statutory requirements and other relevant federal standards in its lead grant programs; (2) monitor and enforce compliance with lead paint regulations for its rental assistance programs; (3) adopt federal health guidelines and environmental standards for lead hazards in its lead grant and rental assistance programs; and (4) measure and report on its performance related to making housing lead-safe. GAO reviewed relevant laws, HUD's lead grant programs, and HUD's lead hazard control grant programs; analyzed HUD's grant data from 2013 through 2017; and interviewed HUD staff. What GAO Found The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has incorporated relevant requirements for awarding recent lead grants, but could better document and evaluate its grant processes. HUD's lead grant programs have incorporated Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Title X) statutory requirements through recent annual funding notices and their grant processes. HUD has established processes for reviewing and scoring grant applications using these evaluative criteria, and selects grant recipients based on the review scores. HUD has also developed a framework to assess the risk posed by applicants for competitive grants. However, HUD has not fully documented or evaluated its lead grant processes in reviewing and scoring the grants and making award decisions. For example, HUD's application review guide describes its grant application review and award processes at a high level but does not provide detailed guidance for staff as to how tasks should be performed. HUD has begun to develop analyses and tools to inform its efforts to target outreach and ensure that grant awards go to areas of the country that are at risk for lead paint hazards. However, HUD has not developed time frames for incorporating the results of the analyses into its lead grant programs' processes. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks. Setting specific time frames could help to ensure that HUD operationalizes this model in a timely manner. HUD could take additional steps to monitor compliance with lead paint regulations for nearly 4,000 PHAs. HUD's compliance monitoring processes rely in part on PHA self-certifications that they are in compliance with lead paint regulations, but recent investigations have found that some PHAs may have falsely certified that they were in compliance. HUD's new compliance monitoring approach has some limitations that create risks. By adopting procedures that clearly describe when lead paint hazard compliance efforts are no longer sufficient and enforcement decisions are needed, HUD can better keep PHAs accountable in a consistent and timely manner. HUD's lead dust standards align with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standards for its rental assistance programs and exceed EPA standards for the lead grant programs. HUD's lead dust standards align with EPA standards for its rental assistance programs and exceed EPA standards for the lead grant programs. HUD has taken limited steps to measure, evaluate, and report on the performance of its programmatic efforts to ensure that housing is lead-safe. First, HUD has tracked one performance measure for its lead grant programs but lacks comprehensive performance goals and measures. Second, while HUD has evaluated the effectiveness of its Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control grant program, it has not formalized plans and does not have a time frame for evaluating its lead paint regulations. Third, HUD has not issued an annual report on the results of its lead efforts since 1997. By incorporating key elements of performance assessment--by developing comprehensive goals, improving performance measures, and adhering to reporting requirements--could better enable HUD to assess its own progress and target its resources toward lead efforts that maximize impact. What GAO Recommends GAO recommends that HUD (1) more fully document its processes for scoring and awarding lead grants and (2) set time frames for incorporating relevant data on lead paint hazard risks into its lead grant programs' processes. HUD disagreed with one of GAO's recommendations and generally agreed with the remaining eight.",
    "gao_GAO-18-349T": "Why GAO Did This Study The 2017 Act requires VA to develop a comprehensive plan for implementing and administering the new appeals process. The Act also requires GAO to assess VA's plan against the Act's requirements. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which VA's plan addresses the Act's requirements, (2) the extent to which VA's plan reflects sound planning practices, and (3) the extent to which VA's plan addresses the Act's requirements. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed VA's plan against the Act's requirements, interviewed VA officials, and reviewed VA's plan and supplemental materials. What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) appeals plan addresses 17 of the 22 required elements in the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (the Act). VA's plan addresses the required elements related to, among others, identifying legal authorities for hiring and removing employees, estimating timeliness for hiring and training employees, and outlining the outreach VA expects to conduct. VA's plan reflects certain sound planning practices, such as convening a working group on performance tracking; however, the plan could improve its planning practices related to monitoring and assessing performance on a range of key dimensions of success. For example, VA's plan does not articulate a set of goals and measures that cover all aspects of its new appeals process, such as accuracy of decisions and cost. VA's plan also does not provide details on the metrics the agency will develop, how it will assess if the new appeals process is an improvement over the legacy process, and how it will monitor the allocation of resources between legacy and new appeals claims. VA's plan reflects certain aspects of sound planning practices related to managing the implementation of process change; however, other key components are not addressed. For example, VA's appeals plan includes an assessment of risks associated with implementing the new appeals process, but could more comprehensively reflect key risks posed by such a significant reform effort. For example, VA's plan does not clearly define success criteria for the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP), which is intended to reduce veterans' legacy appeals by providing them with a chance for early resolution of their claims within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) while the Board focuses on reducing its inventory of legacy appeals. However, VA's plan does not clearly define success criteria for RAMP, and VA's plan does not articulate how it will assess RAMP before proceeding with full implementation. Without fully articulating its plan for deciding how and when to roll out changes more broadly, it is not clear whether VA would be prepared to fully implement a new appeals process that achieves its aim of better serving veterans. What GAO Recommends GAO is making recommendations to address the Act's requirements. VA agreed with GAO's assessment and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."
